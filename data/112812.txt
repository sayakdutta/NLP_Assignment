 Rick, et al:
 
 Thank you so much for such a special evening.  I really enjoyed dinner, and the rare occasion to catch up with all of you.  It meant a lot to me that you were willing to give up an evening with your family to wish me well.  
 
 It has truly been a privilege to work with such talented colleagues (as Amr would say).  I will miss working with you, and I will miss your friendship.  
 
 Thanks again.
