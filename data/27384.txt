 
 Yes, but we are consistenly being OOMC'd,  so it's kind of an ongoing question.
 Thanks,

 If you are referring to the OOMC for September 14th we are still working
 on a number of issues pertaining to that trade day.

 Mark,
 Thanks for your reply concerning ancillary service procurement.    I was
 wondering if Ercot had made a decision on OOM capacity payments.
 Our position is that our custmers,  ie.   Teco/Frontera   should recover
 at least their O&M expenses for the capacity,  as they are standing by
 awaiting instruction.
 
 Has there been any progress in this subject?
