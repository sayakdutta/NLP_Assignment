 
 FYI,
 The system is now open and you should have recieved an email regarding 
 access.  You need to select 5 people to review you.  Please select people 
 from different groups and I would suggest putting your trader on the list.  
 Also, please send me a list of accomplishments for this six months.  This 
 will help me in drafting my review to help represent you in the review 
 meetings.  If you were not an enron employee on 1/1/2001, you will not be 
 ranked with other members or your job classification, but you will still 
 recieve a review.  Please shout with any questions.  Don't forget the 
 deadlines from the original email.
