 Rika,
 Just a verification on the December 3-4, 2001 conference meeting in New
 York.  I am bringing it up again now because the early registration discount
 ($200) expires this week.
 As a reminder, the meeting includes discussions on major nuclear,
 generation, and transmission topics by all the key officials (Meserve-NRC,
 Wood-FERC, Blake-DOE, Bingaman-Senate, Connaughton-White House,
 Bayless-Dynegy, Peterson-NRG Energy, Rogers-Cinergy).
 Conference cost - $1395 (We pay time and expenses).
 Again, I'm bringing this up only because of the discount expiration coming
 up.  After this, I won't bother you with it again.
 It seems a valuable opportunity to understand the direction from all
 governmental regulators plus major industry viewpoints.
 If we do this meeting, the count for all completed and scheduled meetings
 through December will be six out of the contract allowable ten.  That gives
 a backlog of four meetings; a rate of 1.2 meetings per month; and a
 projected contract year completion of 14.5 meetings out of an allowable 24.
 Let me know.
 Dan
