 Here are my thoughts so far:
 
 1.  Initial Legal Team -- Jeff Hodge, Jim Keller, Carol St. Clair, Aaron 
 Rothwarg
 
 2.  Spot Check the Forms -- over the next week
 
 3.  Conform Forms to ENA Forms -- over next two months
 
 4.  Develop Form Approval Process -- dual approvals by EES and ENA
 
 5.  Develop Deal Approval Process -- deals above a certain size (or material 
 variations from the form) would require concurrent EWS approval
 
 6.  Request List of Major Contract Concerns from Traders -- items that cannot 
 be hedged
