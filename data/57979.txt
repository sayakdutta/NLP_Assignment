 sent me and attach to an e-mail to Robert Zoellick and Irwin Stelzer with 
 this message from me:  Attached is some background information on the

 Steve, I understand that you are developing a campaign for California, 
 considering all of media attention that has been placed on this state.  I 
 publish a weekly deregulation report and it contains some information that 
 may prove useful.  The report is attached.
