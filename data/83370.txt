 Re: Meeting to Address Processing Plant Issues
 
 Transco has been asked by several of its customers to 
 address the dynamics of gas processing and its corresponding 
 impact on gas quality and the overall operations on the 
 Transco system.  In response, Transco will host a meeting in 
 Houston from 1:00 - 4:00 p.m. on Wednesday,  October 17, 
 2001 at the Williams Tower to bring together 
 producer/operators, processing plant operators and local 
 distribution companies.  
 
 The meeting will be in a round-table discussion format to 
 enable a wide-ranging, open dialogue among participants that 
 are impacted by the dynamics of gas prices and processing 
 margins. 
 
 Please RSVP to Rosina Freeman at 713-215-4054 by Friday, 
 October 12, 2001 so that the appropriate facilities can be 
 made available.  
 
 
 Ronald C. Doyle, Director Gas Management and Control
