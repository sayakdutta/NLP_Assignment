 We are tracking the poll numbers and trends heading into the election.  Still 
 too close to call, but momentum may be swinging back to Gore.
 
 The major tracking polls: Bush Leading in 4, Gore in 1.
 
        ABC    CNN    MSNBC  Voter  W.Post
 Bush   48     49     43     44     47
 Gore   46     42     45     40     45
 
 
 Note that Bush is leading in West Virginia and Louisiana, what should be Gore 
 states, but Gore is leading in Florida and Ohio, two "must-win" Bush states.  
 Gore is trending favorably in large vote-rich states including not only 
 Florida and Ohio, but also New Jersey and Pennsylvania as well as traditional 
 Democratic strongholds such as Minnesota and Wisconsin.  One caveat is that 
 today's NYT Florida poll is the flip of yesterday's Florida Sun Sentinel 
 Florida poll that showed Bush leading (46-41).  Bush has changed his schedule 
 and is on his way to Ohio tonight.
