 Joe,
 
 The guys who teach auto for us said that if I do have to go with gas,
 that the 502 is a much "healthier" engine than the 454.  Any idea of the
 cost of 502's?
 
 Thanks
 
 
     
 
 
 
 
     
 
 
 
 
     
 
 Diesel Engine  $ 6275.00
 
 454 Engine  $ 3350.00
 
 These are your cost.
 
 Rick Darnell
