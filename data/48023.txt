 
 If you are in Houston on Feb 10 and HAVE NOT PLANNED ON HAVING DINNER WITH 
 ME, then just don't plan on coming.  I mean, after your last lame excuse 
 about that hotel by the airport, I'm gonna take it real personal if the only 
 hotel room you can get this time is in Pearland.  Ya know what I mean...
 
 Anyway, I have been thinking about you and wondering what you're up to.  For 
 the Enron Corp. Legal Conference, real cool people (like me) are signing up 
 for the raft trip, so as long as the weather's nice we're going to be 
 floating down the Guadalupe drinking some brews.  So if you were cool you'd 
 be hanging out with the cool group (like me)...what are your plans?!!
