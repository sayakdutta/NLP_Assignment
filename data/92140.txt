 dedicated as you are.

 At that rate you will pay to get out of Houston right?     No worries, there 
 is still another game on the 20th and the Season begins Feb 27th (this one is 
 for points. The other two are Pre-season but still very competitive because 
 they are organized by the league).  By the 27th, maybe you will already have 
 finished GMAT. 
 
 So, I guess I should not even worry about having told Purvi right?    Well, 
 if you finish the benchmark early, you know where to go, but don't worry. I 
 won't be expecting you. Let me know what you hear from Laura (if that is how 
 you spell her name).  I will talk to the MD after lunch I guess. I'll let you 
 know what the outcome was. 
 There is absolutely nothing to do. I am educating myself by reading some 
 things about Acquisitions.
