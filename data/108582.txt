 the goal is to have people rotate into your group directly, or from the gas 
 fundamentals group if possible, and vice versa.  
 
 Keep me updated, and you, I and Lavo will work this out.  Jeff
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
    
 JS:
 Several analysts have approached me with the desire to join me in EGM. What 
 are the limitations on this? Also Dutch quigley is interested in coming over 
 as well. He would like to start in research with a view that he would later 
 trade or market something in EGM.
 Thanks
 Jen
