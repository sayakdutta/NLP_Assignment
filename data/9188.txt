 Sally,
 
 Per your request during our meeting this morning, attached is the spreadsheet 
 with the changes we discussed.  Bryce, Lisa and myself will continue to work 
 on the statistic updates (i.e. number of counterparties, responsible party, 
 etc.) as we discussed.  If you have any questions, please let us know.
