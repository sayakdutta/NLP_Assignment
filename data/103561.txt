 
 It's true!  I am not really a lost friend, but a friend with a lost head!  I 
 may not have time to call you today, but then again I might.  But I will call 
 before the weekend.  Sara
 
 
 
 

    
 
 
 Sara:
 
 I have not heard from you in a while. Are you still checking your
 emails? Maybe not, if I do not receive an answer or are you just real
 busy. I sent you an email about the Gordon etc etc. duck lunch a while
 back. Monty says hello, and asked if you "were still fine".
