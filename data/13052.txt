 
 Mark,
 
 Unfortunately, I do not know anything about EcoElectrica.  I contacted 
 Michelle Blaine at the former EI (thinking that there was some confusion 
 between Blaine and Cash).  Her assistant contacted me and said that, 
 apparently, Coralina Rivera at the former EI has information about Eco 
 Electrica in Puerto Rico.  I have left Coralina a message indicating that you 
 are looking for information about EcoElectrica and requesting that she 
 contact you directly.
 
 Let me know if I can do anything further on this matter.
 
 Michelle

 Jeff,
 
 do you know yet to whom at V&E Houston these docs should be sent? We would 
 like a copy in the UK so we may ask your Houston office to do the honours and 
 copy their set over to us.
 
 Thanks.
 
 
 
        Mark
