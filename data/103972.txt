 the past ENE has only issued a guaranty to Paribas, ED&F Mann and Bank One in 
 connection with ENA's futures/special margin arrangements.  I'll be speaking 
 with Paul Radous in credit.  Do you see any issues here?  Sara

 Bill and Sara,
 We have been talking with Goldman Sachs, one of ECT Investment's prime 
 brokers,  about ways to reduce our margin requirement and gain greater 
 leverage.  Goldman suggested that we may want to consider putting an Enron 
 Guaranttee in place.  
 
 We also have a prime broker agreement with Morgan Stanley.  Per the 
 documentation that I have... I do not see a guarantte with Morgan Stanley.
 
 1) Can you confirm that no guarantee exists with either Goldman or Morgan?
 2) Any comments regarding a Goldman guarantee by Enron Corp for ECT 
 Investments Inc.?
 
 Thanks, Sheila
