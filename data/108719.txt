 Hunter:  John called Chris Williams today asking what was happening, so I 
 returned his call and told him that I would check.  He interviewed with you 
 and your group on 8/22/2000, and it appears that John may have been a 
 candidate for your 4:00 am analyst position.   From our conversation today, I 
 would guess that he was too experienced (and,thus,too expensive), but I don't 
 know if there is yet another position I am not aware of.    Would you give me 
 an update on his status so that I can call him back?
 
 Thanks,
 Molly
