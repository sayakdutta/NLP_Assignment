 
 thanks for note. laid off two thirds of staff on monday. have learned a tremendous amount and may go on lecture circuit. i wonder if a board of directors would pay to hear my story? all is ok thanks, rick
 
 
     
 
 I assume that you are doing OK.
 
 While it's painful now, several years ahead you will be able to look back on

 hang in.
 
 reach out if you need help.
