 Is this something Hunter was interested in?  Will you forward this information to him and reply back to Stuart Fieldhouse about Hunter attending one of these demos.

 Hi Ina, 
 My colleague Joy Pardillo has contacted you regarding a demo for some messaging software as a possible replacement for the Amtel Unit, which you are attending at 12.30pm. 
 In addition to this, we have some software that puts the intercom on to the PC as well, which we would be very keen for Hunter Shively, and any other traders who might be interested, to have a look at. Could you ask Hunter if he would like to see a demo of the software at some time today. We have room 22C1 booked for the following times today. If he cannot make any of these times, let me know and I will sort out a location. 
 11:30 a.m. - 12:30 p.m. 
 12:30 p.m. - 1:30 p.m.
 The latest a demo could take place is 3pm. 
 Many thanks
 Stuart Fieldhouse
