 
 My suggestion for improving the process within the risk group is to do a 
 better job of verifying all term deals are coming to the cash desk at mid.
 
 I believe a large improvement can be made in the settlements area.  The forms 
 are not accurate, the entire support is not attached and the form they are 
 usign does not properly divide the variance between the three possible areas 
 causing a variance, desk price, UA4, firm volumes.
