 I am writing this email to express some concern that I have that has
 been gnawing at me over the past week.
 
 It is a concern over a feeling that each of us is having.  It's a
 feeling of having too much to do.  Too much practice, too much homework,
 too much football, too much baseball, too much of everything!
 
 I caught myself recently telling someone about our kids schedules in an
 exacerbated way and after completing my sentence it hit me.  What I
 realized was that I was complaining about something that was probably
 one of the most wonderful "problems" that a parent or child could have.
 
 
 To have children that have the ability to play sports, the opportunity
 to excel in school and have parents that care enough about them to
 support all that they do is a true blessing, not a problem.  I am sure
 that there are hundreds of thousands of kids in this city alone that
 would pay money to trade places with each of us.
 
 I have found a poem that I wanted to share with each of you that I think
 says a lot.  To me it says that we should be setting an example for our
 kids.  Encouraging their hard work at school and in sports, not
 discouraging it through negative comments about having too much to do.
 If we all as parents start to "talk-up" school, practice, football,
 baseball, etc. about how fun it is and how great it is to be with such a
 great group of kids, the results will be amazing!
 
 Little Eyes Upon You
 
 There are little eyes upon you
 and they're watching night and day.
 There are little ears that quickly
 take in every word you say.
 There are little hands all eager
 to do anything you do;
 And a little boy who's dreaming
 of the day he'll be like you.
 
 You're the little fellow's idol,
 you're the wisest of the wise.
 In his little mind about you
 no suspicions ever rise.
 He believes in you devoutly,
 holds all that you say and do;
 He will say and do, in your way,
 when he's grown up just like you.
 
 There's a wide eyed little fellow
 who believes you're always right;
 And his eyes are always opened,
 an he watches day and night.
 Your setting an example
 every day in all you do,
 For the little boy who's waiting
 to grow up to be like you.
