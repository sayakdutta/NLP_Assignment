 
 EOG interconnect is finishing this week and will be in service by this 
 weekend.  It will initially flow 8-10000/day and will increase to over 15000.

 I'm preparing a "cheat sheet" for Steve for a presentation he is making 
 tomorrow.  There is a slide about our new or proposed supply interconnects.  
 Please send me an email with the capacity/volume and projected in-service (or 
 if it's already in-service) for your project.  If I have the wrong people, 
 please let me know.
 
 Please send this to me this afternoon by 4:30.  Thank you!!
