 
 More questions:
 
 We have two different levels of guarantee values.  We have the specific 
 performance levels, which if not met can result in termination, etc.  This 
 includes emissions, electrical output, heat rate, water (consumption and 
 discharge).  Will all of these have  more stringent guaranteed levels that 
 FCE will have to work to try to fix?  I'm assuming there are no sound 
 issues.  
 
 Thanks again,
