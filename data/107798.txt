 we can have a head exploding contest.  actually, mine is just spinning right 
 now.  how was prc?
 
 
    
 We must work on the housewarming!  I decided best to do it with no 
 furniture.  Early Feb I think.  N.O. sounds great.  Have I mentioned my head 
 may explode and that the video will be on "Amazing Home Videos" on the WB?

 crazy two days, then off to New Orleans until sunday for a conference.  I am 
 really excited, but I hate leaving town when I am so busy.  what did you do 
 this weekend?  oh...Harold wants to know when the house-warming is?
 
 
    
 I was in La Madel. this morning  (Sun) having coffee and juice, and I thought 
 for SURE I was going to see you there!

 I just spoke to my sister and she goes to the doctor on monday.  the baby's 
 heart is the size of a poppy seed, and the baby is the size of a bean.  she 
 and josh are calling it their "beanie baby."  isn't that cute?
 
 
    
 Have a great evening--I'm out of here!

 I know what you mean.  let's figure out when we both have some free time and 
 maybe we can go to a fun dinner and blow off some steam.  
 
 
    
 I think my head spun, then exploded.  Ditto on the busy part!  Trying to get 
 Max and Chloe ready for their departure Friday, meeting with contractors, and 
 work.  OY.
