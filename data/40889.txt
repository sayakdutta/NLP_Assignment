 I have the following comments:
 Credit Data
 I believe the write-up is accurate, but I have cc'd Paul on this memo to confirm.
 
 Financial Trading Risk Data
 We provide aggregate position data for ETS not aggregate VAR, e.g.  ETS is long 10 MMCFD natural gas at Ventura for January 2002, etc. vs. ETS has $1.5 million total VAR.  This is necessary for two reasons: 1.) Enron's VAR does not necessarily equal the sum of its subsidiaries VAR since there may be offsetting positions  throughout the business units.  2.)  Our trading books software (Caminus) does not have the capability to compute VAR in accordance with the specific methodology required (Monte Carlo simulation) in the Enron policy.
 
 Project Analysis Data
 I think this write-up is accurate, but I have cc'd Lisa and Cheryl to confirm.
  
     
 What do you think of this?
 
  
     
 Rod and Joe,
 
 Here is a proposed write up of the procedures we use to protect the data that we send to RAC.
 Please take a look and give me your comments.
 Thanks!
