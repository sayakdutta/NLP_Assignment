 
 I do know Jana.  She has worked in various positions within my group for 
 years since she joined us in the analyst program.  She has not been the 
 strongest player.  Her level of accuracy has not been what we would have 
 liked in many of the roles that she has played for us (confirmations and 
 settlements).  And despite feedback, she is one of those players that just 
 has never quite viewed her performance level in the same light that we see 
 it.  She currently supports trading operations for South America, reporting 
 to Martha Stevens under Scott Mills.  Let me check with Scott on his thoughts 
 about her current performance and on her in an HR role.  I will let you know 
 what he thinks.  It may be to date that we just haven't had Jana in the right 
 role for her.  If I remember correctly, she was originally a teacher who went 
 back to school to get a business degree.  Very sweet, pleasant to work with 
 and personable.  I will get back with you after I have talked with Scott, or 
 I may have him leave you a message.

 Cindy,
 I just wanted to thank you for you time, information, and encouragement 
 yesterday.  Any guidance you can provide on how I should approach a career 
 change to Human Resources is very welcome.
 
 I've attached my resume for your review and consideration.  I look forward to 
 hearing from you soon.
 
 Thanks again,
 Jana Morse x30972
