 We need to move this as fast as possible.

 One of the contract administrators in my group was not able to find the DUNS 
 number you provided in the D&B database online.  I am not sure how quickly 
 updates are made to their database.  Are you aware when this number was 
 issued?  I will put in a request to inquire again at the beginning of next 
 week.  If you have any questions in the meantime, please feel free to give me 
 a call.  Thanks.

 Elizabeth,  The Duns number for Enron Compression Services Company is 
 072773547.   I will be completing the Agency Agreement this afternoon and 
 will forward to you.  Also I faxed the corporate data sheet for the company 
 to you yesterday.  Let me know if you need anything else.  Thanks for your 
 help.
