 
 Attached please find the referenced list.  Some additional comments are as 
 follows:
 
 1.  City of Redding-no change from our previous approvals.
 2.  Cajun Electric Power-no west coast power (caiso or firm).  It can only 
 trade east coast power and Enron can only purchase from Cajun via EOL.
 
 As usual, no European power until further notice.
