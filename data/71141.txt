 
 You know me.  I don't care one way or the other.  Is there a reason why you 
 want to skip it?
 
 We don't have to go to FW for the rodeo.  I just thought that would be fun to 
 do, and my mom wants Michael to come so badly.  We can always just go for a 
 visit.  In fact, Michael and I can go alone some time.  
 
 Like I said last night, you would make a great guide.  You'll be Michael's 
 guide one of these days.

 You do mind if we skip this party?
