 Julia and Richard:
 
 As Julia and I discussed, attached is the information I received from Jim 
 Grove at Haynes & Boone.  He has worked with Lisa Mellencamp and Wade Cline 
 so we should get their input as to how to proceed.  I will let Jim know I 
 have passed along his information, and I assume you will take it from here.  
 Please let me know if there is anything else I can do.

 Teresa - As we discussed, I have attached a brief background summary and a
