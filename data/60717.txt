 
 Hello Pat,
 
 We would like you to price:
 
 Chairs (2) 
 The chairs (476) in 19-502 (Grade 18) with double welt trim as described.
 
 SOFA
 The sofa (6386-80) in 48-137 (Grade 26).
 
 PILLOWS
 3 square additional pillows (2 in chair material and 1 in sofa material).
 
 Would the wood be the same in the sofa as used on the chairs?
 
 Please could you let me know the prices.
 
 Thanks 
 
 Louise Nettelton
