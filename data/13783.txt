 That is fine, just be sure to copy Noel Ryan on the email materials.  I

  I have seen some emails about this recently. I will see what I can find
 out.  It probably will be next week before I can get back to you.
 
 

   
 Kerry,
 
 Has your firm done any legwork on sabbaticals?  We are thinking about
 doing
 a pilot program in EWS for people who have worked here for more than 5-7
 years (to be decided).  Any information, policies, research, pitfalls,
 or
 other experience you or others at the firm may have would be
 appreciated.
 
 If you send stuff by email, please reply to all so that Noel Ryan can
 see
 what you send (since I'll be out of the office on vacation all next
 week).
 
 Thanks a lot!!
 
 Michelle
