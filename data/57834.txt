 Steve, I was wondering if you have any information for me or should I speak 
 with someone else?  Thanks, Karen

 Steve,
 
 Lou's sister, Sue Yang, is a member of the National Women's Political 
 Caucus.  This organization has an annual award called "Good Guys" award, 
 honoring nationally known men who have supported women on women's issues.  
 This year they would like to honor Ken Lay, if he is interested.  Sue does 
 need to know if he supports the equal rights amendment and particularly the 
 pro-choice amendment as her organization is a pro-choice organization.
 
 Sue can be reached at 908-707-0022 if you would like to speak with her.
 
 Please advise on the above.
 
 Karen
