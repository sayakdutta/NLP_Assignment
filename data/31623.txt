 If I don't hear from you by 7:40 PM then I go home.  If I don't hear from you 
 by 8:15 PM then me go to bed (and not with you).
 
 
 
 
 
 

    
 
 
 Soooooooooooo, does that mean you will be coming to the Doubletree after
 your 3/4 mile run and 3 pushups or should I attempt to call you.

 For tomorrow, I believe I'll work out tomorrow after work and I should
 still be back at my desk by 6:30 pm.  Just in case, my pager number is
 877-498-5497.
