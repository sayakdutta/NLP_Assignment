 Just wanted to remind you about our upcoming Board of Directors
 meeting.  The meeting will be held on Saturday, December 8 in Houston.
 Thanks to Paul, we will be meeting at the same location as last time --
 the law offices of Haynes & Boone.  Let's plan to start at 10:30am.
 
 If you have any questions, please let me know.
 
 Take care,
 
 Bobby
