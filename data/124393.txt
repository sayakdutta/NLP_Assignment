 I'll chat with Paul and take care of it.  We have stopped getting access to Dwights outside of the Rockies, so I am looking for production data from other sources.  As soon as I get something reliable, I will update the production maps and get copies to you.

 Do you guys have a map showing the interstate grid for the 1-80 corridor?
