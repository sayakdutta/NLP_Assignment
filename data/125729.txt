 i think something's wrong with mom...she's totally down in the dumps (i've
 called for the last few days now, and every time she seems depressed)
 
 maybe you should give her a casual call, just to say hi and see what's up
 (but don't make it a big deal, or else she'll pretend she's happy and
 everything's okay)
