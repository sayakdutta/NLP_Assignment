 
 Hi Pete,
 
 Here are some comments from GE re confidentiality. Please hang on to the 
 comments pending further direction.
 
 If you are available today for the conference call, it might be helpful for 
 you to listen in for a while.  If you have a conflict, don't worry about it.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
