 
 Please call Bruce Silvers with Bingham & Dana in Hartford, Conn, and tell him 
 my trip has  rescheduled.  Please see if he is available to meet on Monday 
 afternoon, preferably in New York (although I'll confirm later).  I think it 
 might be helpful if Nick Palatin was available as well.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
