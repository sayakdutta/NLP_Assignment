 master.  Wanted to pass on this email from Tanya...

 We may want to rethink allowing P&G to trade on Clickpaper for financial 
 business.  We have been trying to negotiate an ISDA with P&G for well over a 
 year, to no avail.  While they are a great credit, they have issues with our 
 no reliance clause in our documents which is a HUGE legal issue and they were 
 involved in a large derivative lawsuit with Bankers Trust several years ago.  
 This may be one for legal to decide, but my vote is against until there is an 
 ISDA to confirm trades under.
 
 Thanks,
 Tanya
