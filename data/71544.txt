 I have a meeting at EECC which is scheduled from  1130-130, but there is a 
 risk it will run long.  300 would be better.
 
 Thanks for setting this up.

 Herman can meet with us at 2:00 today in his office EB 3394.  Please let me 
 know if this time isa okay with you and I will call him to confirm it.
 
 Thanks.
