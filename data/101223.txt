 
 After reading that did you all of the sudden feel as though your body no 
 longer contained any organs and instead there was just a giant pit where they 
 all used to be?  I never in my life imagined the intense impact an email 
 could have.  They appear so harmless at first glance with no character or 
 personality to the font or page, but upon closer inspection they have the 
 ability to send you soaring or plummet you to the darkest depths.  
 
 I really don't know what to say about the email.  If I didn't know what 
 happened afterward I would have said it was very promising, but knowing what 
 I know I must resort to my new tag line that guys in general are just 
 confused.  I must say though that his quote was outstanding and if Ben and I 
 had any semblance of normal communication between the two of us I would send 
 it to him in a heartbeat.  But we don't so I'll just have to enjoy it solo.  
 
 I fear today will be a very boring day so feel free to keep up an email 
 dialogue throughout the day.
