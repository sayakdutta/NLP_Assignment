 Good morning, Elizabeth.
 
 Sheila asked me to update the Electric Power Primer for the new people on the floor.
 
 Rather than circulate outdated materials, I really need to add the current EEI Form in place of the old Master Purchase and Sale 
 
 Agreement.   May I impose on you for an electronic version of your current EEI agreement?    Also, do you have a presentation 
 
 discussing the EEI highlights?   If so, would you have an objection if we coupled it with the EEI agreement and made the pair 
 
 available to new employees? 
 
 I'm not under an immediate deadline, so please reply at your convenience.
 
 Take care,
 Ed
