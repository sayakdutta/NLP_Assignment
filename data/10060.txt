 	thing in the morning.  Is everyone available at 8:30?  Thanks. Lynn

 John, Please don't kill the messenger, but Lamar Power called along with CMS Marketing today asking that the Scheduled Quantities Report please be reinstated.  This report included receipt and delivery volumes, a summary, as well as, Month to date information. The new report gives them very little to work with and a lot of information they don't need on this report.
 
  
     
 This is currently under discussion but no decision has been made yet, try and work with the customer with the new report.

 FYI - CMS Continental is asking for this report to be re-instated.
