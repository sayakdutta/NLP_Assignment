 
 Shirley,
 
 I shall talk to him on Monday. The chances are he is a complete misfit
 if 2 organizations rejected him.

 Vince:
 
 Maureen asked me to set up an interview with you for a summer intern that has
 been displaced a couple of times, first with EES and then with EBS.  She evidently
 wants him to assist her.  He has some economics in his background.  His name is
 Salah M. Mattoo..
 
 Do you want to do this?   I am afraid we don't have any space for him and if we put
 him somewhere else, he will not be much help to Maureen.
 
 Let me know.

 Shirley,
 
 
 Please, set a meeting with him on Monday.
 
 Shirley, also please set up a meeting with Euford Cooper (Ford).
 His extension is 3-5612.
 Please, explain I did not have time to respond to his msg.
