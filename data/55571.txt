 As Australian Energy Risk 2000 is approaching. I am emailing you with 
 regards  to your presentation. The deadline date is Monday 12 June. If this 
 is going to  be a problem please let me know I will be out of the office from 
 Monday 12,  until Monday 19 June, on which date I will be putting the 
 presentation pack  together to send to the printers. If your presentation is 

 powerpoint file ASAP. 
 
 If you have any problems in doing this please do not hesitate to contact me
