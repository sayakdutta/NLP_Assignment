 Mr.  Kaminski,
 ?
 Nick Perry and I  were recently discussing the conference in Paris, and we 
 gathered that you had  some interest in exploring possible uses of our new 
 WeatherDelta tool-kit.?  It is the only application that we know of, that 
 can?model temperature,  loads, and power prices in several locations 
 simultaneously: thus allowing the  user to measure the value an risk in a 
 variety of financial instruments,  physical obligations and assets.? I have 
 attached the product overview  sheet, and would be happy to discuss its 
 capabilities with you at your  convenience.?? 
 ?
 Nick and I send our  regards, 
 ?
