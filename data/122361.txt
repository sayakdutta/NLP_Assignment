 Will you handle this?  
 
 Thanks, KIm.
 
  
     
 In cleaning up some template information, the following points were found to be on no templates. 
 
 	1. Do they belong on a template?
 	2. Is the template listed the correct one?
 
 Unless I hear differently, I will go ahead and update the templates accordingly.
