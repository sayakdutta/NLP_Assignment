 	of Raetta if Jean is gone?  Does Jean need to have more specific instructions to cover Transok that
 	specifies the timing for putting the allocations in the system?  Thanks. Lynn
 
  
     
 I had reviewed with Jean the procedures for allocating the volumes using the required spreadsheet from Transok.  However, I did not have procedure for the allocation of
 estimated volumes.  Upon requesting the spreadsheet from Transok for the current month, I learned that the spreadsheet would not be available until after our close.  At
 this point, I  found that I was in need of Raetta's help to put in estimates.  To date, I have  received the current month spreadsheet from Transok which will require
 PPAs,

 	Debra, I understand you were covering for Jean Adams while she was on vacation.
 	Did we have the proper coverage to get CMS allocated volumes in GVA reviewed
 	as we needed.  Just wanted to follow up.  I would be glad to visit with you about
 	this if we need.
 
 	Thanks. Lynn
