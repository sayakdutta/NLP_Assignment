 Vince,
 
 I am writing to ask for your help with some research I am doing with John
 Lehoczky and a PhD student.  We trying to apply recent advances in Monte
 Carlo for American options to value Swing and other options with multiple
 early exercise decisions that are important in energy markets.  I know in
 general that early exercise shows up in a wide range of energy contracts,
 both real as welll as financial.  Would it be possible for you, either via
 email or on the phone, to give us some examples of typical terms for such
 instruments?  We would like our examples to look realistic.  We also want to
 make sure we are focusing on the right sorts of optionality.
 
 Thanks in advance,
 Duane
