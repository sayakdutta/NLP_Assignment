 Tana,
 I sent the CDA to our legal team and they had a few changes to make. Can
 you make these changes and send it back?
 
 Regards,
 Dune

 Dune, I've reviewed the NDA and all of their changes are acceptable, except:
 
 --  The additions to the two sentences in Section 1 don't make sense as
 written, so should be restated as follows:
 Any written Confidential Information will be clearly labeled "Confidential
 Information" or, in the absence thereof, will be deemed Confidential
 Information if it is of such nature as should be known to the receiving Party
 to be confidential.  Any Confidential Information transmitted orally will be
 clearly identified as such by the Party disclosing such information at the
 time it is disclosed or, in the absence thereof, will be deemed Confidential
 Information if it is of such nature as should be known to the receiving Party
 to be confidential.
 
 --  We can't agree to the new language in Section 10.
 
 Feel free to forward my comments to Enron if you would like.  I would have
 revised the CDA accordingly, but they use a different redlining system than we
 do.
 
 Thanks.
