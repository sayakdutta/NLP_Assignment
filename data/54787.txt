 PJM is currently experiencing difficulty with the on-line presentation of the
 PJM Manuals.
 
 While we are resolving the problem, an alternate method of reaching the 
 Manuals
 has been created. This alternate has been arranged so that requests from the 
 PJM
 Web Page will automatically use this method. Resultantly, the Adobe Acrobat
 version of the PJM Manuals can still be accessed from the PJM Web Page.
 
 Other methods of reaching the Manuals will not function properly. Please use
 either the PJM Web Page or the following link:
 http://www.pjm.com/manuals2/docs/index.htm.
