 
 Dolores,
 
 I was wondering who my best resource would be to talk to about the changes to 
 the analyst program and how they affect me.  Specifically, I wanted to get 
 some more information on the Third-Year Analyst Rotation and its requirements 
 (as I am currently half-way through my second rotation), as well as the 
 different tracks available within the program.  If you could direct to the 
 proper individual(s) I would really appreciate it.  
 
 Thanks,
 Susan Scott
