 
 This staff meeting is monday at 9:30 in 3AC.
 
  
     
 Something for us to talk about during our next staff meeting.
 
 There are three projects which have significant cash flow problems and thus=
  difficulties in meeting debt obligations: these are: SECLP, Panama and Gaz=
 a.  In the past, as I suppose we have done in Dabhol, we have taken the pos=
 ition that we would not inject cash into these companies and would be prepa=
 red to face a default and possible acceleration of the loans.  SECLP has be=
 en the biggest issue/problem.  Panama is much less (a few million of floati=
 ng of our receivables from the company) would be sufficient to meet the cas=
 h crunch in April of this year.  Note that, in Panama, the debt is fully gu=
 aranteed by the government and is non-recoursed to the operating company, B=
 LM.  In the past, we have discussed letting the debt default, which would c=
 ause the bank to potentially seek complete payment and acceleration from th=
 e GoPanama.  The reason: the vast majority of BLM's problems stem from acti=
 ons taken by the regulator that have effectively amended our PPA's with pri=
 vate parties; those actions resulted in significant loss of revenues, which=
  although today have stopped or have been limited, have left a "mark" on th=
 e company's liquidity position. =20
 
 Now the question is: come April of 2002, should any of our actions in Panam=
 a or decisions related thereto (which we would have otherwise taken or made=
 ) be affected in any way by either the proposed merger or an effort by Enro=
 n to preserve efforts to re-establish investor/creditor confidence?  The sa=
 me could go for SECLP and Gaza.
 
 This is simply an overall "guidance" question.  Let's take it up during our=
  staff meeting next week, if that's ok with you.
 
 Many thanks, Mariella
