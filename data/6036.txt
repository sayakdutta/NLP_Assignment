 Addendum No. 1
 
 To whom it may concern:
 
 It has been brought to my attention that there are some people who are
 interested in playing paintball games.  However, we were going to play this
 weekend but there are a lot of people who are unable to play due to
 previous engagements so we are going to reschedule it for Saturday, January
 20, 2001.  It will cost about $22.00 and that includes admission for the
 whole day, rental of the gun and one Co2 cartridge.  However, paintballs
 are extra and they cost about $6.50 per 100.  If we do end up playing it
 would be recommend to bring a sandwich and drinks because there is not much
 out there.
 
 If you could, please RSVP by Wednesday, January 17, 2001, that way we can
 decide if we have enough people to even play.  Rain or Shine!
 
 Thank you,
 
 George Kissamis
