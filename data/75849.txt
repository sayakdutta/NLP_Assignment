 Attached please find drafts of the following:
 
 Notice
 Assignment and assumption agreement (with GE acknowledgement)
 Bill of sale
 Exhibits for bill of sale and for the notice
 
 I expect that there will be sets of documents for CA Energy Development I and 
 CA Energy Development II.  CA Energy Development II will include a 
 transformer as well as a turbine generator set.
 
 Please let me know if you have any comments.
