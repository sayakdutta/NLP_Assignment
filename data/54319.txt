 Dear Vince,
 
 I am sorry for the dely in answering. These are their phone numbers:
 
 Ernesto Hernandez:  (713) 532-0573
 Carlos Gorrichategui: (713) 668-0408.
 
 The best way to get a hold of them at this point would be through
 me. I would pass along the information and then they can contact you.
 
 Cheers,
 
 Carlos
