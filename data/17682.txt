 
 I'm on vacation next week, but would be happy to get together first thing the 
 following week to discuss. 
 
 Also, in response to a voicemail that I received, wanted to let folks know 
 that the CPUC did not hold gas hearings today. The legislature is, however, 
 holding hearings, taking a "comprehensive view" of the industry (i.e., 
 focusing on specific allegations of pipeline capacity "price gouging").  They 
 held their first hearing today, but it got cut short due to activities 
 underway in the Legislature.  I believe that, prior to cutting the hearing 
 short, the Legislature only made it through two panels of customers, who told 
 stories of skyrocketing bills and associated hardship.  
 
 One panel participant (Anastacio Andrade of Sunrise Mushrooms, I believe) 
 waived an EES bill and described how it tripled between November and 
 December.  I have a feeling that the Legislature's actions may be prompting 
 the PUC to appear that it's doing something.  I'll report more on the 
 Legislative hearings as they occur.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Pardon the pun, but it certainly looks like things are heating up again on 
 the gas front.   Mark, if possible, we'd like for you to be there for TW.  
 Also, Susan or I or both will be there.  I think it'd be a good idea to rally 
 the 'ole "GIR" team by telephone to get our facts straight and understand the 
 issues before this workshop.  We'll be in touch next week.
 
  
     
 In case you weren't on the list.
