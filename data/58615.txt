 10.5 thousand tons?

 In response to your TCV question - it is about $280 million, but
 Macerich does not want the number released publically.  Also,
 below is the final draft which reflects changes from the group.
 We are hoping to release by 9am central time today - Thursday.  
 Still waiting on one person from Macerich.
 
 Thanks!
