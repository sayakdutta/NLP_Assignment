 
 Greetings Diane:
 
 Well, the TeleBears on the Web seems to be experiencing some "technical 
 difficulties" and I've thus far been unable to register.  I'll keep trying!  
 
 In the meantime, I want to make sure that I don't miss any deadlines for the 
 1-unit courses.  I intend to sign up for the E291-B course (Speaking for 
 Management).  When do I need to sign up by?  Thanks.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
