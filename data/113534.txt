 Just a reminder that we are going to have a REAL Closing Party this Thursday to celebrate Enron's short lived (but profitable) existence as a Peaker Plant owner.  Anyone that had anything to do with the Peakers (cradle-to-grave) is invited.  As the original invitation highlighted, the celebration will be held at Farrago's (we have the whole back room), which is located several blocks southwest of Enron at the corner of Gray and Bagby.
 
 The party will start 6:00 pm and go until 10:00 pm (or whenever everyone wants to leave). Attire is casual.    
 
 It should be a lot of fun and a great time for everyone to catch up.  If you haven't already RSVP, please do so to my assistant, Angie Collins (33347)
 
 Se you all Thursday night.
