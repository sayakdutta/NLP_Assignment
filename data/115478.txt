 
 Testing was done in the test database; however, once they released the new 
 version of deal entry into production, they tested one more time to make sure 
 that the new fields were pulling into our scheduling reports. It was a 
 precautionary measure taken so that we wouldn't enter deals all day long only 
 to find out that they wouldn't show up in the Enpower to CAPS report at the 
 end of the day. Sorry for the confusion.

 Hi Kate, 
 
 Can you please let Phil know that he should be testing deals in the enpower 
 test database not the actual system.  
 
 Thanks
 
 
 

 
   
  
 This was just a practice deal entered by Phil yesterday to test our new 
 version of deal entry. He zeroed out the volume, but neglected to kill the 
 deal or at least change it to no confirm. So this is NOT a good deal - I'm 
 killing it now.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate

 Kate can you ask Phil Platter is Dane Energy Corp the correct broker on this 
 deal?
 
 Thanks
