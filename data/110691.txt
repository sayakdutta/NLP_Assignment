 
 Chris,
 
 I met with Phillip yesterday, and he had a few more items to add to his list 
 of objectives for me.  For your information, the attached table provides the 
 additional items.  Please let me know if you have any questions/comments.  
 Also, the following e-mail from Mike Grigsby relates to the Socal sendout 
 model objective.  Also for your information, I will be running Randy Gay's 
 EOL product (Keystone Cash) next week and will be covering for Tori K during 
 her maternity leave.  I don't expect these activities to interfere with my 
 fundy responsibilities.

 Let's have Matt start on the following:
 
 Database for hourly storage activity on Socal.  Begin forecasting hourly and 
 daily activity by backing out receipts, using ISO load actuals and backing 
 out real time imports to get in state gen numbers for gas consumption, and 
 then using temps to estimate core gas load.  Back testing once he gets 
 database created should help him forecast core demand.
 
 Update Socal and PG&E forecast sheets.  Also, break out new gen by EPNG and 
 TW pipelines.
 
 Mike
