 
 Cindy,  Attached is the revised confirm with my changes redlined.  Let me know if this covers Nelson's concerns.
 
  
 
  
     
 Gerald,
 With Judy's departure from our group I have been asked to act as the liaison between the Upstream Desk and Legal. I understand that this is an outstanding issue.
 
 After discussing with Nelson, he would like to include a clause stipulating that the three days is not a result of force majeure.

 FYI...I have been waiting on Nelson to give me feedback. Rod from Mariner is waiting on a confirm.

 Judy,  I added the language for release by Mariner that we discussed.  I put a 3 day threshold in the language.  Please review and lets discuss.
