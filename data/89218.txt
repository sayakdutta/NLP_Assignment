 Debra,
 
 Based on further discussions with the customer, Jill Zivley has negotiated a revised price for the amendment that you recently prepared for the Aspect, Helmerick & Payne, et al. contract. The revised pricing should be 80% of FOM at IF Houston Ship Channel less .075 and 20% of FOM at GD less .065.
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions regarding these changes to the amendment. We need to send this to the customer by tomorrow morning.
 
 Thanks,
 Judy
