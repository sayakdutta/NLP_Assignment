 Hi Mike,
 
 I'm going to use this from you in my story:
 
 "The IT personnel reported into Global Technology, but we did that for
 communication and consistency purposes rather than simply control. They 
 attended
 business unit staff meetings, and the business units gave constant feedback.
 When it came to the review process itself, Global Technology ranked all the
 employees and peers but the business unit had the greatest influence on where
 the person actually ranked and was rated."
 
 If it's OK with you, I'd like to put it in the present tense as I understand
 this is still the case today. I think it might be confusing to readers in the
 past tense, as if it no longer applies. Would that be OK with you? Thanks 
 much.
 
 Regards,
 Gary Anthes
