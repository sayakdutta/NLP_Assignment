 Hi Kathleen, Randy and Chris,
 
 I've made some headway this afternoon.  Juanita gave me info on Alma Roeshot
 so a short article can be inserted.  Joh Scott gave me info on the upcoming
 water board and I'd like to include that article, with your okay, Kathleen.
 
 Still don't know who lives at 509 Narcissus, but Juanita explained all that
 was involved!
 
 Looking forward to a quick response!
 
 Thanks,
 'Nita
