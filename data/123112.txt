 Team,
 
 Late last week, we were asked to provide a fuel oil specification sheet so fuel could be scheduled for the Site at Ft. Pierce.  The issue, currently, is we have three different specifications given to us over the past few months and are unsure which is correct.  The resolution:  we are reviewing the specifications from the air permit and specifications given to us from Mitsubishi to determine the minimum requirements, for the fuel, which we must meet for the air permit and gas turbine generator.  We anticipate this review process to be complete by the middle of this week.  If there are any questions, please feel free to contact me at 68258.
 
 Thank you,
 
 Matthew Tezyk
