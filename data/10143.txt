 Lynn, just wanted to let you know that we'd heard from Jean.  If air travel hasn't been restored, I expect this other "Directing Green" to rent a car and head southeast!

 Jean sent an e-mail reporting they are fine and expect to debark in Vancouver on Saturday.  Hopefully air travel and normalcy (as much as possible) will have been restored by then.  She will keep us posted.
 
 Any questions, please advise--thanks!
