 fall. It makes sensed to coordinate my trip with your unit presentation to
 the MBA students at the UT. Please, let me know who is the person to coordinate this request with?

 Greetings.
 
 Let me once again acknowledge with thanks Enron's generosity in hosting us
 to a baseball game 7/16.  It was only upon reviewing the ticket price at
 home that I recognized just how generous Enron's hosting was.
 
 As we agreed July 16 - 17, I write at this time regarding the first of
 three e-mails.  In this one, I seek your annual participation in the
 Foundations of Energy Finance class at UT.  Subsequent to your
 presentation, your Public Affairs colleagues may choose to schedule a
 reception at which Enron-specific recruting, internship and other
 information may be disseminated.  For this reason, I cc Director of Public
 Affairs Mike Rosen.
 
 You sought a proposal of several alternate dates for your presentation.  I
 am pleased to offer the following as alternative dates:  Sep. 24, Sep. 26,
 Oct. 1, Oct. 8, Oct. 10, Oct. 15 and Oct. 17.  Let me know if your schedule
 requires a wider set of alternatives.  Also, please advise if you would
 like the entire 2 1/2 hr. (2 to 5 p.m., including breaks) time slot, or
 whether you would prefer a subset thereof.
 
 Once we have determined a date, and if a same-day 5 p.m. Enron reception is
 deemed desirable, I ask Mike or his designee to contact my Assist. Energy
