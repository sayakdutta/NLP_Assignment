 
 Davis Minns, Robert McGrory, and Alison Keogh in the Australia Legal Office, 
 and Jane McBride and Yo Yamanishi in the Japan Legal office need full edit 
 access to the Financial Trading Agreement Database in Lotus Notes.  Can you 
 let me know when this has happened.  Can you also get the view capability to 
 the Legal Online Trading Database.  Thanks

 Last week Tana and I discussed geeting the Australian ISDA Masrer Agreements 
 loaded onto the the international data base. I already have access to this 
 data base through Lotus Notes.
 
 The agreed actions were
 
 Tana would arrange for Alison, Rob and myself to have update and view access.
 Tana would work with Alison on getting existing Australian ISDAs loaded up 
 and explaining functionality.
 
 Tana how are we going with access? We can then get things moving.
