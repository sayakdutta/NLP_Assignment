 (and we owe Deutsche Bank for the unwind of the loan swap).  Sara
 
 P.S.  Who will handle credit derivatives in your absence?

 Rod:  attached is a recap of current credit derivatives trading in Jeff K.'s 
 group.  I don't know about activity during Shari's oversight but I hear it 
 was minimal.  How does this compare with Enron Credit.com?  Also, do we want 
 agreements with other trading counterparties (e.g., DLJ Capital Funding, 
 Inc.)?  Are Jeff and Paul calling credit before trading?  Please call to chat 
 when you have a chance.  Thanks.  Sara
