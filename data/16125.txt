 Thanks, Kelli. In my opinion, this ad captures our message very well. Thanks

 IEP Team,
 Attached is a revised January CalJournal ad for your review. Based on
 the group's comments, which were significant, we have developed an
 entirely new ad. However, since the deadline has not changed (art is
 still due today), we need your feedback asap. Please e-mail or call me
 at 916-447-8186 as soon as possible with any comments. If we do not hear
 from you, we will assume you are fine with the ad as is. Thank you for
 all of your help.
 Kelli
