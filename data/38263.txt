 
 I do not have access to this file.   I requested access to the curves directory.  Do I need specific access to the file?
 
 Thanks,
 Mike
 
  
     
 Mike the exact path and name of the Financial Curve File is:
 
 O:\ERMS\1ntra\CURVES\GDI - West II.xls
 
 It would be better for us if you would set the financial index curves in this file, just like you do the Physical index curves in the other file.  Let me know what you decide.
 
 Thanks
