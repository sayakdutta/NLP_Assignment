 In your FAQ, you might like to outline the contract structure in some detail, 
 for eg:
 
 * the counterparty contracts with Enron North America re: PA
 * contracts with ENA re: ETA and 
 * contracts with Singapore re: GTC
 
 Was there any particular reason that you chose the PA to be with ENA rather 
 than Enron Japan.  Note, Australia was done for the Australian market.
 
 I would prefer to change it to Enron Japan. Will we have to receive further 
 external advice? If not, I will change it accordingly.
