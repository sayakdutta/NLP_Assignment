 Welcome to the Legal Dept.!  I think Taffy was coordinating with you 
 regarding my dinner with Mark this week,  Unfortunately, my trip was canceled 
 at the very last minute this afternoon.  Mark is already aware of the change 
 but he may now have an open slot for dinner on Wed.  
 
 I'm sorry I won't be able to meet you this week but will look forward to it 
 on my next trip over.
 
 Mark

 Hello Mark
 
 Just to let you know, I have replaced Meagan, she has moved on to another 
 department.
 Mark would like to meet you for dinner on either Monday or Wednesday night 
 next week.
 I am doing his itenerary and would appreciate it if you could e-mail me and 
 let me know what suits you.  I am of course assuming that you will be in 
 London next week.
 
 Thanks
 Fiona
