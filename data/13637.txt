In principle, I have no issue with Enron indemnifying Accenture for intellectual property litigation relating to content ownership.  On the logo issue, I would have to defer to you and the PR/branding folks.

 Mark, a few issues have risen in the Accenture Arrangement Letter I'm
 working on with Yevgeny.
 
 Background.  Accenture is going to create video and other content for a
 training module for Enron.   Part of the deal is that Enron is suppose to
 license the training module to Accenture for Accenture's internal training.
 The issues are this:
 
 1.  Accenture has now asked for a warranty and indemnity regarding ownership
 of the content by Enron.  What, if any, warranty or indemnity will Enron
 give regarding the content.  (Initially, I drafted that Enron will not give
 any warranties or indemnities, but Accenture is now asking for them.)
 
 2.  Due to the content, Enron employees and Enron names and logos will be
 displayed.  Accenture wants to display the content to its employees and in
 another agreement display the content to third parties.  Whose approval does
 Yevgeny need to allow such use of the content?
 
 Please advise on Enron's position.
