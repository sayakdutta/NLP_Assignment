 
 I don't see any serious problems with this.  There are a few things you two 
 need to verify or get comfortable with:  bullet 6 says PG&E has made all 
 payments in a timely manner.  You can leave it in if its true, but the bullet 
 needs to be mutual, not one-way, and I'd suggest replacing it with: 
 "Transwestern and PG&E agree that, by entering into this agreement, neither 
 is to be deemed to have made any admission against interest."  Also, the 
 mechanism in bullet 9 is up to you, Paul.  We should probably list the rating 
 service by name to avoid ambiguity.  There are also a couple of minor 
 things:  in bullet 2, add an "s" to "contract" inline 2; in bullet 7, add 
 "the" at the end of line 1.  Call if you have questions.  DF
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
   
  
  I have received the comments from PG & E. They are in a red lined version in 
 the attached file below.
 
  Please review and let's discuss.
 
  Thanks.
