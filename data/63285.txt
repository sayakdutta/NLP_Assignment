 During our previous executive forums, interest was expressed in holding a 
 forum in London for executives who have participated in the Executive Program 
 and are based in the UK.  Mary Clark indicates that you will be in London the 
 end of this month for an employee meeting.  Following are the names of the 
 Enron Europe executives who have participated in the Executive Program to 
 date:
 
 Kevin Beasley
 Eric Gadd
 Eric Gonzales
 Matthew Scrimshaw
 Brian Stanley
 Steve Young
 Gregory Cardenas
 
 They will be receiving invitations to the Executive Forums scheduled here in 
 Houston over the next few months.  But, I would be happy to invite them to a 
 special Executive Forum, specifically for them, in London while you are 
 there, your schedules permitting.  Please let me know if you would like me to 
 try to arrange this.
