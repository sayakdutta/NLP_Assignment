 
 I like those kinds of schedules!
 
 
     
 
 That is what I love about you that you will do just about anything three or four times! 
 
 I love you so much and thanks for the nookie this morning.  You know all my health books say that it is really good to have sex/orgasms twice a week during the cold/flu season because it helps to strengthen the immune system.  This sounds dorky but maybe we should set lovemaking dates everyweek and just stick to it! 
 
 Love and Kisses
