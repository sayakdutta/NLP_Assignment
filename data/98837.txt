 whether Fla law is good or not. Sorry.

 I am reviewing a contract for testing turbines with a small municipality in 
 Florida, under which the muni would allow us to periodically test turbines at 
 its facilities.  They want Florida law to govern, and I don't anticipate that 
 they will move on this.  They also want Palm Beach County as the venue for 
 arbitration.  I am going to push for a large city to ensure a decent pool of 
 arbitrators.  What is your view of Miami as the venue for arbitration?
