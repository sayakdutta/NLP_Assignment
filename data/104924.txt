 Sara:
 
 I just spoke with Rolo and he advised the ownership structure of 
 Transportadora de Gas del Sur S.A. (TGS):
 
 70% of TGS is owned by Compania de Inversiones de Energia S.A. (CIESA)
 CIESA is owned 50% by Enron and 50% by Perez Companc.
 In the corporate workbook the ownership structure of CIESA is outlined.  
 
 The ownership structure of CIESA is somewhat complex and it appears that 
 Enron Pipeline Company-Argentina S.A. is the legal entity that owns the 
 shares in CIESA.  
 
 I am assuming the best way to structure the event of default is to say if 
 Enron Corp. through its wholly-owned subsidiaries no longer owns 50% of CIESA 
 and/or if CIESA no longer owns 70% of TGS then, a Change in Ownership Event 
 of Default will have occurred.
 
 Please let me know what you think of this.
 
 Regards,
 
 Pat

 Pat,
 
 Yetserday we had a meeting with TGS. We agreed to put an MSA in place to 
 start hedging LPG. They are very interested in doing business with us, so I 
 suggest we go ahead preparing the MSA.
 Do you need TGS financial's or you already have them? Do you need anything 
 else?
 
 Regards,
 
 Rolo
