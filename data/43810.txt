 What a meltdown.  As for me, I'm the new boy - creating a new job.  Not
 sure what my needs will be, but I'd say probably 3-6 months, close a
 deal before my domain expands.  Do you know Jessica Landis?  or Jim
 Easter?  they're both here and could probably be of more assistance.
 
 take care - good luck - hope you sold all at$75 or above!
