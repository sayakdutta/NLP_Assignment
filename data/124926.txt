 Kate,
 EPE will be lending us a schedule for Tuesday, 25 mws at $4 at PV. The schedule will be on peak.  Similar to today.  Please work with the preschedulers to get the sheet correct (Friday's sheet for Monday had a duplicate 10 mw schedule in it).
 Let me know if you have questions.
 Thanks,
 Bill
