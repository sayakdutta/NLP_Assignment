 Attached is the proposed language for a letter explaining the reasons to 
 postpone the securitization deal.  Larry Lawyer would like to send this 
 letter to the investment banks, potential investors, rating agencies and the 
 deal team.  
 
 Please review the statement and give me a call at X33242 with any comments or 
 changes.  
 
 I have also attached the final draft of the Q&A.  I appreciated all the help 
 from the legal department on this document.  Shari and Janet had several 
 comments that I think will be very helpful.
 
 Thanks again
 
 Traci
