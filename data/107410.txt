 Dear Sara: please kindly forward your response to my email of 15 March which
 attached the "marked-up" Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement. Your prompt
 response would be greatly appreciated as our credit department is extremely
 keen that these agreements are executed immediately.
 I thank you in advance for your cooperation.
 Kind regards
 Anita
