 I need a phone number.  I lost all my information last week in a disk drive
 failure.

    OU tix are in!
 
    We'll work out leaving the tix for you under the mat, unless you'd like
    me
    to fedex them to you.  Let me know

    It looks like we won't make it to Austin before the 1st.  I'll probably
    just ask you to leave the tix under your front door matt on the day of
    the
    NMSU game and we will stop by to pick them up.  I will verify this with
    you
    next week.  I can't believe the season is already upon us.  Any word on
    OU?
 
    Thanks

       Sorry I misspelled your name again.  Just let me know when.  They'll
    be
       here

       I may be in Austin later this summer.  I'm in no hurry to get the
       tickets.
       If you will, please hang on to them and I'll advise at a later date.
       Thanks.

          Darin - The season tickets are in; OU tickets will be mailed
    later.
       How
          do
          you want to pick them up?  Any plans to be in Austin, soon?
 
          Regards
