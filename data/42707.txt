 The approach you have outlined is fine with me.
 
 Thanks,

 We have been asked to provide an electricity contract form on a rush for 
 Walmart.  Have talked with Mike Smith and we plan to use the Master Electric 
 form that Mike is revising and plans to send to business team tonite.   The 
 deal for Walmart is electricity only in CA right now, but will probably 
 expand to other states later.   Angela Schwarz wants to have the form of 
 contract agreed to and ready prior to having the transaction/price terms 
 agreed to.  Jeff,   I plan to take Mike's latest version of the form tomorrow 
 and revise that (including incorporating some of Walmart's comments on the 
 gas deal that Marianne Castano was working on separately) and get it out for 
 review by you, Mike and the business team, and will hope that we can get the 
 draft form to Walmart in the next 2-3 days.   If y'all want to meet about 
 Walmart we can, otherwise I'll plan to do this via phone and email.  Thanks,

 I have been asked to work on a Walmart commodity deal covering several 
 different states, not sure which ones yet.   Marianne Castano worked on a gas 
 deal with them and otherwise we have no current business with them.   I plan 
 to use the new Master Electric form that we have been working with ENA and 
 the business team on.  Am coordinating with Mike Smith.  Jeff, when I have a 
 draft ready I'll send it to you, probably toward the end of this week, I 
 don't have pricing yet.  M3
