 Howdy everyone!
 
 Rebecca, myself and the pumpkin will be gracing the Great State of Texas in
 late Feb.  During this time, we will be hosting a post wedding reception on
 Sunday the 24th. of February, 2002 at the Coliseum Restaurant in Clear Lake.
   We plan on starting the party at around 1300.  It will be a semi formal
 type of occasion, so just bring an appetite and get ready for a great
 afternoon!
 
 If you could please let us know via email if you can make it and if you will
 be bringing a significant other, we would greatly appreciate it.
 
 We look forward to seeing everyone there!
 
 Tommy
 GO STELLERS!!!!!!
