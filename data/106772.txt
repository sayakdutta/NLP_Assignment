 
 Sorry to keep sending emails BUT my assistant just walked in and said that 
 you were expecting a presentation by Mark Taylor on the phone call.  To my 
 knowledge, Mark doesn't know anything about this call (your email of 1/17 
 doesn't mention Mark).  So, I'm totally confused.  If we are going to discuss 
 the term sheet process and related tax issues, let's do it.  If you want to 
 cancel because you are expecting something different, please let me know (and 
 advise Lynn and Julian).  Thanks.
