 Sara: As requested, attached is the English translation of the 10-year PPA 
 that Enron Comercializadora entered into with Moema. The Agreement is signed, 
 and Moema is supposed to start delivery in May 2000. However, performance by 
 both parties is subject to Moema requesting and obtaining from ANEEL the 
 status of independent producer. I don't know who else should get a copy of 
 this agreement. I am assuming that credit has been already involved.
