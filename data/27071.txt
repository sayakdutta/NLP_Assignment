 You have been somehow  entering deals under South America - Brazil region,   rather than South 2001.   Risk has been having a problem with this.
 This has also affected the Brazil trading desk.      
 Double check your deal entry desks and zones.     I intended to mention this last week and I forgot.   It came up again today,  per risk.
 
 Also,
 on the hour ending 6 deal today;   you should have entered a sale to Frontera in Enpower, rather than Mirant.
 This is a bit confusing,  but here goes:
 
 Frontera had sold Mirant this option,  not Enron.     Frontera tells me daily what Mirant is calling for.   I replace this power,  or Frontera generates the schedule.
 If I (or you)  replace,  then we do enter a schedule of a sale to Mirant in the Portal.   But,  we dont sell to Mirant in Enpower, as this is not our deal.
 
 Instead,   the sale goes to Frontera.   They pay us to reimburse us for buying LCRA on their behalf. 
 
 Does that help?
