 Kevin / Michelle:
 
 As I get ready for this mediation, I thought that these various presentations to ECT senior management (McConnell, Pres. of HPL, Rice and Hannon) would be helpful.  Special attention to the Hannon presentation which clearly shows that the real benefits of this new company were NOT primarily related to the monetization of the equipment (which Bill Rome contends), but instead were related to new business earnings and substantial cost savings.  This also has proved itself out as we go forward.
