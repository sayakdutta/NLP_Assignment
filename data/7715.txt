 there!  I am that you continue to be pleased with your decision to come to 
 Enron, and I am  certainly glad that you are here.    
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
    
 I just wanted to say thanks for the Astros tickets.  My wife and I enjoyed 
 seeing the ballpark and watching the game.  I am really enjoying my work here 
 at Enron and am excited about the challenges ahead.  When someone asks me if 
 I think I made the right decision to come to Enron, I say yes without 
 hesitation.  Thanks again for the tickets, as well as all your support.
