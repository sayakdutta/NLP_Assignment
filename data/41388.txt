 
 In connection with Tana Jones' e-mail of July 12, 2001, I am attaching revised forms of the Credit Confidentiality Agreements for use in requesting financial statements from a counterparty.  Please begin using the attached forms when preparing confidentiality agreements and please refer to Tana's e-mail regarding procedures for preparing and signing the agreements.
 
 If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me at x33907.
