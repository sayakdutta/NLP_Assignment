 Michelle,
 
 Thanks for the quick response on this contract.  I made your suggested changes and deleted the paragraph about the confidentiality.   I spoke to the other Networks generalist who has night shift clients.  He stated that all night shift individuals receive the same premium and there's no reason to keep the matter confidential.  In fact, it is a selling point to attract night shift talent.  Thanks for commenting on the language.
 
 Please let me know if I may proceed with signatures.
