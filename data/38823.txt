 you are to close with them to actually move.  I wish you luck and hopefully 
 you get a good offer but i would definetly think about needing more than just 
 $35,000 to live in LA. I would think the absolute minimum you should take 
 would be $40,000 to $45,000 plus moving costs and siging bonus.  He has been 
 persuing you for over a year so it appears he is pretty desperate for you 
 services.  In LA to get someone for that cheap is really a bargain.  You have 
 got to realize it s really expensive to live there.  Especially if your 
 office is in Beverly Hills.  You kind of have two options.  You could live in 
 the Valley for cheaper.  But in my opinion the Valley sucks. I would never 
 ever ever live in the valley.   Or you could find somewhere in like North 
 Hollywood or maybe Redondo Beach.  Lisa lives there (north Hollywood)  and 
 pays about $900 a month for a one bedroom apartment.  Which is very 
 reasonable for LA.  Maybe Danny has some connections.   So I am curious, if 
 Dave was to say I love you and don't go would you stay?
