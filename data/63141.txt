 The attached spreadsheet outlines the remaining income (assuming no further 
 recovery) to be recorded on Blue Range.  There is an issue regarding the 
 foreign exchange on the Houston reserve as detailed on this spreadsheet.  
 Canada's position is that this is a Canadian dollar denominated transaction 
 and we should be kept whole on the Canadian dollars.  Please review, Wanda, 
 and let me know if you have any questions.
