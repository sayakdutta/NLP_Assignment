 Shirley,
 
 For some reason Vince's e-mail address bounced!  Could you please forward this e-mail to him?  Thank you.

 Gentlemen,
 
 Just a reminder that I need to collect your pledges by 5/15/2001.  You can either pay cash or write a check to National Multiple Sclerosis Society.  Please let me know when I can come by and collect.  Once again MS society and I would like to thank you for supporting this worthy cause.
