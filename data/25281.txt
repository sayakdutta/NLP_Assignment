 
 Due to the lack of space for the Sitara training, only 4 people can attend 
 from Texas.  I think that it would be most beneficial if the newest members 
 of the group attended this first meeting (Liz, Mary, Susan, and Sabrae).  
 Russ will set up another session at a future date for others (Tom, Eddie, 
 Mark).
 
 Let me know if you have any questions.

 The number of interested people turned out to be larger than the room can 
 handle.  Can you just send 3 or 4 for this meeting and I will set up a 
 secondary date for the others.
 
 Thanks

 I will be giving a training session on Wed   9/13/00  in 21C2 from 3:00-4:30 
 pm.
 I would like for you to send to the class any new logistics personnel that 
 you might think could use a Sitara overview.
 If someone cannot make it at this time, let me know their names and I will 
 try to schedule something for them at a later time.
 
 If possible, please send me a note on who might be attending, so I can get an 
 approximate head count.
 
 Call me or e-mail me if you have any questions
