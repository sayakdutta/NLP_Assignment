 thanks
 
 
 
 

 
   
  
 Looks like Tom forgot this deal on Friday - I've just entered it. Deal # is 
 514006. One thing I didn't check on was whether it was off-peak or on-peak. 
 Does this deal check out with APB? Let me know.
 
 Thanks,

 I don't see any deals with any of these terms in Tom's trade log for today. 
 He's left the office, and I've left him a message on his cell phone - but 
 until then, I can't really say if this is good or not. Could it be a Mark 
 Fischer deal?
