 Hmmmm...I sent it out a few hours ago.? Didn't you receive it ? 
 
  
     
 I know that you've already indicated that you will circulate a draft of the 
 late-filed exhibit by Friday, but if you have a draft we could look at 
 sooner, that would be great...TW's business people who need to look at it 
 will be out at the beginning of next week.? Thanks.
