 I managed to contact Sean this morning.  He also confirmed dinner at 
 Brennan's.  He didn't really have a reason for waiting except to see what 
 other offers came in.  He's shopping us.  He did say he was leaning toward 
 Enron, though.  I answered some questions he had concerning what his day to 
 day duties might consist of and how much input he would have in his summer 
 placement.  I also suggested he get in touch with Morela and talk to her 
 about her summer experience.

 I spoke with Philip today and he is confirmed for dinner at Brennan's.  He is 
 holding back on commiting to Enron mainly to preserve his geographic 
 options.  He indicated that Enron was definitely his first choice but for 
 some personal considerations.  I think Philip was our strongest candidate and 
 I would hate to lose him for these personal reasons.  I have an idea about 
 how to 'fix' it and will pursue a solution and let you know.
