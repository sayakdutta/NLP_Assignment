 I think it would be helpful from a legal and environmental standpoint so that 
 everyone might better understand our resonsibilities and obligations. Thanks. 
 Audrey can set the meeting up for you.

 Do you see any benefit for some of us (maybe Mike Terraso, Larry Campbell and 
 I - or some combination thereof) setting up a briefing session for you and 
 your staff on PCBs.  We could provide some general information and well as 
 Transwestern specific information/history that might make your group better 
 equipped to discuss matters with some of our customers - particularly PG&E 
 (although Jeff and Lorraine has been a quick study already). Based on Rod 
 Boschee's last email they may be looking for us to replace their line 300 
 before they entertain any increased flows.
 
 Thgts?
