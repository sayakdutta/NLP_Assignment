 Let's shoot for Thursday at 10:00.  Felicia, please set up a conference room 
 for then.
 
 Mark/Ross, let me know if that time doesn't work for you.

 I'm scheduled to be here.  Tomorrow and Wednesday are pretty bad, but 
 Thursday and Friday are wide open.

 Are you in the office this week?  I'm interested in getting together to 
 discuss Westinghouse.
