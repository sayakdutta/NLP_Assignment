 other stuff as well.  Kinda like on the turbine stuff - each counterparty has 
 wanted something different.

 A letter whereby a party agrees that in the event of a change of control of 
 its counterparty, it will not use such change of control event as a basis for 
 challenging the enforceability of the agreement that it has with the 
 counterparty.  At least in our context this is what Fred means by estoppel 
 letter.  He has a very good point that we should incorporate this concept 
 into our further assurances clause in our option agreements.
