 I think the entire event was outstanding.  I also enjoyed it but my hand 
 still hurts!  Ken went through it today at the executive committee and he 
 talked about the incredible potential and the job you were doing.
 Congratulations again,
 mike
 
 PS Weekly calls are a favorite of mine as you know.

 Mike,
 
 Certainly appreciate you visiting the office and helping with the opening... 
 not the least shaking over 300 hands and breaking the barrell.  Sorry we were 
 not able to spend some time discussing business.  We did get some good time 
 with Jeff on Wednesday.  I understand we will now be on a weekly call.
 
 Ken seemed to be satisfied with the opening.  His visit has done quite a lot 
 for us.
 
 thanks,
 Joe
