 
 FYI.  Suggested addressing it to Angelides, but they didn't want to "dignify" his letter.  They decided that, ultimately, Loretta's in charge, and addressed it to her.  Had a great talk with Sarah.  She's following up on a few things.  You may want to touch base with her re: hearings on DWR rev. req.  You ever received my (modest) edits to the Karl Wood letter?
 
 Best,
 Jeff
 
 PS Is that article you sent me re: bad contracts from today's papers?

 Attached is a final version of the letter faxed today to Loretta Lynch.
 Please call or write if you'd like a faxed copy with the signatures. 
 (And
 lemme know your fax number.)  If this letter needs to be distributed to
 some service list, I will assume an attorney-at-law will perform that
 duty.
