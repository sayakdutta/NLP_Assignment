 
 I've got Mike Swerzbin checking on this deal. He says Holli Krebs actually 
 did the deal, so he's trying to get a hold of her right now to verify the 
 term. I'll let you know as soon as I find out.
 
 Thanks,

 When I tried to verbally confirm this deal, the counterparty has this deal 
 running for three months, December through February.  Could you check with 
 the trader and either change it or have him talk to the counterparty about 
 it.  Let me know.
 
 Thanks!
