 
 Greetings:
 Unfortunately, I'll be in Mexico getting the Mexican version of hoof and 
 mouth.  Bummer.  Of course, the highlight of the semester for me was seeing 
 Ms Deepika at Squaw last weekend.  We should commit to a ski trip next year. 
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 How about...I'll be in London?  Seriously!  It never
 fails!  Must be karma-something!  No spring break and
 no b-day celebrations for me...just hoof and mouth
 disease.  I'll miss you all...who's birthday's are
 next?  I'll just have to save my celebrations up, I
 guess.  
 Always something, 
 Courtney
