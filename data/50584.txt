 Hi Christie,
 
 when do you sleep? 2 am, ugh!
 
 ok,  you were correct, my invitation was to those people within Enron that 
 the students talked with before interviewing competitors, and it was an 
 invitation to the presentation only.  I didn't think any of them would be 
 invited to the dinner, and probably none will even come to the presentation.  
 The invitation did elicit one request for the final report though, so maybe 
 it wasn't a complete waste.  
 
 I didn't realize that the dinner had turned into a box visit.  that sounds 
 great.  I wish the group could have made it to dinner before the first game, 
 that would have made the whole slumming experience better.  Now they'll get 
 the royal treatment at Enron Field.  It'll be great.
 
 Vince invited 4 people from Rice:
 




 
 Loughridge wrote back saying he'll come, I don't know about the others
 
 Here are the 6 students emails:
 




 
 your 2 from Rice makes a total of 12 from Rice, I guess
 
 let me know if you would like me to do anything else related to Monday
 look forward to seeing you then
