 Cake was good.  Will start prep for the shower on sunday evening after the baptism.  I am baking 2 cakes for a total of 30 people....a little stressfull, but should be fun.
 Talk to you later.
 
 
 
 

    
 
 How did the cakes turn out on Sunday?  David and I are going to take Granny
 to the doctor at 3:00 today.
 
 What is your official title at Enron?  I need it for the Change of Command
 ceremony program.
