 
 We absolutely should do this.
 
 We shouldn't necessarily not get paid.
 
 There are many different type of outsourcing structures that we have used.
 
 PetroCanada/Suncor - Milnthorp
 
 Brooklyn Union
 
 Peoples - Laura Luce
 
 Enerconnect - Devries
 
 My experience have been only positive when we have been able to get very close with a customer.  Money will show up.  However, if we do operations/accounting stuff for them we should get paid.

 Louisiana Pacific has sent me a letter requesting that John Malowney cover all of their energy needs in North America.  John has done an excellent job building this customer relationship to the point that they want to bring him into their energy management team.  This would include both gas and power, I think throughout North America.  I have never received a request like this and am not sure how to handle it.  John would like to do this, and would be willing to take the risk on committing extra time to LP in hopes of more deal flow.  Since this relationship would be broader than just West Power, I am looking for direction from you whether and how we should proceed internally.  Part of me says that it will be a big headache and time sink for which we will never get paid.  The other part of me says that this is exactly where we want to be with our customers and if they want John to represent them, then Enron needs to find a way to make it happen.  Let me know your thoughts.
