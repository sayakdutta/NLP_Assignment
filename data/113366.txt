 t let's make sure that we have outlined our "needs" and "wants" and "no way=

 uessing most of the parties in town)?

 I would say, no downside to supporting implementation of Settlement proceed=
 ings.  As one of the customers replied yesterday afternoon: "Count Phelps D=
 odge Corporation "in" for settlement conferences - possible certainty throu=
 gh settlement is preferable to several years of litigation."  I'd bet that =
 FERC would be thrilled to see a settlement proposal, even one that was cont=
 ested, given - as you say - that they are swamped with other issues.  With =
 no settlement, any decision they issue that disadvantages one segment is su=
 re to be litigated.  At least with a settlement, they stand a chance of get=
 ting something out of the process even though they might not get everything=
  they want.
 
 Feedback from Janie, presumably cleared by the Desk:  "I am deferring this =
 to you but I don't see any reason we would have any problem with this  eith=
 er."

 What's the upside and downside from the Settlement.  My only concern is tha=
 t FERC is so swamped with issues may be overwhelming.  Where is our busines=

 support for the motion IN NO WAY reflects any agreement to support any

 whether your company would like to be listed.  We intend to file on
 Wednesday early afternoon.  Thank you.
