 FYI.  Ignore the Enron Guaranty but make sure that the PSE&G Guaranty that 
 you eventually get conforms to this.

 Maria:
 I think that 2 minor chnages need to be made to the Enron Guaranty and
 probably
 the PSE&G Guaranty:
 
 1.   Change in the first paragraph "Enron North America Corp., a Delaware
 corporation to Enron North America Corp., a Delaware corporation and its
 successors and assigns
 
 2.   In the definition of "Agreement" include language that would pick up
 amendments, supplements, replacements and restatements thereof so its reads
 :"such ISDA Master Agreement, together with each Confirmation exchanged
 between
 the parties thereto and together with any and all amendments, supplements,
 replacements and restatements thereof, hereinafter the "Agreement")
 
 Let me know if you have a problem with this.
