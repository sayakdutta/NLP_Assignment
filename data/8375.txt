 Sally,
 FYI -- 
 Last week, I submitted my resume to Molly Magee for the Director of Global Courterparty position that James Scribner has open within the Energy Operations Global Services Management organization.
 It has been a desire of mine for sometime to be a part of your organization, and I look forward to being considered for this or other positions.
 Best regards,
 Sarabeth Smith
