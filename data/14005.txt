 Attached is the proposed Consulting Services Agreement incorporating changes as we discussed.  In particular, I have modified the following paragraphs:    (1), (3), (3.b), (3.d), (3.e), (13) and (14.c). 
 
 Once you and Michelle have had an opportunity to review this revised Consulting Services Agreement, please contact me to discuss the changes.
