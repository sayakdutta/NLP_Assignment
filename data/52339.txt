 The course is designed to fit the background of a typical MBA
 student. I don't  see a major problem with the pre-reqs.

 Vincent,
 I am a student of Rice EMBA 2002 program. I see you are offering Energy Derivatives course (MGMT-656) next spring. I am very interested to register for this course. However, considering the pre-reqs, I am not sure whether I will be eligible to do
 that? EMBA course numbers are different from the regular MBA course numbers. Are you you looking for any specific skill or knowledge a student must have to register for this course? If I am not eligible, can I audit this course.
 Best Regards,
 Asis
