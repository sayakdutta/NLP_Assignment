 Joe, what is your phone number.
 
 The job that you & I in the past have talked about is the same one you and Jeremy discussed.     We have been talking about hiring a gulf coast/midcontiinet physical trader--  with both physical and financial experience.    Call me next week or give me your number and we can talk.
 
 thank yo*--  have a great easter.
 
 

 Hey, thought I would send you an email to say hello. I know how bid week can be. I spoke with Jeremy the other day and forwarded my resume  to him. I am not sure what he is look for, but I would definitely like the opportunity to speak with him. Hopefully I will hear something  after the holiday weekend. Have a happy Easter and I will catch up later.
 
 Thanks
 Joe
