 
 You're right - bankruptcy is a likely move for PG&E. But this deal was 
 entered in place of an existing position we had with PG&E in the California 
 Power Exchange, and it's been approved by our legal and credit departments.
 
 Let me know if you have further questions.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
   
  
 This deal is with PG&E.  I thought they were going into bankruptcy.  Can you 
 check and see if this is a wrong co name or what.
 
 Thanks!
