 Vince, congratulations on your promotion.  Hope the litigation lawyers are 
 leaving you alone.
 
 I'm attaching a resume of a friend of mine, Cameron Payne.  I don't know if 
 you are looking for anyone but Cameron is pretty special, as you'll see from 
 his resume.   Call him or me if you're interested in talking to him.  I'm 
 forwarding his resume to Fastow and Whalley, too, in case they see a fit.  
 Take care.  Bob
