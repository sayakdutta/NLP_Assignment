 No problem.  Come see us when you want it done.
 
  
     
 Laura,
 
 I don't know if you have heard but I am moving back to Calgary to trade gas. I am coming back in mid-september. Would you do a USD/CND currency swap for me when I get back? I would like to avoid the Royal Bank's huge bid / offer spread. Let me know. 
 
 Thanx
 
 Chris
