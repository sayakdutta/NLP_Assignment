 
 Attached is the file with the appropriate liquidations that should match the 
 transport expense variance.  We are within a few thousands dollars of the 
 variance using these calculated liquidation amounts.  They are all physical 
 annuities in the FT-Ont-Central book.  I am getting the post ids unarchived 
 to verify that they were in the flash financial liquidations.  Please tell me 
 if you have these in the FT file, I have already checked Jim's intra physical 
 and financial files for Ontario and came up empty.  My thinking(hoping) on 
 this issue is that  the liquidations will be flashed and not captured in the 
 GL.  Give me a shout with any questions.
