 Richard here is what I have--there is an update in progress, but nothing substantive for your purposes.  You have the ESA risk matrix which has the major cases you may want to reveal.  Please let me know if there is anything else I can help you with.  I have my cell phone 713-899-6300, or Stephanie has the number to this conference room.  Do you have any good news?  John Gardiner is here from NYC and keeps reminding me "we are all still standing."
