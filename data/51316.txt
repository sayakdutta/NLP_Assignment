 
 Jason,
 
 There was a problem with the request. I could not approve it (the system would
 not let me do it). There must have been a  mistake in the way it was 
 submitted).
 Please, ask Shirley to resubmit.

 Vince,
 
 A few weeks ago we talked about installing an additional Bloomberg terminal 
 on the 31st floor for Mike's weather team.
  I have submitted a security request, and we are now waiting for your 
 approval.  
 Could you, please, go over that request and give Mike Roberts and me your 
 feedback?
