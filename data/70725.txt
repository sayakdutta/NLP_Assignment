 
 I believe the payment schedule on the spread sheet previously given to AK is 
 correct.  If there is a conflict, change order 4 takes precedence as to the 
 timing of the payments.  At least 10% has been paid on these turbines, so I 
 don't understand the 5% question.
 
 Rebecca Walker is preparing an updated payment schedule for all the break out 
 contracts.

 Pete Thompson called with a question about what payments have been made on 
 the Las Vegas turbines.  He made specific reference to Change Order #4 and 
 the effect it may have on the payment schedule for Las Vegas.
 
 Do you know whether a 5% payment was made on these 4 turbines, or will the 
 full payment amount be due on May 15, Julsy 30 and August 30?
