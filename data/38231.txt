I do not believe Elizabeth Shim is there employee to rank for termination.  Until last week, Elizabeth Shim was in the Trading Track program on loan to Bob Hall and logistics.  If they were trying to meet quota by terminating Elizabeth, then I think they need to look elsewhere.  The Trading group should be making the decision on whether or not we fire Trading Track employees.  We just put Elizabeth on a performance plan and ranked her in the Associate/Analyst PRC on Monday.  
 
 Let me know,
