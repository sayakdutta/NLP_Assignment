 As you are aware, I reviewed the proposed Canadian Power Master and have been 
 speaking to Greg Johnston about various issues.  The Canadian Master is based 
 upon EEI but has been "retyped" making changes based upon variations in the 
 way US power has evolved from that of the Canadian master gas contract (the 
 basis for a number of the differences from EEI) , operational distinctions, 
 differences in product and jurisdictional issues.  EEI has called me and 
 stated that they want to attend a meeting on November 9th  in Ontario to 
 advocate the use of the EEI form in Canada.   Peter Keohane, I know, wants 
 the form he and Greg prepared to be the model Canadian form for all the 
 reasons he stated in his email to you.  Do you think I should set up a 
 meeting with you, Jeff Hodge, Peter K., Greg J. and myself to discuss.  At 
 that time, we could also discuss the significant "policy differences" to make 
 sure that everybody knows what is going on and that there are good reasons 
 for the differences.
 
 Thanks
