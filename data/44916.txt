 
 Attached are the referenced lists.  On the 6/19/00 list for Sithe Power 
 Marketing, LP, they were on the original approval list, and since they are 
 coming through again for SO2, and since I'm not sure if we had SO2 on the 
 original list, I open them up for it just in case.  Also, I opened them up 
 for financial, since it appears they have now met the eligible swap 
 participant requirements, even tho' Credit is still not opening them up for 
 financial.
