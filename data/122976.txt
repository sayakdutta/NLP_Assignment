 It's That Time Again!
 

 
 This memo is a reminder to log onto eHRonline and complete your timesheet.
 
 Remember, you only need to submit your time if you have exceptional time, i.e., vacation, sick, holiday, etc., 
 or if your rotation information has changed.  Enron does not track overtime for Analysts and Associates.
 
 Thank you for your cooperation.
