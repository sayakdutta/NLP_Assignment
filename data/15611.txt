 and find out what those numbers are.  Thanks a million.
 
 Best,

 Jeff - 
 
 FYI:  due to a change [again] in the system for Expense Reporting, *must* 
 have submitted your
 current Report by Wednesday, the 27th.  Otherwise, will have to start over in 
 the "new" system, however that 
 will be unavailable until Monday, July 2nd ...or so I understand.
 
 Except for whatever you incurred today, I'm current with your receipts 
 *except*
 whatever you spent on gas with your last (6/18 - 6/21) rental car (you noted 
 it but neither indicated amount(s)
 nor supplied receipts!).
 
 Thanks,
 
 Joseph
