      Gerald,
 
      Please review the attached files and provide comments by August 9.
 
      The siteag.doc is a proposed Compressor Site Agreement for the Powder
      River Basin.  This document was given to the ROW contractor by a
      landowner in the area.  In paragraph 6, I removed a sentence
      concerning the obligation to fence the site since we were instructed
      to only build a fence around the Main Station.
 
      The easement file contains a few modifications to accommodate future
      pipelines.  BLUE is where Ted (ROW Contractor) added something, and
      RED is where Ted suggest the wording be removed.  For example, Item
      #1, (the option) we removed because we are ready to obtain the
      easement, rather than only an option.  Item #16 was added to address a
      future line.
 
      Sincerely,
 
      Pam Sherman
