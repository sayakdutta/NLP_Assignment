 Enclosed please find redlined and clean copies of the versions of Executive 
 Summary and Policies and Procedure that we plan on posting on LegalOnline.  
 The most recent revisions reflect the newly announced Enron Wholesale 
 Services organizational structure.  There are still a few unanswered 
 questions relating to the EWS structure -- such as whether EWS will be an 
 actual entity or simply an unincorporated "umbrella" of certain businesses.  
 In large part, the revisions are simply more flexible versions of old 
 language in light of these unanswered questions.  I would not say that any of 
 the revisions amount to substantive changes to the policy.
 
 Please contact me with any comments or questions you may have regarding the 
 enclosed; however, please also keep in mind that we are on a very critical 
 path towards the scheduled roll-out of LegalOnline.  In that regard, it would 
 be greatly appreciated if any requested revisions could be made no later than 
 Wednesday, Nov. 29.  Thanks -- Bob
