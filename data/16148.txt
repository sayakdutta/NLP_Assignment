 shopping can begin....

 Jeff, please forward this to Prentice.  I will call Mom and Dad.  
 
 Finally, Mike and I are hosting Christmas Day at our house with a big assist 
 from Jeff on the dinner preparation.  I will probably do it the same way we 
 do Thanksgiving at Steve and Charry's by asking each of you to bring/make 
 something.  We are looking forward to having you all here.
 
 Debbie
