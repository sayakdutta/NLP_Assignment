 Noon brunch would probably work better for me considering Matthew's nap time and that Monday is a school day.  I will handling the kids solo since Lyne will be at MD Anderson with Elaine that day, so I hope everyone is patient with Matthew as sometimes he can be a little rowdy at restaurants (he has been known to inflict fear in waiters, waitresses and owners alike).  Remeber those days........

 What do we want to  do on Mother's Day?  Mom & Dad have A D Players that day (with me,  Henrietta, Ken, and Mary Ann) from 2 PM to 4:30 PM (or 5 PM ??).  Do we  want to do a noon brunch in the Kirby/Galleria area, or dinner in the same  area after A D Players?
  
 I gave mom a  heads-up a month ago about this overlap of events and she chose not to re-schedule A D  Players.
