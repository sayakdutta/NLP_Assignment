 Dear GARP 2001 Speaker
 ?
 Just a gentle reminder that the information I  requested for your 
 presentation at the GARP 2001 Convention,  was due in today. Can I please 
 have this information by Friday 8th  September so that I will have adequate 
 time to include all the details  in the brochure, which is due to go to press 
 very shortly. 
 
 The  information that I require as soon as possible is as follows:
 1. confirmation of professional details (including  the speaker's name, job 
 title, and organisation)
 2. confirmation that the topic title is accurate  and to your liking
 3. bullet points for your presentation (up to 5 to  6 bullet points - please 
 as technical and detailed as possible)
 4. contact details (including telephone numbers,  fax no, colleague/PA, full 
 address)
 ?
 If you have any questions please do not hesitate to  contact me, otherwise I 
 look forward to receiving the above information by  Friday 8th September.
 ?
 Kind regards
 ?
 Andreas
