 I had an opportunity to review your draft letter.  My thoughts are as follows:
 
  1.  I am not sure that I would limit yourself to discussions on the price 
 alone.  I might make some reference to discussing potential commercial
       resolutions to avoid the reopener.
 
  2.  You make a reference in the letter to "GSA".  I do not think that is 
 defined anywhere else and probably needs to be.
 
 Other than that, I am fine with the letter.  I will leave it to Richard to 
 finalize this with you.
 
 Thanks, Jeff

 Please review/revise the attached and resend to Lillian Carrol and myself.  I 
 am in Boston (Tues) returning Wed, but Lillian can sign for me.
 
 
 Thanks,
