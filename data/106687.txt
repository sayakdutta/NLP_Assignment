 
 Happy New Year!
 Attached is a new draft of the Enron Corp. guaranty which incorporates 
 Andrzej's comments of Dec., 1999 based upon exchanges with Russell Diamond 
 (Enron credit - physical).  Tanya Rohauer (Enron credit - financial) is 
 faxing Andrzej a copy of this guaranty as well.  
 I need to catch up on our previous discussion regarding the Schedule; you 
 should have received a draft of our Credit Support Annex just before the 
 holidays.  I will touch base with you in a few days.  Sara
