 Stan,
 I wish you the best over the holidays and long into the future.  Thank you for taking the time to attend the Christmas party and to visit with the staff in the Maitland office.  I'm forever impressed by the priority you place on meeting with the field locations.  The fact that you were able to do so during this difficult time is commendable.  We're rooting for your success at turning things around.
 Thank you,
 Mike
