 
 What kind of publicity have we been receiving over the weekend?
 I'm glad to hear that you're doing better.  You didn't look too good Friday.
 We had a great flight to Sao Paulo and then on to Houston.  I highly 
 recommend going out of your way to fly Continental.
 Mark is in Portland for a few days.  We are in competition (with Broadband) 
 for our star paralegal, but I don't give up easily.  Shari did announce to me 
 about her departure and may tell the paralegals today (I hope)
 Lynn and I are preparing a recap memo and we'll send a draft to you soon for 
 comment
 Talk to you soon.  Sara
