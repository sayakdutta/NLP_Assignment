 Here it is
 


 
 Gail ,evidently left Enron. Haven't seen her in ages.

 Vince
 
  
     
 Too bad.  It would be good to catch up.  Do you know the emails for:
 
 David Cox, Karen Owens, Gail Bennett?  I couldn't find an e-mail
 directory on Enron's web site.
 
 Have a great trip, enjoy London.  Thanks.
