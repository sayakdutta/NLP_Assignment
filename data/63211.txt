 John,
 
 I am interested in a power options trading position at Enron.  I have a track
 record of profitable options trading and market-making in illiquid markets,
 and have also worked closely with Origination groups to design and evaluate
 structured products for customers.  I attach my resume for your review and
 would welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications and background
 with you in person.  I can be reached at 214-812-8560 during the day and
 214-891-1705 in the evening.
 
 Regards,
 
 Manu
