 bought a new house ourselves.  We are moving in the 12th.  This weekend we're hitting Jazz
 Fest in New Orleans with Capt Frank P. Conway.  Talk to you soon.

 Hi Everyone,
 
 We just wanted to let you know that we are canceling service from our
 internet provider starting 4/26/01. We will let you know our new internet
 address, as well as the address of our new house, when we finally get
 settled in November.
 
 Love,
 Karen and Tom
