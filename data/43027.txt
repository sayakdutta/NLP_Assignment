 
 Rick Causey came to see me asking us to firm up our Q2 numbers.  Can we let 
 Rick know that your Q2 numbers are likely to be up?  If so by how much?
 
 
    
  
 -Presentation to potential buyer went well. Questions mostly around power
 supply trading, and risk/reward formula with customers and shareholders, that
 is in agreement with OPUC.
 -California's rolling black-outs have pushed up prices in the West, allowing
 opportunities for PGE to continue to sell into the market.
 -All IOUs, State Agencies (OR,ID,WA), Power Councils, BPA, and security
 coordinator met to address emergency preparedness. There is beginning to be
 heightened concern about Fall and Winter supply.
 -Union negotiations continued, and progress was made understanding needs and
 issues. Next meeting scheduled for May 21. Union seems to be in no hurry, and
 needs for time to get interests aligned.
 -De-reg Bill continues to be uncertain. It has become a political football,
 where legislatures are convinced, who ever carries or doesn't carry forward,
 depending on future power situation, will determine which party ends up in
 majority, and as governor in the state. Politics....ugh
 -Final contracts should be received tomorrow. Will work to turn them around as
 quickly as possible, but I know people will need a few days with them, and a
 few more issues may need to be addressed. There are some employment
 agreements, and other contracts that were put in place by others, that have
 created some benefits, that people feel they are giving up with new
 agreements. Some is perception, some is real, some is lack of trust for
 Enron's  intent, when things are not written precisely.
