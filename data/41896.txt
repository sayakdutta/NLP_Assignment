 ok - thanks for the parking tips.  I'll look for you at the bottom of the escalators at 7:00.  Looking forward to it!
 
  
     
 It would definitely be out of your way.  I don't mind driving downtown, so why don't we just meet at the Wortham at about 7?.  We have been parking in one of the outside lots off Smith right across from the side of the Wortham (the Bank One Lot) since the flood closed down so many of the underground garages.
 
  
     
 Why don't we have coffee after.  Can I pick you up either at your house or someplace on 1960?  No sense in you having to drive into the city too?  I wish I had a ticket for Ann!
 
  
     
 (713) 896-1673.  It doesn't matter to me if we eat before or go for coffee after.  The only places I know to eat near the Wortham are at Bayou Place.  I know there's Hard Rock Cafe, a barbecue place and I don't know what else is there.  Let me know what you want to do. If we don't eat before, I guess we can meet at the bottom of the escalators at the theatre.
