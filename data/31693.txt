 
 I'll give you an inviye to our party.  I don't know when or where or if I'm 
 gonna go but I'll give you an invite anyway.
 
 
 
 

    
 
 Is the invite only party? I have not received a personal invitation.... and
 this one is usually hard to crash. I'm putting my list together of all the
 parties. I talked to Victor... he said I could stop by the floor and train
 with you for about on hour... you're such a sweetie!!! Seriously... Victor
 said I could stop by and see everyone... since PG&E is not a threat to
 y'all. I'll either do it Tuesday or Wednesday afternoon.
 
 
     
 
 
 Transco party on the 21st.  I'm going, how about you?
