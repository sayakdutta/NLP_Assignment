 PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL:  ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION, ATTORNEY WORK 
 PRODUCT, JOINT DEFENSE PRIVILEGE
 
 Dear Larry and Merlin,
 
  This will confirm our various telephone conversations about the 
 above-referenced case.  Again, it is my understanding that we have all agreed 
 (me on behalf of Northern/Transwestern, Larry on behalf of Duke, and Merlin 
 on behalf of CMS Energy/Panhandle Eastern) to jointly retain Jim Peters to 
 represent our respective interests in responding to the defendants' subpoenas 
 and recently-filed motion to compel, which I have been advised is set for 
 telephonic hearing on Monday, August 14, at 8:00 a.m.  Per this agreement, we 
 will share Jim's fees and expenses on a 1/3 Northern/Transwestern, 1/3 Duke, 
 1/3 CMS Energy/Panhandle Eastern basis.  As part of this agreement, each of 
 us agrees to handle substantially all of his respective client's actual 
 document production in-house, in order to hold Jim's fees and expenses down.
 
  In the very unlikely event that Jim encounters an unanticipated conflict 
 between the positions of our respective clients, you additionally agree that 
 Jim may withdraw from the representation of your clients in this matter, but 
 may continue to represent Northern and Transwestern in this matter.
 
  Jim is currently working on a draft response to defendants' motion to compel 
 for Northern/Transwestern.  By copy of this, I am asking Jim to send each of 
 you drafts at the same time that he sends a draft by me.
 
  I look forward to working with you both.
 
      Regards,
 
      Britt Davis
