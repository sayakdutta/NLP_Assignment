 It's a weather question.  Looks like Carol asked Susan or Stephanie to let 
 Celeste know if weather trades were possible (she thought it was).  If 
 weather is a commodity, I guess it works but you'd probably need to 
 inocorporate ISDA terminology and your definitions, etc.  Check the blue file 
 - you'll see Carol's email.

 Sara, the weather group is wanting to get Sempra prepared to do weather 
 trades, how should we proceed?
 
  
     
 Celeste:
 I think that we need to execute an ISDA to do weather trades with Sempra as 
 the 2/22/96 Agreement appears to only work for commodity trades.  If this 
 needs to be pursued further, please have someone contact Sara Shackleton as I 
 am moving to the power group.  Thanks.
