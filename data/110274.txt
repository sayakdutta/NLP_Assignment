 
 Hey,
 
 You better do something about the crappy weather.  I mean, am I going to have to bring my ski jacket?  So, I'm planning on going into the office early on Friday, but I'll be done by 9 am probably.  Don't feel like you have to take any time off because of me.  I'll find plenty to do with people from the office or by myself (like make up sleep for when I get up at 5 am to go into the office).  So, I'll take care of a dinner venue and accomodations for Saturday night, but other activities are in the air.  If Bonneville is on the way, that's cool.  I suppose there's probably some cool hikes/drives around the area with great views.  Let me know if you have any suggestions.  Anyway, today was pretty hectic as well here, but now its quiet, and I'm ready to go home....and look at that, it's 5:30 already! 
 
 Hope you're staying warm and dry.

 Hi Mat,
 
 It is raining and cold here today.  Hopefully, the weather will be good when
 you come to visit.  Are you going to take that Friday off, or are you going
 into work?  I might be able to take it off if you are.  Well, I am still
 super busy at work, but am able to find the time to corresponde  with you.
 I am excited that you are coming to visit and that we get to go on a field
 trip, it will be fun.  I hope you are having a good day.
 
 Miss You,
 Laurel 
 
 
     
 
 Hey, I think I lost your work number.  Can you send me it or give me a
 call at work.

 No, this woman that I work with informed me that in the beginning it was
 the
 goat.  Why she needed to share this with me I don't know.  What do goats
 and
 fraternities have to do with one another?  I am not familiar with the
 goings
 on of fraternities.  Did you have some sort of run in?  Do you need to
 share?
 
 
     
 
 goat?  i think that's only true for fraternity pledges.
 
 
     
 
 What?  You didn't like that story.  You know it wasn't my idea, I was
 coerced into the closet.  Ok, that doesn't sound very good.  I just
 found
 out that the goat was originally man's best friend.  Interesting eh?
 
 
     
 
 No foreced drinking, just one ceremonial shot of tequilla.  I think
 they're saving it up for this weekend.  I think we're having a party on
 Saturday.  I don't know if we have any closet shelves that I can fit
 into, though.....
 
 
     
 
 Did people try and force glasses of alcohol on you just because it's
 your
 birthday?  That is always nice.  Sometimes it seems like other people
 are
 way more excited that it's your birthday than you are, and they just
 really
 want you to party.  I don't know, I am rambling.  I was up kind of late
 and
 so this morning I am a little slow.  
 
 
     
 
 More like 50 cents.....Canadian that is.
 
 
     
 
 Hi there,
 
 How are you feeling?  Like a million dollars or more like .50 cents?
