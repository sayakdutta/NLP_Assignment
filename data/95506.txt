 Did you watch the Astros / Giants game last night.  It was embarrassing.  I've never
 seen such a cowardly performance by a baseball team (of course I'm talking abt the
 Astros).  When do you ever walk a guy with runners on 1st and 2nd, your team is 
 down by 1 run and there is 2 outs?  Answer:  NEVER.  According to Dierker,
 "... the critical walk was the one with runners on first and second," Dierker said. "We did that because Jeff Kent was 3-for-17 against Williams and had struck out the last five at-bats (against him), so he showed some dominance against him. Obviously, you don't want to put another runner on base and move the runners another base in scoring position unless you have a very compelling reason, and we did.
 
 How's long's this clown been managing.  I guess he hasn't followed Kent the last few years.  It wasn't like he was walking Bonds to get to 
 Ivan DeJesus.  He doesn't even have the sack to admit he fucked up.  I've never seen fans boo their home team so much since the days of Michael Jack.
 
 Have you and Patty been getting any sleep? How's Jack?
