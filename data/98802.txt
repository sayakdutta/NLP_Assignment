 This is the San Francisco Superior Court case I believe -- The case number
 is the same.
 Thanks

 Steve, I have received notice of service in a lawsuit styled:  The People
 of the State of California, etc. v. Dynegy Power Marketing, Inc., et al.
 (including Enron Power Marketing, Inc. and Enron Energy Services, Inc.)
 that was filed in the California Supreme Court, County of San Francisco
 (#318189).  I know that this is not in San Diego, but wanted to make sure
 that it was not the lawsuit that you were tracking earlier.  It is a
 complaint for unfair, unlawful and deceptive trade practices regarding the
 deregulation of the California electric power industry.  Let me know if you
 think it is the same.  thanks, Becky

 your tip about the website that led me to the firm.  Thanks.

 Steve, not yet.  He did say that the complaint would be posted today on
 this website:  ucan.org.  You can look there as well to see if it has shown
 up.  I've got a couple of fires to put out and then I'll try him again.
 Sorry for the delay.
