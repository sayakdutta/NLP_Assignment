 Vince, 
 
 I hope you are well. Until today, I did not know there was another Kaminski 
 at Enron. Perhaps you know him already but I found him in the Enron address 
 book his first name is Jim.
 
 I am enrolled in the above mandatory program and I have nominated you in the 
 peer/colleague category,  to provide feedback on me. I do not know the nature 
 of the questions you would be required to respond to but sometime soon you 
 would receive an e-mail asking you for your input. 
 
 I know your plate is full and life is already hectic but I thought I could 
 nominate you for your input.  I should be grateful if you would take some 
 time off your very hectic schedule and provide the feedback on me.
 
 Very many thanks,
 
 Tony
