 hey dude-
 
 what's new?  
 
 i'm coming home dec 16 - jan 3.  are you planning on being around?  be
 great to catch up on life.  
 
 i haven't talked to anyone from hs in the last year or so - feeling lame
 and out of touch.  i hear howard is engaged.  
 
 things are going well for me, although job situation is somewhat uncertain
 at this point ...  i'm sure you've seen what's going on with enron.
