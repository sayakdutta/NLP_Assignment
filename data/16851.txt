 
 We haven't been to the PUC about re-sourcing our customers.  Sue mentioned 
 that this morning.  Good idea to get over there.  Mike's going to the PUC 
 tomorrow to make the rounds.  
 
 Is there legislation on DSM and expedited siting?  I haven't seen anything 
 we've provided on DSM or expedited siting-related legislation.

 Loretta, in testimony at an unrelated hearing at the Assembly, trashed Enron 
 for leaving the state.  Has anyone b riefed the CPUC?
 
 Jeff SKilling will be in Silicon Valley for the next  few days...Rick asked 
 that we prepare talking points for the legislative arena for the Silicon 
 Valley.  We are working on talking points with the coalition on direct 
 access, but we need info on demand side management, and expidited 
 siting....have we already provided anything to him on these subjects?
