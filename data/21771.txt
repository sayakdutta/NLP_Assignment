 The Analyst Program had a successful recruiting season.  As a result, we are 
 expecting  94  analysts beginning this August and would like to discuss your 
 staffing needs for a full-time Analyst(s).  To implement this process, please 
 provide me with your departmental needs and what skill sets are necessary.  
 
 Please include the following in your response:
  * head count (number of analysts needed)
  * skill sets required
  * overview of job description.
  
 Once I have received your response, resumes will be forwarded to you for 
 review.  We have a pool of great talent coming in and the placements will be 
 on a first-come first-serve basis. 
 
 Thank you
 Shelly Jones
 Manager, Analyst Recruiting
