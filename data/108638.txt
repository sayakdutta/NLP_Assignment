 
 hey bubbie,

 Jeff
 
  
     
 Are you in this weekend?
 
 		

 		 		 		 
 		I was just cleaning out my mailboxes, and hoped the tone of
 my last one
 		wasn't misinterpreted by you.  Sorry--but you know I'm still
 that same
 		loveable guy.
 
 		I think I'll be in NYC toward the end of next week.  Drinks?
 I'll bring
 		the watch for you to wear out to the bars, so you can see
 how it attracts
 		the ladies.
 
 		Later,
 
 		Jeff
 
 		    

 		    		    		    
 		   I will do my best on the girlfriend, and I am 90% sure I
 can do the
 		   watch.
 		   Yours is white gold right?
 
 
 		           

 		            		            		           Subject:
 
 		           Bubbee,
 
 		           How's it going?  Definitely, next time I'm in NY,
 I'll let
 		   you take me
 		           to dinner--at least drinks.  By the way, I don't
 know if you
 		   know that
 		           I'm currently offerring a car to anyone who finds
 me a wife.
 		   Keep it in
 		           mind.
 
 		           Anyway,  I paid $10,900 plus tax, total
 $11799.25.  For you
 		   $6,000.
 		           There are no more available, only 1912 were made
 in total.
 		   (divided
 		           between white, yellow and rose gold.)  1912 was
 when the
 		   model came out,
 		           and this was a reissue.  I have all papers, and
 box.
 
 		           Find me a girlfriend, please.
 
 		           Jeff
