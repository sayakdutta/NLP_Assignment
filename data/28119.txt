 was up here yesterday with Stan.  He seems like a good guy and is pretty gung 
 ho about getting on board.  Lets keep in touch.  DF

 ATTACHED IS AN IMPORTANT ORGANIZATION ANNOUNCEMENT THAT SHOULD GO OUT TO ALL 
 GPG EMPLOYEES IMMEDIATELY:
 
 The timeliness and confidentiality of this announcement have made it 
 impossible for us to use the Notes Team to handle distribution via e-mail, as 
 would normally be the case.  As a result, please forward the message to 
 everyone in your respective department(s).
 
 Note to those of you whose departments include field locations:  We are 
 sending the announcement to all field locations via burst FAX, so you should 
 not need to e-mail copies.  Faxes will be distributed at approximately 10:30 
 this morning.
 
 Please call Lisa Costello (x31819) if you have any questions.
