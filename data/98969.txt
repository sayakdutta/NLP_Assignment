 One of my partners has asked me to seek a conflict waiver so that we may
 represent Clean Air Partners in a transaction opposite of Enron Corp.  We
 would be preparing transaction documents for the private placement such as
 Series A Stock Purchase Agreement, The Investors' Rights Agreement, Amended
 and Restated Articles of Incorporation, Voting Agreement, Co-Sale, Drag
 Along and Rights of First Refusal Agreement etc.  As a condition of this
 waiver, Clean Air Partners understands and agrees  that under no
 circumstances can Brobeck's representation of Clean Air Partners result in a
 conflict of interest for Brobeck in its representation of Enron.  The
 individuals at Enron that are involved in this potential transaction are:
 Charlie Vetters and
 Kyle Kettler.
 
 Will Enron grant a waiver for the firm to represent Clean Air Partners as
 described above?
 
 Thanks
 Gary
