 Michelle and Kriste: 
 You probably know about this case already, but this was filed this week in Federal Court: 
 Pamela Tittle et al. v. Enron Corp. et al. 
 11/13/2001-3913 
 The description of the facts are: 
 Possible class action ERISA violation case in which the defendants failed to fulfill their fiduciary duties to an Enron employee retirement plan by misrepresenting the financial status of hedging agreements made with third party partnerships.
 The plaintiff's attorney is Robin Harrison.  I know Robin quite well.  He does not do that much employment work, and is more of a commercial litigator.  As you know, I have done a substantial amount of ERISA work and would be interested in helping Enron out on this case.  Please let me know what we can do to help.
