 
 b/c i want you to understand when i am out of money, but if you owe me dinner and are out of money i cant understand.
 
  
     
 how is there a double standard?
 
 
     
 
 there is a double standard here so i can't understand
 
 
     
                 
    i do understand your situation, but you should understand mine too.
 
    
                 
 
    probably not.  i think you should understand my situation.
 
        
                             
       how convenient.  actually, i don't really have any money either,
    maybe
       we
       should just call it even.  what do you think?
 
       
                             
 
       yeah.  i had it picked out and everything.  i had to call the dealer
    and
       tell him i am not going to suprise you with it.  we can still go to
       dinner
       tomorrow night though.
 
           
                                         
          that's too bad.  so, does that mean i'm not getting my bmw from
    you
          anymore?
 
          
                                         
 
          our stock is taking a bath.
 
              
                                                     
              i was just about to email you.  why is it worthless?
 
             

                                        
 
             my 401k is now worthless.  i have no money.
