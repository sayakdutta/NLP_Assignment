 spent much of this weekend thinking the exact same thing.  I'm pretty sure 
 the Monte concert is on a Saturday night, but I'll have to double check on 
 that.  I got to see Mr. Smith Goes to Washington this weekend on the big 
 screen at the old River Oaks Theater, it was wonderful.  And, Emily, Katy and 
 myself went to Tin Hall Saturday night to see Earl Thomas Connally.  We met 
 the three cutest, nicest real cowboys there.  It renewed my faith in the 
 opposite sex.
