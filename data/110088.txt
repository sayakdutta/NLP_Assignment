 
 Chris,
 
 This spread sheet contains the new WIC meters, as discussed.  I also 
 discovered that there are about 200 meters we current get manually for CIG 
 that also need to be added to the database.  They are included in the 
 attached file on separate sheets.  Meters already existing in the database 
 are not included for either pipe.  Can you please dump these into the 
 database and set up additional sheets in the Socal manual entry spreadsheet 
 for these meters.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.
 
 Mat
