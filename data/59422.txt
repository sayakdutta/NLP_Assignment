 Kam,
 
 Does this give you what you need?

 Kam,
 
 Many of the SW curves have become obsolete since losing Enron's obscure deals.  Therefore, we would prefer to reduce our curves to the following:
 	
 	BASIS				INDEX				GDI-Index			PHYS			
 
 	NGI-SoCal			NGI-SOCAL			GDP-CAL BORDER		NGI-SOCAL
 	IF-ELPO/SJ			IF-ELPO/SJ			GDP-ELPO/SJ			IF-ELPO/SJ
 					IF-ELPO/PERMIAN		GDP-ELPO/PERM		IF-ELPO/PERMIAN
 
 
 
 Mike would like to kill Kingsgate in the NW.
 
 Thanks
 
 
  
     
 We have created six new curve files for UBS.  Could you please look at them and let me know if there is something in your files that you are not responsible for and we will move them.  Also, you can use these files to change or update your links.    O:\_dropbox\West Curves
 
 We will probably be loading these on Wednesday for the first time to do our final testing so let me know if you have any questions or need our help with this. 
 
 Can you let me know when you have finished with yours so we can convert them to the new database?
 
 Thanks
 
 Kam
 
 
 If you have already done this let me know, Phillip is out all week and I don't know where he left off.
