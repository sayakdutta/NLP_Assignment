 
 This one came after the one you sent (which I commented on by voice mail) but 
 is even worse.  I hope it was an earlier draft rather than a later one.

 Attached is a draft press release announcing the first metals trade on EOL.  
 Please provide any changes to me by 9:00 am (CST) on Thursday, July 6.  If 
 everyone signs off by that time and we can get corporate PR and IR sign off 
 shortly thereafter, this could go out on Thursday, July 6.  Otherwise, we 
 will more than likely wait until Monday, July 10, since Friday is a horrible 
 day to distribute a press release.
 
 If you have any questions, please call me at 713-853-9053.  Thanks.
 
 Eric
