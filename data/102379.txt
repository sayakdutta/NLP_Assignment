 
 John Buchanan and I discussed TW's transfer of gas from the PG&E/Topock 
 receipt/delivery point to the PG&E/Topock Park N' Ride point to implement 
 TW's use of PG&E's Market Center service.  My understanding is that 
 physically the points are one and the same, and that the transaction will 
 simply be a paper transfer.  Since a contract is required in our system as a 
 formality to implement the transfer, the rate TW will "charge" itself for the 
 transfer is $0.  
 
 This message is to confirm that I see no legal or regulatory problems with 
 the above scenario.
 
 If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to e-mail or call
