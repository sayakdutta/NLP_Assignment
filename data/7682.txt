 
 I would enjoy being involved in the kickoff for the first Gas Ops program.  
 Keep me posted on date and time.  Thanks for attending the meeting 
 yesterday.  I hope that you will let me know when and how I can best be 
 involved and provide support for your efforts.  --Sally 
 
 
 
 

    
 
 Sally:
 
 Thanks for inviting us to your Monday staff meeting.  We're very excited
 about getting things up and running.  Your continued support has been/will
 be invaluable.
 
 Be sure and let Barbara or I know if you have any
 questions/concerns/requests.......
 
 If you're available, it would be great if you could 'kickoff' the first 'Gas
 Ops' program.  We'll keep you posted on schedule, location, etc.
 
 
 Take Care
