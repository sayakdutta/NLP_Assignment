 I just noticed one minor error.  I think that you are trying to highlight 
 that Terry Winter, the Chief Executive Officer of the ISO voted against the 
 proposal.  In the text, you say the Chairman of the ISO.  There is no 
 Chairman of the ISO.  There is a Chairman of the Board of the ISO -- Jan 
 Smutney-Jones -- who has consistently voted against the price caps since 
 June.  Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.
