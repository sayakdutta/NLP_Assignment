 
 Dale,
 
 Thanks for your message.
 I don't know the labor market  in London that well but here the market
 for quants is very hot.  Steve is in my view an exceptionally talented person
 and I would go an extra mile to retain  him long-term for the company.
 
 I would adjust the base salary or the kicker upward a bit.
 o62,000 Basic  is what Anjam is receiving currently  (if I remember 
 correctly). Steve has a much higher value
 to Enron than Anjam.

 Vince,
 
 This is the package HR is proposing for Steven.  What do you think?
