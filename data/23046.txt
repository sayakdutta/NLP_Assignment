 Dear  Jim,
  
 I have been working  with Tony Jarret (Director, Tax Research) and David Eldridge (IT, Tax  Department) at Enron; learning about Enron and how a knowledge management tool  could help everyone in Enron do their jobs more efficiently.  Presently, we  are very strong in the Legal Vertical due to the overwhelming amount of content  that lawyers deal with on a daily basis.  I have attached 3 documents that  you might find interesting, as they relate to the Legal Vertical.  Should  you have any questions, please contact me at your convenience.  I look  forward to learning more about the Enron Legal Department.
  
 Regards,
