 Volume Management should be fine with this change. All name changes will be 
 still attached to the original path of the Buy/Sell deal. The Settlement 
 Group will have to make sure that the new name that is being added to the 
 deal has the appropriate 'Statement Group' attached.  Other than that this 
 change should flow smoothly.
 
 Thanks,

  Assignment)  
 
 FYI....
 
 This change went in for the Deal Validation group.   It gives them the 
 ability to change counterparties names after bridge back.
 
 Impact to Logistics - Unify
 If a counterparty name change takes place to deals that have been bridge 
 backed, it could cause problems on EDI pipes as that new counterparty name 
 will flow over to Unify and repathing should eventually take place.
 One problem may be with the Imbalance data sets, which are not in production 
 yet......(EDI Imbalance Qtys would not match up to paths)
 This may also cause an issue with the scheduled quantities (especially where 
 nominations were sent for entire month)
 can't remember the rules on this one, but I think Unify does have some safe 
 guards (idiot proofs) to force re-pathing.
 Unify does have the ability to over-ride duns numbers, yet would still cause 
 an additional step for EDI the scheduler would need to think through in order 
 to get a clean quick response.
 What are (if any) impacts to Vol Mgt if counterparty name changes take 
 place?  (prior periods?  re-pathing?)
 
 I have a call into Diane and Dave both.  After speaking w/ them, hopefully I 
 can get a clear understanding of the true impact.  I am sure we'll need to 
 put some processes and procedures together for Deal Validation to follow when 
 these type of changes are needed.
 
 Will keep you posted.
 
 Thanks,

 Regarding the ability to change counterparties on deals in SITARA with 
 confirmed volumes - Tom's words of caution:
 
 If someone calls you and wants to change a counterparty - we created the 
 ability for you to invalidate the deal - and 
 then change the counterparty - however - I did add a warning message:
 
 "Warning - changing counterparty on deal with confirmed volumes - make sure 
 pipeline allows this change."   
 
 Some pipelines do not allow us to change counterparties after there is 
 feedback - I assume for the same reasons
 we had this rule - it used to blow up our old scheduling systems 
 (pre-UNIFY).  Some pipelines will require a new 
 deal and we will have to zero out the old deal.
 
 Before you make the change - make sure the logistics person is aware - just 
 in case it causes problems with their
 pipeline.   Sorry - I don't know which pipes these are - you will have to ask 
 the UNIFY team.
 
 There is one rule still in place - you can change from ENA-IM East to ENA-IM 
 Market East - but not from 
 ENA-IM Texas to HPLC-IM HPLC - when changing business units - they must be 
 the same legal entity. 
 "Warning - not the same legal entity"
 
 Also - beware of making contract and counterparty changes to Service deals 
 (Transport Capacity, Storage, Cash Out).
 Once the deal is invalidated - there are no rules.  Don't forget - the items 
 were locked down for a reason.
  If you invalidate a service deal - and change the previously locked down 
 data that was validated - and someone used these
 deals in UNIFY - it is highly likely that the UNIFY deals and paths created 
 using these deals will get corrupted.  Always check 
 with someone from UNIFY to make sure no one used these deals for anything in 
 UNIFY.

 With the release that was put out Tuesday evening, Deal Validation should be 
 able to change the counterparty on deals where the volume is something other 
 than expected (e.g. confirmed, nominated, scheduled, etc.).  
 
 In addition, this release will also capture "near-time" the contract changes 
 that are made in global.  This means that need for server bounces will not be 
 necessary.
 
  New/Changes to contracts will show up without having to get out of deal 
 manager.
  New Counterparties, and new/changes to facilities will require getting out 
 of all active Sitara apps (except for launch pad).  
   Once out of all apps, start a new app - the respective information that you 
 are looking for will appear.
 
 I mention "near-time" because we are constrained by the amount of time it 
 takes for the change in Global data to trigger an alert for Sitara who then 
 updates its information
