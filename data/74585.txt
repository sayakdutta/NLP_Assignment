 
 Hi Lee,
 
 I haven't checked to see if the PS Stabilizers are included.
 
 How does this look?

  Attached please find the latest Salmon Energy Turbine Agreement
 (second document below), as well as a blackline (first document below)
 showing changes made to the version circulated last Friday.  Pursuant to
 your instructions, the performance values in Article 10 are per the 24
 Unit master agreement.  In addition no changes have been made to the
 Maximum or Unit Liability Amounts or payment schedule. To complete the
 agreement, we will need to insert the date of execution and Exhibit H-2.
