 
 Legal has been asked to review and approve all confirmation templates currently being used.  We would like to schedule a meeting to discuss the materials we will need for this review.
 
 Will you advise me of your availability in the next few days so that we can schedule a meeting?  (Diane, I realize we will have to work around the one hour time difference between Houston and Calgary.)
 
 Thanks!
