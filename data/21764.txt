 This may sound redundant considering the exercise we just completed but 
 please ask your respective groups what their needs are for FULL TIME ANALYSTS 
 late this summer.  These Analysts will start in the business units on August 
 1, 2000 and they will be allocated on a first come first serve basis.  Please 
 respond back to me no later than Monday by 5:00pm.  Also, please inquire 
 about your groups' needs for FULL TIME ASSOCIATES who will be available to 
 the business units on September 1, 2000.  We will be needing that number 
 also.  There are 94 Analyst  and 70 Associates that will be coming on board 
 this summer. This is in addition to each of your groups' immediate needs.  
 Thanks for your help.  Ted

 Please facilitate through Mr. Oxley.

 The Analyst Program had a successful recruiting season.  As a result, we are 
 expecting  94  analysts beginning this August and would like to discuss your 
 staffing needs for a full-time Analyst(s).  To implement this process, please 
 provide me with your departmental needs and what skill sets are necessary.  
 
 Please include the following in your response:
  * head count (number of analysts needed)
  * skill sets required
  * overview of job description.
  
 Once I have received your response, resumes will be forwarded to you for 
 review.  We have a pool of great talent coming in and the placements will be 
 on a first-come first-serve basis. 
 
 Thank you
