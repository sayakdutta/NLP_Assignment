  I thought you needed him to carry two people.

 I spoke with Wayne Mays - he spoke with Coleman and Virgo and confirmed my understanding:  Wayne's RC has the following people:
 
 Portland:
 Bill Williams - Development
 Mark Mullen - Development
 Larry Soderquist - Transmission
 Stan Gray - Transmission
 Don Hamond - Transmission
 Jodi Blackburn - Contracts
 Patty Deas - Admin
 
 Houston:
 Walter Koffer - Transmission
 
 Most of Walter Koffer's work is for the East, but Wayne pays for him because:
 - the other transmission people are part of Wayne's world;
 - West occassionally borrows people from Virgo - (1 person for two weeks, 2 people 2 hours a day for 3 months, etc.) and uses approximately one person-year. 
 
 This totals 9 people for the west - one less than a moth ago (kraszewski already left the company).  No one else should be charged to the west. The west should not be used for arguing the existence of other technical people in the east.  My budget will show 8 people for tech services which means that I intend to reduce by one more - likely to occur in Q1.
