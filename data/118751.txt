 
 I have explained to Bryan that the legal due-diligence effort for reference 
 entities for trading on EnronOnline will be a lengthier process than that 
 which we were able to accomplish before the launch of the EnronCredit.com 
 page.  That process is now underway.  Going forward, I would hope that we 
 will have more lead time and be able to complete the process for both sites 
 before a reference entity is used.

 It is my understanding that the EnronOnline approval process is separate and 
 approval for EnronCredit.com does not automatically mean approval for 
 EnronOnline.
 
 Debbie/Mark: Can you confirm or refute my understanding?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Dave

 EnronCredit.com.  It is our understanding that we can quote any of these via 
 EnronOnline subject to approval from the EOL team.  Pls. confirm this 
 understanding to all of us but especially mssrs. dilworth and forster
