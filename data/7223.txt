 this note interesting.  Since we compete with Big 5 for talent at several 
 schools, we should be aware of the make up of some of their job offers that 
 lure students to join them.    Paying for a masters degree at UVA ahead of 
 time is certainly an interesting piece of this job offer.  See note from Lexi 
 below.

 Dear OU Team:
 
 I just received notice from Jon Beck that he is declining our offer.  He has 
 accepted with E&Y in Dallas.  They have offered to pay for his Master's of 
 Accounting at the University of Virginia BEFORE he begins working for them.  
 This is truly a wonderful opportunity for him, but I know how disappointed 
 many of us are to see that he will not be joining the Enron team.
