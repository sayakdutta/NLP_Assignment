 
 should be non bondad
 
  
     
 Jane, on deal 763736 for May 01 sales to Southwest Gas, we have a pricing discrepancy.  Our system reflects SJ Bondad GDP but SWG is going to pay us based on SJ Non-Bondad GDP.  Can you please confirm which price is correct and make the change in Sitara if necessary?
 
 Thanks

 Sorry about the flooding.  Hope you and your family survived ok.  Attached are the gas settlement and support for May.  The only difference we had was for package V02.  Mark Anderson says that even though Bondad gas flowed, the price was Non-Bondad.
 
 Have a great day.  Nancy
