 Julie Gomez asked if we could talk with Rayfael.   He is an engineer at NASA who is interested in learning about fianancial risk management.   He will be coming to Enron the morning of April 19th (Thursday) for some informal discussions starting at 8:00.   Paulo and I are planning to talk with him.
 
 Vasant:  Are you available that morning?
 
 Vince:  Anyone else you would like to include?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Stinson
