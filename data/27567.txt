 the guarantee because of the complexities of their ownership structures.  You 
 also wouldn't want to go outside of ETS because of marketing affiliate 
 issues.  By process of elimination, I guess I'm OK with NN issuing the 
 guarantee.  In my view, if Mavrix' commercial strategies are unsuccessful and 
 Northern has to perform on the guarantee, good luck recovering any of those 
 dollars in Northern's next rate case.  Thanks.  DF

 Mavrix Transportation Trading Corp., which is a subsidiary of ETS, needs to 
 satisfy TW's creditworthiness requirements in order to enter into a 
 transportation agreement with TW.  Paul Cherry has suggested that Northern 
 Natural Gas issue a guarantee.  Please let me know whether you think this 
 would be acceptable.  If Mavrix wanted to hold NNG capacity, TW could issue 
 the guarantee.
