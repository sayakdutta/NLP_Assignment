 Attached is an ACR issued today requesting comment on the Rate Agreement
 reached by the CPUC and DWR (which I will send under separate cover).  The
 ACR highlights certain aspects of the Agreement and asks for parties to
 evaluate the effects of the Agreement and indicate what they believe the
 consequences of its adoption would be.  Comments are due by August 1st.
 
 The Agreement itself basically calls for DWR to set its revenue requirement
 based on "Bond Related Costs" and "Operating Expenses" and for the
 Commission to implement such revenue requirement.  It is up to DWR to
 determine whether the revenue requirement is just and reasonable prior to
 submitting it to the Commission.
 
 Please let me know if Enron is interested in Commenting on the Agreement.

 Attached is an assigned Commissioner ruling (ACR) inviting comment on the
 proposed rate agreement between the California Dept. of Water Resources and
 the California Public Utilities Commission.  Interested parties may file
 comments with the Docket Office on or before August 1, 2001.
 
 Please note that there are three attachments to the ACR. Attachment A, the
 proposed rate agreement, is being forwarded to you as a separate PDF
 document.  Attachment B, the relevant Water Code sections, is contained in
 the body of the attached Word document.  Attachment C is the two page letter
 from the DWR, the Dept. of Finance, and the Treasurer's Office to President
 Lynch dated July 2, 2001.  Attachment C was previously distributed to the
 A.00-11-038 et al service list in the Chief ALJ's ruling dated July 5, 2001.
 Today's ACR and all three of the attachments can also be accessed at the
 CPUC's web site.
