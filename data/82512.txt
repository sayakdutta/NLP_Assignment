 Hi Patrice,
 
 I left you a voice mail earlier, but I wanted to send a spreadsheet so you can see what I'm looking at. 
 
 Have the buyback prices been changed in Sitara? 
 Which months are you going to change?
 Is CSN going to be a prepay? If so, then I will add the Nov prepay to the invoice.
 
 Please take a look at the invoice and let me know if you think this is what they're looking for.
 
 By the way, I never got a chance to really thank you for bringing me along on the trip. I truly appreciate the learning experience and the chance to see firsthand how you interact with our clients. And it wouldn't have been quite as enjoyable with just anybody---you were great company! 
 
 Thanks!
