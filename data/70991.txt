 Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
 
 We have enclosed the initial draft of the LLC Agreement for CA Energy
 Development II, LLC, marked to reflect revisions from the LLC Agreement for
 CA Energy Development I, LLC circulated earlier today.  The enclosed draft
 reflects my understanding that commercial operation of the transformer under
 the ABB facility agreement and consent of ABB have no bearing on the timing
 for exercise of the put and call provisions in Section 6.2.   The enclosed
 draft is being furnished without prior review by ENA and is subject to
 further revision based upon such review.   Please review the enclosed at
 your earliest convenience and advise of any comments.   Thank you.
