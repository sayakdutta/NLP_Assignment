 Margaret - a couple of people have asked whether Enron would do more than the legal minimum of providing fare home for H1B visa holder i.e would they pay for other family members and possessions to be shipped home!  Is this one of the questions we are seeking a reply to?  - obviously this is one for Enron not the attorneys.
