 
 Per my conversation with Leslie, it is OK to open this counterparty for all 
 US physical power.

 Leslie,
 
 Theresa Mandola with EOL called and the referenced counterparty called her 
 and is already trading gas with us and would like to start trading power 
 online.  I looked in my database and we have them shut down for power.  Is 
 this a counterparty we could open up for power or not?
