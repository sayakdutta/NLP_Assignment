 
 Steve,
 
 Sorry I missed you yesterday.  There is a lot going on here and in S America 
 and we can probably discuss it next week.  I agree with your assessment of 
 and the need to clarify roles and implement the business plan.   We will 
 address all but there are some things going on that make it appropriate to 
 wait a little.  If you have any questions you can address them with Joe but I 
 would wait and keep moving forward on your daily business and projects.
 
 I like the plan and we will discuss my comments next week.  
 
 Thanks,
 mike
