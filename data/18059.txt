 Jeff,
 
 My name is Kurt Lindahl.  I recently joined Enron Global Markets on the LNG 
 team.  I'm the Lead Developer for the West Coast and have been charged with 
 building a (several) LNG terminal(s) on the west coast.  Michael McGarry, 
 from Enron Engineering and Operational Services Company, is the lead 
 Development Engineer on the project.
 
 A key question in this effort is, "Where is the best entry point into the 
 Socal/SG&E/PG&E pipeline systems.  In other words, where can we site a LNG 
 terminal and deliver natural gas into their systems, such that the amount of 
 facilities they require is minimal?  I spoke with Ben Asante who heads up the 
 optimization department in ETS.  He said that if we could get annual flow 
 diagrams for the California intrastate systems, he could prepare a model in 
 about 2 weeks time.  Interstate pipelines have to file Annual Flow Diagrams 
 at FERC, but I'm not sure what Intrastates' are obligated to file with the 
 CPUC?  That's where I need your help.  This is a hot subject, because the 
 race to site an LNG terminal is intense.
 
 Could you please call me at 713 345 5044 (O) or 713 515 2759 so that we can 
 discuss.  We want to keep this effort very confidential, so please maintain 
 secrecy.
 
 I will also want to talk to you about permitting and state approvals.
 
 Regards,
 
 Kurt Lindahl
