 I have not confirmed that these are the correct values, but this should get you started.  These are based on Socal's published long-term storage tariff.  I cannot confirm whether Socal has capacity at these rates available to sell.  Keep in mind I don't think the LNG project would incur the entire cost of the storage, as ENA could extract additional value from optimizing its operation.  It appears the cost is quite sensitive to the winter withdrawal rights, which I do not see any way around unless we can unload more of the cargo directly into the system and bypass the storage facility during the winter.  Please do not hesitate to call with any questions.
