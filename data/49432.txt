 Dear Dr. Kaminski,
 It was a pleasure talking with you and attending your talk today.
 I am a graduate student in Industrial Engg. and Operations
 Research working with Prof. Shmuel Oren
 on topics in financial instrument pricing and design of
 contracts in deregulated electricity markets. I am also
 doing research in auction models and computable equilibrium
 models with applications in electricity market design.
 
 I am planning to graduate with a Ph.D. in May 2001 and would
 appreciate hearing about any opportunities in your group at Enron.
 I am attaching at copy of my resume (file: cvrkamat.doc) for your perusal.
 
 Thanking you,
 Sincerely,
 
 Rajnish Kamat
