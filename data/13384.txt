 
 How about this:
 
 Any future grant/payment described on this worksheet is subject to 
 appropriate committee approvals and previously-defined performance standards; 
 the use of the term "guaranteed" on this worksheet does not modify the terms 
 and conditions of any such payment/grant.
 
 Too wordy?

 Michelle --
 
 Per our conversation, the term sheets list any future grants/bonus payments 
 as outlined in employment agreements.  The description that prints along with 
 the amount may say "Guaranteed Grant".  Of course we all know that it's 
 contingent upon Admin/Comp Committee approval.  However, to keep down any 
 question, we thought about adding an asterick and saying:
 
 "Any future referenced payments are contingent upon attaining appropriate 
 approvals."
 
 Please word-smith as appropriate.
 
 I appreciate your help.
