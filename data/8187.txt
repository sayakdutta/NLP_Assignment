 would choose to go elsewhere.  Would be nice to have them behind bars, 
 however. Doesn't make George W.'s record on executions look like such a bad 
 idea, does it?  
 
 I left Houston on Sunday afternoon.  Any new news on those 7?  --Sally

 Nope - we're fine. Thanks.
 
 The only thing we need is for the Texas police to catch the inmates on the 
 run - that's making Jo pretty nervous.

 Thanks for your e:mail message and your voice mail at home.  I appreciate 
 your nice thoughts.  
 
 I am in London all week - is there anything that you or Jo need that I could 
 bring back for you?  Just let me know.  I will be back in the office next 
 Monday, the 22nd.  --Sally

 Congrats Sal - very very well deserved.
 
 You are a top class colleague.
 
 Barry.
