 
 Jack Urquhart has inquired as to his continuing role for providing oversight of the Trojan decommissioning.  I think he sits on the review committee.  Please give your thoughts on this.  I think we need someone from Enron on the committee but given Jack's changing role he may or may not be the right person.  Please acknowledge receipt of this given our email difficulties.  Thanks
