 air business.  I talked to Dave yesterday and I think this is a great fit for 
 him.  He's back to doing what he does best--convincing investors and 
 customers to pour money into a hole in the ground!  
 
 
 
 

   
  
 
 I was in Houston Wednesday and got a chance to catch up a little with the 
 hooker&cooker tandem.  You may know that David has started into a new venture 
 selling either compressed air or energy from compressed air (he's not sure 
 which yet).  We agreed that his only concern is that you might want to enter 
 the market because with all your hot air, the market would be saturated!
