 
 There is no policy that I know of(don't make me write one)
 
  
     
 Richard --
 
 I was wondering if Enron had any formal policies on the release of information?  This is promoted by a call we had from Rep. Waxman's office.  The Rep would like a copy of the 4 page handout that Lay gave to key California Republican leaders in a "private" meeting in Beverly Hills reported in the LA Times recently.
 
 I think that we are going to give this information to Rep. Waxman's office, but we probably want a formal policy (ie, written) that would allow our legislative professionals in DC and elsewhere to say that some info is public and can be provided and other info will not be released.
 
 Appreciate your help.
 
 Jim
