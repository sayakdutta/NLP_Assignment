 Male Maturity
 
 When I was 14, I hoped that one day I would have a girlfriend.
 
 When I was 16 I got a girlfriend, but there was no passion. So I decided I
 needed a
 passionate girl with a zest for life.
 
 In college I dated a passionate girl, but she was too emotional. Everything
 was an emergency;
 she was a drama queen, cried all the time and threatened suicide.
 
 So I decided I needed a girl with stability.
 
 When I was 25 I found a very stable girl but she was boring. She was
 totally
 predictable and
 never got excited about anything. Life became so dull that I decided that I
 needed a girl with some
 excitement.
 
 When I was 28 I found an exciting girl, but I couldn't keep up with her.
 She
 rushed from one
 thing to another, never settling on anything. She did mad impetuous things
 and made me miserable as often as happy. She was great fun initially and
 very energetic, but directionless.
 
 So I decided to find a girl with some real ambition.
 
 When I turned 31, I found a smart ambitious girl with her feet planted
 firmly on the
 ground and married her.
 
 She was so ambitious that she divorced me and took everything I owned.
 
 Now I am 49 and just looking for a girl with big tits.
