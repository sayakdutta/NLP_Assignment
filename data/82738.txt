 
 Hi Melba,
 
 While we're in the midst of creating new products, will you please set up a 
 new product called:  NGPL North Shore Gas Company.
 
 The description should be:
 
 The interconnection between Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America and North 
 Shore Gas Company .  It should be mapped to Chicago.
 
 I would like to use this product tomorrow as well.
 
 Thanks for your help!
 
 P.S.   Also, you may just use North Shore Gas for the decriptor.
 
 Thanks
