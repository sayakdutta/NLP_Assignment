 
 Thank you so much for your message.  And thanks for sharing that particular memory.  It means alot to me.  I have always enjoyed working with you.  You have always been so quietly competent and thorough.  It made me smile just to see you.  You are an important part of "my Enron."  I take away from this place a great deal of learning and experience, but most importantly I take with me the memories of the wonderful people like you.  All the best.
  
     
 
 
 Steve,
 
 I am not sure if I will see you before you get away, but I am fairly sure I won't have an opportunity to say a proper farewell.  
 
 I want to tell you how much I have admired you and enjoyed working with you over the past several years.  To me, you have always epitomized what is good about Enron.  I remember the first time I met you -- you came to Jennifer Modisett's office to do a phone interview with a reporter on electricity deregulation.  During the interview, you never once sat down.  I remember being impressed with how knowledgeable and well-spoken you were, but mostly I remember being astounded by the passion you had for what you were doing.  Your passion was contagious -- it infected me and countless others.  You made Enron more than a company, you made it a cause. 
 
 I'm sure you're leaving here with mixed emotions, but know that you will be remembered fondly by so many people because you did great things here.
 
 Thanks for your leadership.  It will be missed.
 
 Terrie
