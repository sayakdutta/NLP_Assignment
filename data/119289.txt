 
 I haven't had any complaints from the post office.  In fact, we used to have a mailbox outside the gate.  It was a heavy metal box that required a key to open on a post set in cement. It was stolen (box, post, cement and all!) about three years ago and the mail carrier said that a gate key (their key does not fit any of the doors, mine or yours) was the best answer.  When I gave him the key, he put it on a huge chain with lots of keys that he uses on his route.  Has there been a problem?
 
 On the electrician, I am going to have some work done at some point soon but am waiting for the design people to finish and suggest a good electrician -- so nothing has happened yet.  I'll keep you posted.

 Mark,
 
 I spoke to the postmaster and she stated that the
 mailbox needs to be placed either to the side of the
 gate or outside of the gate.  She said that the main
 office does not like the fact that the postmasters
 have a key to a residence.  I don't know whether you
 have had the opportunity to speak with them yet.  If
 so, please disregard.
 
 Secondly, were you planning on having an electrician
 come do any work on your house?  If so, I would like
 to see if he/she can put a light in the bathroom as
 well as electrical outlets.
 
 I'll be awaiting your response.  Thanks!
 
 Veronica
