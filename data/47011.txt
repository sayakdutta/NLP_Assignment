 lbs 12 oz (3 weeks early).  Her name is Sophia Eleni.  Then my brother 
 Craig's wife had her baby on 1/9/01, a little boy name Daniel Francisco.  He 
 was 7 lbs, 12 oz.  Then one of the attys I work with had a baby, a little 
 boy, she lives around the block from me on Vassar, so a few of us went over 
 to visit her.  We had to cancel Lucinda's baby shower the night before it 
 because the baby was early.
 
 I'm a little afraid to go see Hannibal, maybe something a little cheerier...?

 Miss Jones,
 
 You are always booked up.  I thought maybe you had disappeared.  Has Lucinda
 had her baby?
 
 A movie sounds good.  What did you have in mind?  Hannibal?
 
 
 
 
 
     
 
 
 I've been booked up lately for various things (mainly people's new babies
 and home improvement tasks).  I've been wondering where you disappeared to.
 Do you want to do something this weekend.  There are a few new chick flicks
 I wouldn't mind seeing...

 Ms. Jones,
 
 I know you are working hard, but I needed to just check in and see how you
 are.
 
 Also, I just talked to Gale Ford, massage lady, and she said she will be
 working on Sat., March 3 in the afternoon.  I know weekdays are hard for
 you
 to make appointments and surely you are in need of a massage by now!!!!
 
 Let me know how you are when you come up for air!!
 
   Patti
