Even with load growth and, asset divestiture they wouldn't face the facts that the supply/demand picture was messed up.  They wanted all of the plants to be built in other states such as Arizona and Nevada.
 
 Environmentalists (fish people) were trying to get rid of the hydro dams in the Pac NW.  It is definitely an issue they, as well as California will experience this year as the dams are only filled to 55% of normal.  This equates to approximately 3000-4000 MWh short.  Typically in the summer, the pac NW exports about 4200 MWH to California.  Guess what - there will be no exports this summer.  The light WILL go out in Cali!!!!

 You seem to be up on current affairs associated with power.
 
  
 
 Reference to the power crisis in California, did the whacko environmentalist have anything to do with it???  I am hearing that California has not built any power plants in the last 10 years due to environmentalist putting on too many restrictions.
 
  
 
 One other question about the environmentalist trying to get rid of the hydroelectric dams in Washington State, will this lead to more power problems for California if they accomplish their goal?
 
  
 
 Let me know? jp
