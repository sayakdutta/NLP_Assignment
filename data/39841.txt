 
 I am confused by this.  Does this mean Cuiaba in South America would be 
 covered?  What is the significance if it is?

  As we discussed, the Purchase Right Agreement terminates on January 1, 2005. 
  Therefore, if an Eligible Project commences Commercial Operations before 
 January 1, 2005 (or if before January 1, 2005, an Enron Party acquires an 
 Ownership Interest in an Eligible Project that has commenced Commercial 
 Operations) and Limited Recourse Financial Closing has occurred with respect 
 to such Eligible Project, then the Enron Party must offer to sell to EGPP the 
 Ownership Interest of such Enron Party in such Eligible Project in accordance 
 with the Purchase Right Agreement.
 
 An Eligible Project is any Designated Development Project or Future Project 
 in which an Enron Party holds or aquires an Ownership Interest.
 
 A Future Project is any Power Plant or Natural Gas Pipeline (other than the 
 Designated Development Projects) that is located within the Territory and on 
 which construction has commenced or has been completed, provided that 
 pipelines primarily designed to transport liquefied natural gas or natural 
 gas liquids are excluded from Future Projects.
 
 The Territory is all geographic areas of the World, excluding areas within 
 the boundaries of the United States, Canada and Western Europe.
 
 Please let me know if you need further explanation.  Thanks.
