 burns & roe - greetings.
 
 our understanding is that our current PSA with you has lapsed.
 however, ms. renee alfaro has sent an extension letter to extend that PSA.
 at this time, enron's position is that we are unable to use the 
 lapsed/extended PSA for work on the coal initiative - i.e., accounting rule 
 requirements.
 
 however, we'll be sending you soon a cc of a PSA that is compliant with our 
 off-balance sheet accounting requirements.  plz stay tuned.
 
 but, in the interim, let's get started on the "short fuse" request for info 
 from enron using just a tasking letter with a not-to-exceed without prior 
 approval price of $10,000 and a commitment from enron to pay said related 
 invoice(s).
 
 attached is a copy of the tasking letter that we discussed on the phone.  plz 
 sign, date and return fax this tasking letter back to me.  upon receipt, i'll 
 sign, date and fax you back a record copy.
 
 plz call with any questions.
 
 regards.  scott.
