 Cooper, I had spelled your name wrong in my first email.  Have you been down to Fernieyet?  It has gotten tons of snow.  I think I am going to head down for a few days this week.

 Hey guys, hope everything is going well at work.  It is snowing pretty much everywhere so I am spending a bunch of time snowboarding.
  
 Drop me a line with your home emails so we can keep in touch.
  
 Talk to you later,
