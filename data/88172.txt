 
 FYI,
 In reference to your memo of May 5th,  I prepared and sent a new Master to 
 Pan on May 1st.  Since then, I have trouble getting in touch with anyone at 
 Pan to discuss the agreement.   The treasurer  referred me to  Rick Tucker 
 (713) 331-5049.  He stated Pan is not ready to consider new paper, as the one 
 in place is working fine and not priority.   But would review the new 
 agreement when he had time.
