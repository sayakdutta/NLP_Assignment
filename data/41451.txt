 
 Joe Hunter said he sent an interoffice envelope sometime last week (he doesn't remember who he sent it to) containing copies of a confirm on the J Aron website, together with a copy of a Service Agreement.  He needs to make a copy of the documents.  Has anyone seen these documents?  If so, please let either Joe (x33316) or me know.
 
 Thanks!
