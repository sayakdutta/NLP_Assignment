 
 Thanks.  Any view on the likelihood that the brief will have weight?
 Best,

 Jeff, this was filed last week.  The hearing is this morning. We are waiting 
 for a report from Bob and  Mike, who are in SF.  The Asst AG  may be arguing 
 at the hearing today. 
 
 





   
 Sue Mara (who's having computer problems today) just informed me that she's 
 heard a rumor floating around that Lockyear (sp?), the CA Attorney General, 
 or someone from his office, will file an amicus brief with the court today 
 supporting UC's action against us.  We'll try to get more info and report 
 back.  Vicki/Mike/Bob:  I'm assuming that you folks and/or our attorney's 
 will be there, so we'll get the details of any such appearance by the AG.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
