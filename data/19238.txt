 In fact, I think it's important to meet one-on-one with as many legislators 
 as possible, because I agree that the facts are pretty darned friendly.  I'll 
 look into setting up a meeting with her.
 
 Bowen in particular is being advised by enviros who think de-regulation is 
 still the best way to go.  And if it weren't for the for the 
 "undercollection/refund" issues, I think that she'd be pushing to move 
 ahead.  
 
 Unfortunately, while she may not be focused principally on a hanging, that's 
 likely to be where the hearing goes.  She's been unable in past to control 
 Peace at her hearings.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Does she have any interest in meeting one-on-one or is she just looking for a 
 public hanging?  I remain convinced that if we can just get the facts in 
 front of people they will modulate their approach.

 		  Monday
 
 Given the short notice, we will politely decline to participate at the 
 hearing on Monday, but will let the good Senator know that, in general, we 
 intend to engage actively in the process and plan to help California find a 
 solution that works for everybody.  Amen.
