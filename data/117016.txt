 We use two firms for U.S. derivatives advice - both in New York and both 
 highly recommended:
 
 David Mitchell of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft (212)504-6285
 Ken Raisler of Sullivan & Cromwell (212)558-4675
 
 David we use for contract issues - what should our forms look like under 
 various conditions, etc. and Ken, who is a former General Counsel of the 
 CFTC, we use for policy questions, political (lobbying) and e-commerce issues.

 Hi Mark:
 
 As Portland General Electric Company prepares for its sale to Sierra Pacific
 Resources later this year, we are reassessing how we deploy our legal
 resources.  To that end, we most likely will be in need of outside counsel to
 assist us with ISDA issues.  Is there a firm, or an individual that you could
 recommend?
