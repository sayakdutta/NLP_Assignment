 Hey Andy,
 
 the days are getting nice up here now - the winter was a bit brutal, but i'm getting stoked for the next few months.
 
 it seems like you just moved into that place no the east side.  time flies.
 
 my old apartment was on 15th and Madison and the building was called the La Salle.  
 When there were openings, there would be a posting on the front door.  and the building
 manager's phone number is also on a plaque there and you could call him to see if he
 is expecting any vacancies.  it seems like the beginning of the summer might be a good
 time to pick something up.   
 
 take care,
 
 Cooper
 
 
 
 
 
     
 Hi Cooper--
 
 I hope you survived the winter up there and are having a chance to enjoy the long summer days now.  Don't know if you've had a chance to come back to PDX, but it's been beautiful here.  (It hasn't been raining very much, you know...)  Anyway, my lease runs out in June and I'm thinking about moving.  Can you tell me what your old complex is called and/or where it is?  All I remember is it's near the east side of the Hawthorne Bridge.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Andy
