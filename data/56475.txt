 No problem. Feel free to mention our names.

 Hi Vince,
 
 I have pulled a list of names together that I would like to send some
 samples of our chapters of the book too, in the next couple of days,  in
 order to try and get one or two sentence "reviews" for the dust jacket of
 the book. I obviously won't say anything about Enron's sponsorship until it
 is official sorted out, but is it OK if I indicate that yourself and Grant
 are contributing material to the book?
 
 I'm proposing to send 5 or 6 chapters to the following - unless you have
 any objections or suggestions?
 
 David Shimko
 Ehud Ronn
 Helyette Geman
 Mark Garman
 Dragana Pilipovic
 Corwin Joy
 Ilia Bouchouev
 Alexander Edyleland
 Steve Thomas
 
 Hope the writing is going OK, and regards to Grant.
 
 Best regards.
 
 Chris
