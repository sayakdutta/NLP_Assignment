 
 Thanks.  I am waiting to speak to Pauline Kuo to schedule a time and place to meet her this week.  Hopefully we can meet Tuesday or Wednesday.  I will swing by your office to pick up the documents.

 Phillip, 
       I sent you a note that the changes have been made and faxed to Kevin.  
 Call me to arrange to pick up the originals or have them delivered where you  
 need them.  
                                                                          
 Thanks,
