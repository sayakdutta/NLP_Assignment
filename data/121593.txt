 
 Kathy,
 
 Just had another moment to say hello.  How are you and how are things?  Still busy here - and I haven't even seen Robin - I think she has given up on me!!  In fact, I think I will call her when I finish this email.  At least I know I will see her in a couple of weeks when Chris and Katie come to houston.  Wish you could come with them - that would be fun!
 
 Still working on the man situation - it was a topic of coversation amongst my friends last night.  I will keep you posted!
 
 Hope all is well and keep in touch!!
 
 Love, Kim
 
 
 
 

    
 
 I was thrilled to hear from you today.
 
 I sure miss you and Robin.  Seems strange not to be driving to your house
 on Thursdays now.  I have a little more free time now so I can quilt and
 visit with my grandchildren.
 
 Mel is back to work now and maybe things will be getting back to some
 what of a normal life for us.  The past year and half has been hard on
 us. I know we just have to be patient and things will get better.  You
 just go along with life and then when you or your spouse has health
 problems it creates a whole new ball game.  I have great faith in the
 Lord to see us through any thing.  Mel said to say hi too. ( he just came
 up to my office)
 
 When you get an address please email me that so when I finish your quilt
 I can mail it to you.
 
 Hope you find a nice man and your life becomes so full that
 maybe work will take a back seat.  Maybe a  big house you can fill with
 kids?????
 
 Take care of yourself and let me hear from you again.
 
 Love, Kathy
