 Group,
 
 Ryan sent this email out once already, here it is again.  The oasis site map is http://www.nwoasis.org/OASIS/NODE
 The details of checking for ATC are as such Red=PAC(t), Blue=IPC(t)
 
 Leg 1. PACW to ENPR
 Leg 2. ENPR to BOBR
 Leg 3. BOBR to PATHC
 Leg 4. PATHC to PACE
 Leg 5. PACE to FC3
 
 We can do a buy resell with EPE to move this to PV or can use APS tranny to move this to Mead or PV as well.
 When scheduling from BOBR to FC3 on PAC (t) be sure to just put in the POR/POD and do NOT schedule each wheel seperately.  This will prevent us from being charged $5.84 each time.  Total cost for this tranny should be $5.84 +$2.38 +$5.84 = $14.06.  There will also be losses.  If using this wheel for a services customer, be sure to add in for losses and scheduling fees.  Also, be sure to LOG OUT of the IPC website when finished, otherwise we will be locked out if we time out!  There should already be a template for a tag to move this energy from PAC system border in the NW to FC345.  This path has had approximately 400 mws of tranny availabe the last few days.
 Please see me with questions.
 
 Thanks,
 Bill
  
     
 As the southwest heats up, or the ISO goes into stages of emergency, or path 15 is congested north to south we will want to get power from the northwest utilities down to APS and so on in the southwest.  We can do this many ways but one that I have discovered that may have much capacity is as follows.
 
 1.  NW Utility to PAC on BPA(T)



 5.  Sink with anyone at four corners or buy tranny over to palo or mead.
 
 I'm not sure how long there is going to be room but for monday there is 400mw of room on this path.
 
 
 Enjoy,
