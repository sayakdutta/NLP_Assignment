 I wonder if they can answer the question, if the nominations were made at the existing pools, do they have the info to break those noms down so that they can separate them into the proposed pools?
 
  
     
 We'll send them a request for this information as well as the information on what supplies on their system are split-connected.
 
  
     
 I was thinking that may be we should ask El Paso to furnish aver. daily volumes that were scheduled as receipts into El Paso' system from the proposed 20 pools from Jan 1- Aug 31 of this year to get an indication of whether there is any gas behind these pools.  What do you think?
