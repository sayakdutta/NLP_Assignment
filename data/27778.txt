 As we discussed yesterday, please find attached three (3) documents - A 
 redlined
 Strangers' Gas contract, a Release Agreement, and a calculation of the amount 
 of
 $$ netting changed OFS' Strangers Gas payments.  Please review all of these 
 and
 give us a call when you are ready to discuss.
 
 Sincerely
 
 Steve Winston
