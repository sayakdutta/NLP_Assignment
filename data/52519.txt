 	FYI, the following website describes a variety of econometrics methods - which we plan to implement to solve the private firm problem.  
 
 	Many of these methods were briefly described in the recent draft of the Duffie document.  
 
 	Kyriakos will be writing a paper which will describe these methods in more detail.
