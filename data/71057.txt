 party escrow arrangement.

 I spoke with Mary Perkins in Treasury.  She indicated that we are currently 
 working with Chase Bank and City Bank for our third party escrow Agreements.  
 Mary will forward Kay and I electronic copies of both of their standard 
 agreements.  The timeline for a standard agreement is at least 3 days and 
 increases with the level of complexity of the Escrow Agreement's terms & 
 conditions.  The cost for either bank to set-up and administer the escrow 
 would be approximately $5-$10K, with additional cost if the Agreement was 
 overly complex.
 
 Kay:  Call me to discuss our proposed Escrow Agreement T&C's and how a draft 
 form of this Agreement should be best incorporated into the transaction 
 documents.  At a minimum, we should attach it as a sample form and have the 
 Letter Agreement(s) contain "substantially in conformance with" language.
