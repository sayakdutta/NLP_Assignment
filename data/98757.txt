 Some weeks ago, Richard sent me copies of some demand letters dated in 
 November to the "ENA Legal Department" that he suspected had been laying 
 around somewhere, and asked me to investigate.  I have had one meeting with 
 Enron's mailroom people, who I gave my only copies of those letters.  They 
 threw them away, thinking I had finished my investigation.  I have mentioned 
 this to Richard and asked him to send me additional copies, but it may have 
 slipped his mind.  Can you help me?
 Thanks.
 
 Britt
