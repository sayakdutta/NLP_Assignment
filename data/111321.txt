 I would reccommend sending out notice of trigger of Material Adverse Change 
 and calling for margin.  Can we prepare the notice..Bob Crane is in agreement.
 
 Thanks,
 Tanya

 We have financial exposure of 4.2MM to United States Gypsum company which may 
 file Ch. 11 due to mounting asbestos claims.  S&P has not taken any action 
 since Jan when they lowered ratings to BB-/Negative and removed from Credit 
 Watch.  However, USG announced today that it is considering "strategic 
 alternatives", one of which is Chapter 11due to increased litigation. I'll 
 forward the article.
