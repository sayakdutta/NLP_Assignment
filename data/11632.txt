 
 Was Reilly crawling home when he saw you at the underpass? Be happy to get together either in office or breakfast/lunch. Give me a call. Rick
 
 
     
 
 Jim Reilly said he had spoken to you recently after he saw me holding a sign
 under an I10 overpass.  Would love to get together with you to catch up and
 figure out what's going on at Enron and elsewhere.  I have attached my
 resume'.  We've all come along way since the BT days.  I'll call you in the
 near future to see when we can get together.
