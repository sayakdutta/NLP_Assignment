 
 I believe that all of you have met Frank (whose last name I can't remember), 
 the HR generalist who is currently working with Hector to serve the HR needs 
 for Energy Operations in ENA.   Frank is working on a contract basis at this 
 time, and Sheila Walton is seeking feedback on his performance to date in 
 order to evaluate the duration of his work as a contractor and the 
 feasibility of bringing him in as an employee.  I have given Sheila my 
 feedback, but suggested to her that you may have had more contact with Frank 
 than I have had.  Please take the time to send Sheila an e:mail message or 
 voice mail to let her know what your experiences have been in working with 
 Frank.  Your input will be very valuable to Sheila.   Thanks for taking the 
 time to do this.
