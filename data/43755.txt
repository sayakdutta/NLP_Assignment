If there is no appeal, then Enron will file a writ of execution with the local sherriff who will go out to the business and seize property in an amount to satisfy the judgement.  This is cheaper than hiring a collection agency and we retain more of the funds.  Let me know if you have questions.

 Kevin,
 
 Who in legal have you been working with?  Tracy was wondering when we thought we would receive the money.
 
 Thanks, Kim.
 
  
     
 Any idea when or if we will receive the money?
 
  
     
 FYI, Kim.

 Earlier this year I requested that the Enron litigation unit file suit against Oasis Dairy for collection of unpaid transport bills on TW.  The suit was filed in the fifth judicial district court in Chaves County, NM.  
 
 On October 1, 2001, TW was granted summary judgement in the case by the court in the amount of $29,250.56 inclusive of back interest and attorney fees.  This amount will continue to accrue interest at 8.75% per annum until paid by Oasis.  
 
 If you would like a copy of the judgement, please let me know.
