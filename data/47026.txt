 Here are the documents for Prebon and the order of what happened:
 
 1. Tana sends to Prebon
 
 
 
 2. Mark Greenberg incorporated Prebon questions into our LOI
 
 
 
 
 
 3. Mike Bridges deletes one sentence and forwards to Prebon
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4. Mike Bridges eliminates red lines of #3 above and sends for Prebon 
 signature (we should receive this document with a signature).
 
 
 
 
 
 Lets just make sure that #4 comes back and that it is consistent with #2 with 
 the only difference being the elimination of the last sentence in paragraph 2.
