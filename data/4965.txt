 John Cote asked me to forward this information on to any guys that I thought 
 might be interested.  Apparently, he thinks I know a lot of noble men here at 
 Enron.  All kidding aside, this sounds like a worthwhile thing, if you have 
 the time.  If any of you are interested, contact John Cote at ext. 3-3830.
 
 Hope everyone has a great 4th of July!
 Thanks,
 Christa
