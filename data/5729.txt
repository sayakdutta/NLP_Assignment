 Sorry to hear about mike's Dad.  I hope he is handling it ok.  I'm guessing 
 your weekend wasn't very fun.  
 We had a great time at the black swan, maybe you can come next time!  Let me 
 know when you want to come by.(if ever, ha!)

 Hey you,
 Sorry I didn't get a chance to come by this weekend, mike lutanno's dad
 passed away, so I was pretty busy keeping him company.  Other than that, not
 too much going on, and you?  I saw your roommate last night at church.
 Write back when you get a chance.
 
 Dee
