 
 I'll be glad to handle it so long as it doesn't have to be done this week, as 
 I have strep throat (Michael and I got a group rate at the peditricians' 
 office.)  
 Who should I contact?

 Hi Barbara,
 
 I'm on the phone with the GE folks right now, as we have a standing 
 conference call with them every Wednesday at 130.  I'm familiar with the 
 people and the contractual terms at issue, and will be happy to discuss it.

 Kay I received a call from Dwight Beech,who used to do powere-type work....he 
 is now in a different group.  While in that group he formed a relationship 
 with individuals at Jones Capital Corp. They have somehow discovered that 
 Enron has the above mentioned turbines and they wish to purchase 2 or 
 more......I understand from Dwight that there are restrictions which affect 
 ENA's right to sell the turbines to 3rd parties and that there may be ways to 
 structure around these.
 
 Please call so that we may discuss Ben Jacoby has been speaking with Dwight 
 and wants a basic term sheet AND a confidentiality Agreement.   bng    I 
 presume from our discussions you are familiar with the GE issues.
