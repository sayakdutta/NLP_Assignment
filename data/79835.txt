 
 Mark,
 
 The bigger issue is what are we going to do with EE&CC.  If their time is 
 coming and we need to split them up then I would agree with this but 
 otherwise I am not sure this is the best thing to do.  I have had very little 
 actual work with EE&CC in the past year and can't really comment on their 
 effectiveness.

 Larry:
 
 This fundamentally changes the entire basis of our approach to EECC and the 
 way that the engineering organization works. The idea was that the 
 engineering expertise resides in EECC.If u want to change that, it requires a 
 broader discussion.

 In light of the lesson learned on Project Lightening and in view of the 
 recent CALME reorganization, I suggest we simplify the payroll structure for 
 Development Engineers (DE's).  Currently, the DE's listed below are still on 
 EECC's payroll, although they are direct-line support to the Regions/Business 
 Units.  I suggest that all DE's transfer from EECC's payroll to the Business 
 Units they are supporting.  Some DE's are already on the regions' payrolls  I 
 don't think this will have a budget impact, because at this time each region 
 below is paying the total costs for these engineers, through EECC invoices.  
 Please let me know if each of you agree and I will have HR do the payroll 
 switch.
