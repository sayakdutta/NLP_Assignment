 Jeff,
 Great to meet you this morning.  I enjoyed learning about the directions
 that you have Enron moving in and I look forward to continuing discussions
 with you in the new year.  It was also nice to exchange notes with someone
 who shares the collecting bug.
 
 Have a good time out west and don't let Michael and Halley con you into more
 cold weather fishing.
 
 Thanks for breakfast,
 
 Nat
