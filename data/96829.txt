 Elizabeth and Mark,  thanks for your help in getting our bandwidth master sorted.  We've used the ISDA materials to relook at the formulation of the termination payment.  Could you possibly find it in your hearts to take a quick look at Section 5.4 regarding the calculation of the termination payment and the definition of Losses?  Again, I have tried to closely track the ISDA model.  Any thoughts would be gratefully received.
