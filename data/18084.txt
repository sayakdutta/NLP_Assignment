 a business reason, and though important, I don't think it clears your 
 hurdle.  No problem.  Never hurts to inquire, and I appreciate the 
 consideration.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 I would rather you not.  My policy on these matters goes something like
 this. If you have a valid reason like you are out of town on business, then
 you can take the exam by fax as close to the actual time as possible,
 certainly on the same day.
