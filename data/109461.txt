 Jeff,
 
 Thanks for getting back to me.  You probably saved us quite a bit of time and 
 money.  
 
 It looks like half of the City of London has been duped into helping E.ON 
 fool its shareholders.  I wonder how many of their other sales were actually 
 auctions versus pre-arranged sales dressed up for the shareholders.
 
 We will start our brainstorming sessions over again with a new rule - no 
 Germans!
 
 Thanks again,
 
 Joe
