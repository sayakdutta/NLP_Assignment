 i am flying out of state for an interview on monday.    i expect to fly again later next week.   
 i am still interested in being a part of a leaner trade floor at Enron,  but this proposition is less likely than my leaving.    the creditors and the bankruptcy judge are not that likely to approve good bonuses for performers, in my opinion.      We will be dogged with credit issues and lawsuits for a long time.		
 what do you think?
