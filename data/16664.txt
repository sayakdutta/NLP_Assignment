 ENA's outside counsel are aware.  I have been concerned, and continued to be 
 concerned about, the implications of being in the case, understanding that 
 our interests--and the stakes--are very high.  Continues to seem important 
 that we be in, but we'll need to discuss further, and make sure that Jim and 
 ENA's attorney's are in the loop.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 I think what Bob is trying to tell us, with this and another message I will 
 send you shortly, is that we can expect similar questions if we dip our toes 
 into the waters of this PUC case.  
 Jeff - this tells me we need ENA awareness/agreement ? with our going forward 
 in the CPUC case.
