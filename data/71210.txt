 Thanks.  I really appreciate all your good work, and will pass that along to 
 David Runnels and Paul Pipitone soon.

 Yesterday, Mike Sandridge faxed me an addition to the spare parts listed
 on Exhibit M-1.  The additional spare parts were "Lot Spare Bushings".
 However, the information he provided does not show the expected purchase
 lead time, which is provided for other items in Exhibit M-1.  It is a
 minor issue, but can I e-mail Mike directly for clarification, or would
 you have someone on the business team pass this along?
