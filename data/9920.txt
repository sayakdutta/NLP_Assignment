 Now would be a good time to remove any items from the refrigerators on 41. =
  There are only about 10 people left on 41 and there's still enough food an=
 d/or containers left here to feed a small country.  When everyone moves nex=
 t week anything left in the refrigerator is history!=20

 As you are well aware all of the ETS groups located on the 41st floor will =
 be relocated beginning this week and through part of next week.  Just a rem=
 inder, remove any food and/or containers that you have  in  either of the r=
 efrigerators in the 41st kitchen.  After 41 is vacated facilities departmen=
 t (a.k.a. hazardous waste) will be called to clean the refrigerator and dis=
 pose of all items left behind. =20
