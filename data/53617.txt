 Dear Dr. Kaminshi:
 
 I obtained your e-mail from Youyi Feng at Enron. I would like to bring to
 your attention the INFORMS Revenue Management conference that I am
 organizing at Columbia University with Prof. Garrett van Ryzin. You can find
 more information about the conference by following the link
 http://www.demingcenter.com/html_files/roi/roi_1stconf.htm. I truly hope you
 can attend.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 -Guillermo Gallego
