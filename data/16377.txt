 In response to the email distributed last  Fridayregarding IEP's intervention 
 in the EOB and CALPX price cap filings at  FERC, IEP is proceeding to draft 
 comments on the EOB filing.? Much of the  filing will build off arguements 
 used in the San Diego pleading as well as  comments IEP made to the 
 Congressional Subcommittee meetings in San  Diego.? In addition, IEP has 
 intervened for "party status" in the CALPX  proceeding on price caps.? 
 ?
 We plan to distrubute comments on  Thursday, convene a conference call 
 Friday, Sept. 15 at 10:00 a.m.  (PST).
 ?
 The Call-In Number is???  ??? ??? 800/205-3434
 The Participant Code  is?????????  111756
 ?
 IEP is still interested in receiving Task Force  commitments to assist in 
 restructuring/transmission related matters.?  While a numberr of companies 
 have indicated verbally their interest in the EOB  filing as well as others, 
 we have yet to receive a written confirmation.?  If you are interested, 
 please respond to the Friday email soliciting  funds.? Thanks.
