 Hi Vicek,
 Ludmila mentioned that you've got a promotion to a director level,
 but  more important, the decent salary raise.
 
 I am very happy for you and wishing you success on the new level.
 
 See you in Februry, perhaps both, Geoff and I, will be attending
 parents weekend at Stanford.
 
 Rita
