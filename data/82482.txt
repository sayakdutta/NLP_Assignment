 How did things go last night?  I hope everything went well. I went to Lane Bryant and did not find anything, but at least it was fun looking.  What is Hope's phone number.  I'm anxious to see a picture of that dress, (it better not make me look fatter!).  Write back when you have a chance.
  
     
 
 Well, I wouldn't have anyone to take care of my kids.  Siera has
 cheerleading practice from 6:30 - 7:45pm.  Afterwards, it'll be homework.
 They got to bed late last night and were extremely tired this morning.  I
 promised them they'd be in bed by 9 or 9:30 tonight.  I'll see what I can
 do.

 Tasha,
 
 I'm so sorry to hear that things are getting hectic again.  I definitely
 know what that feels like.  Do you think we could get away without the kids
 for an hour or so this evening?  Even if it's late..I need to see you and
 talk to you.  I still need to check with Todd to see if he's working
 tonight or what, but let's see what we can find out!
 
     
     

 
 
             
    Well Patrice, things at home are starting to get hectic again.  I really
    don't know what to do.  Steve's being very disrespectful again. He has
    threatened to kill me in front of Siera and for the first time, I'm
    scared.
    I feel that I've desperately wanted a happy family, home, etc... so bad,
    and now that I have this home, I don't know if it was the right thing to
    do.  I say this because I depleted almost all of my cash, and if he
    chooses
    not to contribute any $, I'll experience severe financial difficulties.
    This will push me to have to jump ship, just to get more money.  I don't
    know if I can go through this anymore.  I feel that staying with him has
    done more harm than good for me & the kids.  I don't know what more he
    could want from me.  I work, cook, clean, take care of him, the kids and
    what ever else.  He has a pretty easy life, thanks to the things that I
    do
    to make sure of that.   I'm afraid, and don't know what to do.
