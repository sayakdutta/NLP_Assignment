 Mike,
 
 I was talking to a member of the NYMEX Board and he thinks he can get JDF a 
 $5,000 to $10,000 donation from the NYMEX. I will coordinate with Cathy and 
 we will submit a request to the NYMEX and he will push the process. His name 
 is Rich Schaeffer and he is the NYMEX Treasurer and works at ABN AMRO in NY.
 
 Doug
