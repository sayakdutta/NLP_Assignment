 
 I received a faxed copy of the Customer Registration Form, Password 
 Application and Letter Agreement amending the ETA.  I expect the originals to 
 follow tomorrow.  I will have copies walked down to Lisa since the customer 
 is eager to start trading.  I will follow with the originals in the usual 
 course of business.
