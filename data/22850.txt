 a problem for everyone but I can never open these attachments from 
 Braeswell.  Can you please send a hard copy.
 
 Regards
 Delainey

 Dave -- Kevin has asked that we do a full-blown protest of HQ's continuation 
 of market based rates due to market manipulating behavior that Tom May has 
 seen.  Due 11/30.  Let us know if we should not proceed with the OASIS 
 review, etc. and drafting of protest.  Thanks.
