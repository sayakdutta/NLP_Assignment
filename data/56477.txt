 Vince:
 
 Michael Crew would like you to be a speaker on Wednesday, May 23rd
 instead of the 24th at the Rutgers Conference.  Is this ok?
 
 He is preparing the agenda and needs to know as soon as possible.

 Shirley,
 
 This is to follow up today's conversation with Anita.  As mentioned Paul 
 Kleindorfer invited Vince to be our dinner speaker on Thursday, May 24.  On 
 reflection given the strong line up for Wednesday - Fred Kahn et al - we 
 would very much like Vince to be the speaker on Wednesday.  This will 
 conclude the day very well giving participants a strong incentive to be there 
 for the Wednesday. 
 
 I gather that this change should be acceptable to Vince.  
 
 We will show Vince's name as follows:
 
  
 
 Wincety J. Kaminski
 
 Managing Director - Research
 
 ENRON
 
 
 
 Jeremy will be em ailing you the program with this information immediately.
 
 
 We would like to go to press today.  Failing that we can go to press 
 tomorrow.  We would very much appreciate your confirming this and making any 
 corrections or changes.  If you would respond to all of us it would be 
 appreciated.
