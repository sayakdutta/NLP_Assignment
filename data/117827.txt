 
 I can't believe you have to change planes in Chicago AND Dallas!  I don't 
 remember you being that willing to suffer for a cheaper ticket.
 
 Bummer - looks like I'll just have to be the wimp this time.  There's really 
 no way I can get away next week.  I have heard of las ventanas - but I didn't 
 know about the evian spritzing.
 
 Maybe next time.  Any more thoughts on a week that works for sailing?  I 
 could spring for a bottle of evian and a plant mister......
