 
 Are there year-end deals?  If yes, how will they be covered?  Let me know.  
 Thanks.   Mark

 I am planning to be out of the office from Dec 15 through January 2 on 
 vacation/home leave.  During this time, I will be available by telephone (my 
 U.S. cellphone number is 917-971-0606) and I will have access to email.
 
 Regards,
  John
