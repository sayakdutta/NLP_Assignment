 
 Sorry, I missed your call.
 I was to busy being sarcastic about ENE!
 
 How about 6:00 PM.
 I can go for a run beforehand.
 I picked the time so you have to pick the place.
 
  
     
 Yes - what time ?
 
  
     
 Hi There!
 
 I hope you had a nice Birthday celebration?
 I went to New Orleans last weekend.
 It was nice to relax after such a stressful week!
 I did fall in "LOVE" Friday night but I think it was one of those one day viruses?
 It was a nice feeling!
 
 Are we still on for Wednesday night?
 It still works for me!
 
 I hope all is well!

 Thanks !  I knew it was short notice.
 The big ol 35 -- but you can say 28.
 Next Wednesday sounds good to me - let's plan on it.
 What do you think of all this Enron stuff ?
 
  
     
 Happy Birthday!
 Sounds like a fun time.
 I have a dentist appt out by the house at 4:00 pm so I will have to opt for dinner next week!
 Hope you have a fun night celebrating your ah? 28 birthday, right?
 Call when you figure out what's good for you.  Wednesday looks best for me right now.

 Hey !  What has been going on ?  We never did make it to dinner.  
 I booked a last minute trip to the Islands two weeks ago and ran into Legler at the airport -- they were headed to France and their gate was 
 next to ours.  
 Anyways, if you get a chance - I thought the below would be a good way to see you and catch up or even get to see some of the old gang.
 Hope you can make it - and if not, let's do dinner sometime next week ?
