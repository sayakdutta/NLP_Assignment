 
 This confirmation should have the regular Omnibus Annex A attached as well as 
 the additional Chilean Annex which Tana forwarded last week.  Please call me 
 if you have any questions.

 I received from Derek Bailey the Confirmation Form  and the Chilean Annex, 
 but I feel there is still missing the Annex A, as it is  refferred in the 
 Confirmation Form as part of the terms and conditions of the  transaction. 
 Please confirm.
