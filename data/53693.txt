 No luck yet. I could not find the issue
 you are looking for.
 We are reorganizing our group library
 and all magazines are in one big pile.
 I should know  by Friday if we still have it.

 I know how busy you are but I was wondering if you had any luck in
 finding the 1996 Risk Magazine Article we discussed.  Thanks.
