 
 I just spoke with Clark Smith, head of Elpaso's merchant arm.  I told him 
 that we had been hearing that El Paso was blaming Enrononline for problems in 
 Western gas markets.  He asked for some more specifics about who exactly was 
 spreading the rumor (I told him we had heard it from 3-4 sources).  He 
 acknowledged that EOL was not the problem; said he couldn't believe that it 
 had been identified as such; and said he would bring it up on his call with 
 his Washington team this afternoon.
 
 I think he will put it to rest (except for whatever damage has already been 
 done).  I did promise to get some more specifics on who has told us that El 
 Paso pointed to us.  Can anybody give some info on that?
