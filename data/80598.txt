 Dear Mr. McConnell:
 
 Your organization's fees for 2000-2001 ISRC membership have not been paid. A
 copy of the invoice, dated August 15, 2000 is attached for your information.
 Would you kindly look into it and help us to get this settled?
 
 We appreciate your support of the ISRC.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Dan Currie
 
 P.S. Don't forget our November 16 event on the implications of a Microsoft
 breakup. We'll see you there.
