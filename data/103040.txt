 I am suprised at how little the bare bones employee and the full package employee trips differ in price!
 
 I wanna do the 19 grand package. Employees and Spouses. Do for us but do the works.
 
 I think it would be a welcome perk in a weary office right now.

 Attached is a spreadsheet indicating pricing for a Customer Ski Trip, as well as several pricing options for an In-house trip.   
 
 The dinner priced for the in-house trip would be either a pizza and salad buffet or a Mexican fiesta buffet.  The meal selected for the Customer event is a Western Bar-B-Que.
 
 Mt.Bachelor is debuting a tubing hill this year, and I have requested a group price quote for that activity.  I'll let you all know what I find out, but it sounds like a blast.
 
 If you have any questions, give me a call. (7698).
