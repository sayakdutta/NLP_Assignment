 
 Ask Julie to play with us.  I could play Sunday if that would be better.
 
  
     
 I should be able to....(this is Steve)...however,   I will need to check
 with Julie to make sure no plans have been set yet (i.e. kids
 soccer..etc..).   I will fax over the tee time request to ensure we lock a
 time.  Thanks.
 
 Steve
