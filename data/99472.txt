 The AG subpoena requests copies of organization charts for EES and Enron Wholesale's trading group.  The time period specified is October 1, 1999 to the present.  These may exist as slides used in presentations to the Enron Corp. Board.  Mike Kirby wants to offer them to the AG as a show of good faith to the judge.  Is it okay to disclose these?
 
 P.S.  Rebecca, since our discussion, I clarified that organization charts for only EES and EWS trading are covered by the subpoena.
