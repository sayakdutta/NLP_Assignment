 Last week FERC staff recommended to the full commission that the FR contrac=
 ts be converted to CD contracts, in effect abrogating a huge chunk of the o=
 riginal 1996 El Paso settlement.  The indicated shippers last year did file=
  a Section 5 complaint against El Paso, accusing the pipeline of over selli=
 ng its capacity.  This debate has been one of the biggest hindrances in get=
 ting shippers to commit to the Sun Devil project.

 You may know this, but I thought I'd pass it on since it was mostly new to =
 me.
 
 El Paso has two types of firm customers, which are CD (contract demand) and=
  FR (full requirements) customers. FR customers are allowed to schedule an =
 amount up to their full meter capacity as long as capacity is available. Ho=
 wever, FR customers pay El Paso a fixed reservation charge and  volumes exc=
 eeding FR quantities are billed El Paso's usage rate. FR customer loads hav=
 e increased rapidly in the last few years as growth in the states east of C=
 alifornia has surged. With these increased loads the FR customers have been=
  getting a tremendous deal since they pay only the usage charge on incremen=
 tal volumes exceeding their FR quantities. FR customers argue that they are=
  entitled to this benefit since they bargained for it in EL Paso's last rat=
 e proceeding. El Paso's last settlement was similar to TW's in that custome=
 rs agreed to certain benefits in exchange for paying higher rates to resolv=
 e capacity turnback issues. The FR customer's good deal is a problem becaus=
 e 1) FR customer's increased volumes have led to capacity prorations making=
  it more difficult for other shippers to get cheaper San Juan gas, 2) these=
  prorations in conjunction with the scheduling cycles make it difficult for=
  shippers to get scheduled, 3) El Paso has no financial incentive to expand=
  because the FR customers will use the capacity and pay only the usage rate=
 , and 4) the FR customers ability to take gas has prevented El Paso from of=
 fering services such as park and loan and storage service that other custom=
 ers want. Absent FERC action, FR customers will retain the benefits of the =
 settlement until El Paso's next rate case in 2006.
 
 The Commission is threatening to initiate a Section 5 proceeding to address=
  capacity allocation issues on El Paso and has directed Staff to convene a =
 technical conference next month to address these issues (see March 18, 2002=
  Inside FERC).  The conference probably won't occur until at least late Apr=
 il because El Paso is bogged down in their market abuse proceeding.
