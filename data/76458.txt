 Brett is meeting with me in my office at 1:30 p.m. Houston time to discuss 
 the closing.   Please let me know if you can be there; Melba is trying to 
 find a conf. room if the response is good.   If you cannot attend, but can be 
 available by phone, please let me know that also; I can get a conf. call set 
 up.    
 
 Luiz - are you in SP or Rio today?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Rose
