 Michelle, any and all help on this one would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks, Cole.
  
     
 
 
  
     
 Tim, a new kind of question.  Can you run this one by Michelle?
 
  
     
 With all of the losses and their tax implications, is there a company resource we can use for information rather than struggling to find information ourselves?
