 
 The Joint Defense Agreement looks good,except for the application of Florida 
 law. Have you looked at Fla. law?
 
 With respect to limitations on possible claims, you have a good point. Please 
 look at the limitations issue in light of what you know. An extensive review 
 of the depositions doesn't seem warranted to me. I would also suggest we 
 enter into a Tolling Agreement w/ Power systems ASAP. Call me to 
 discuss--853-5587

 Attached is the Joint Defense Agreement from Shook, Hardy & Bacon with my 
 comments in redline. This agreement was sent to us to allow Enron access to 
 the Power Systems' attorney's opinion regarding whether the proposed redesign 
 for the New Albany and Doyle turbines might infringe GE patents.
 
 My comments are intended to preserve Enron's rights to bring any claims that 
 it may have against Power Systems. Do we have any other agreements of this 
 type with Power Systems?  Some claims that Enron may have against Power 
 Systems such as claims for breach of warranty may have limitations periods 
 that are approaching.  I believe we have discussed having Bracewell review 
 the depositions and any documents related to the installation of the 
 allegedly infringing systems into Enron's facilities.  Please advise if you 
 would like for us to undertake this review and ensure that any claims that 
 Enron may have are protected.
 
 Thanks.
