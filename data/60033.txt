 We are coming over to get our green card done - hopefully anyway. We will be in London 27th - 30th of January - are you around?
 
 Can't wait to see Camille and Alice.

 Happy new year!!!   Hope you had a nice  Xmas and new year.  Thank you so much for lovely presents.  Alice  adores her frog...it's a great idea.  When are you coming over?  We  are off to Megeve ( I think...) from the 15th March, kids at ski  school/creche.  We can fit more people into flat if you are in the  area.  
  
 Later alligator
