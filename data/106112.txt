 the Schedule (as an "Additional Event of Default") with respect to the 
 disappearance of a credit rating from either S&P or Moody's (or both) based 
 on your usage in power masters?  
 
 I believe that we agreed that for purposes of the CSA (when S&P and Moody's 
 are indicated on the credit worksheet), both ratings must disappear to 
 trigger the MAC.
 
 For purposes of an Additional Event of Default, should we just pose the 
 question to credit?

 It should say either; therefore, if one were to disappear, an Event of 
 Default would occur.  This was the intent and is probably consistent with 
 that in the Master Power agmt.
 
 
 
  
     
 Ed:  For the Additional Event of Default (ratings trigger), do you intend the 
 MAC to apply when only one or both credit ratings disappear?
