 Sorry it took so long but the spring break weekends missed me up. Laser
 Quest is located at 13711 Westheimer between Eldridge
 and Highway 6
 Hours are:
 Tuesday thru
 Thursday           6 to 10
 Friday               4 to 12
 Saturday          12 to 12
 Sunday            12 to 8
 
 We can reserve a twenty minute slot with ten or more for $6.50 per person or
 $7.50 if less then ten.
 
 I suggest we meet their Sunday April 1 at 5 o'clock then get a bite to eat
 afterwards. Please confirm if you plan to be there or not so I can make
 reservations.
