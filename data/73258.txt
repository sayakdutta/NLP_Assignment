 Michael was admitted to MD Anderson late last night for the start of chemo
 (4 days of it), followed by the bone marrow transplant next Monday.  He's in
 isolation (for his own protection), and - so far - seems to be doing OK.
 What a way to spend one's 25th birthday (tomorrow)!  Well, he probably is
 taking it in stride as he's spent a Christmas and New Year's in the hospital
 already.
 
 If you've been praying for him, keep it up.  And thank you.  And if you
 haven't started, now would be a great time to begin.

 PS There was news last week about the FDA approving a new drug for leukemia
 treatment.  Unfortunately, it's for a different kind of leukemia than what
 Michael has.
