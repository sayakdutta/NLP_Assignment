 Hello Dorie,
 
 I know this is not the most opportune time, but we have a final decision on
 the suite pricing.  This special rate was more than 50% off of the original
 pricing for just one bedroom.  It was something negotiated between
 ourselves and we can't justify a lower rate on a sold out night for Mr.
 Lavorato when he continued to stay in the suite.  This might be different
 had he moved to a regular room and we could have upsold someone else to the
 suite.   However, we had to walk away from that revenue.    I hope Mr.
 Lavorato understands our business position.  Please contact me if you have
 any questions.
