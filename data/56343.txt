 We are looking forward to having you here.
 If you want, you can stop by one day and I shall introduce you
 to Grant Masson with whom you will be working this summer.

 Hi Dr. Kaminski,
 
 Yesterday, I learned from Shannon Rogers at the associate-analyst program
 that I was offered a summer associate/internship position in your group. I
 am already very excited about this position and look forward to working in
 your group. Many thanks for your consideration.
