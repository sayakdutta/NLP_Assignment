 
 Elise,
 
 Thanks for the email.  In August i changed jobs and am now the CEO for Enron 
 Global Markets.  I am no longer in the technology sector (although I enjoyed 
 it very much and it was a difficult decision to leave).  Please remove me 
 from your email list for further HTC events.
 
 Thanks and good luck,
 mike
