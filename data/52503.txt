 have experience and exposure at all stages of investments: seed stage,
 venture capital, private equity, and secondary markets. My interest in
 energy is manifest in studying and applying valuation methodologies to fuel
 cell companies. You can expect my very proactive involvement in your
 organization, a trait I cultivated working for and with startup companies.
