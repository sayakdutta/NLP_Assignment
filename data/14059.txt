 I have been asked to coordinate messaging and communication between the HR generalists and the Enron Human Resource Transition Coordination Team.  To that end, we will have an update meeting TODAY for HR Generalists to discuss activities that have occurred over the last few days and to ensure all of you have the same level of knowledge.  Your attendance is important to ensure the seamless flow of information across business lines.
