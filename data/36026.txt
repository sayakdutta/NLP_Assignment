 As part of our monthly testing, we review the monthly Natural Gas P & L 
 Statement and identify specific regions for which we would like to review 
 additional documentation.  Please find below, the regions that we have 
 identified.  We are requesting that you supply the P & L top pages for the 
 last day of the month for those regions that are applicable to you.  Once we 
 have reviewed these top pages, we will be contacting you to discuss the 
 drivers of these regions.  Please let me know if you have any questions or 
 comments.  As of February 28th, Arthur Andersen employees will no longer have 
 access to Enron Lotus Notes.  I am asking that all correspondence please be 
 sent to my Arthur Andersen Lotus Notes account at 

 
 Thank You,
