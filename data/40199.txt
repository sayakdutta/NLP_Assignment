 
 Tim said you were having a problem using our harvester to get 
 companys/entities' ATC that aren't complying with FERC's OASIS requirements.  
 Tim suggested that I help you resolve this.  Could you make me a list of 
 companies/entities that aren't complying?  Then we could discuss how to 
 address the problem with each company/entity.
 
 Tim suggested that, to the extent we want companies to comply, we could call 
 them and ask them to comply.  If they don't I suggested we could call the 
 FERC hotline on a confidential basis.
