 
 by this ratio the rest ot the power group is really underperforming!!!!
 
 
 
 
     
 
 This 250K came from about 3 MW.
  
     
 We tried all day to sell this volume below.  Market is extremely illiquid, 
 given Annex V uncertainty and other regulatory issues: generators believe 
 Parente will help them out in May, while LDCs look at their contracts and 
 reduced demand.  However AES Sul accepted to buy this volume at 25% discount 
 to May spot price, payment on June 25th.  We will net about R$600,000 
 (US$250,000) between sale and purchase prices.  Credit is OK.
 
 We will keep a very small, long position at MAE settlement for May.

 This is to inform that we have closed 2.200 MWh for May to AES Sul at 25% 
 discount rate against spot price at southeast sub-market to be paid on Jun 
 25th.
