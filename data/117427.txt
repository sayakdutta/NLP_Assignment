 If you look at the attached list we are due to make a lot of these dates in 
 the next two weeks.  The biggest problem in Europe is probably that Edmund is 
 obviously out of the office and there are no dates even for his.
 
 These delays are causing chicken and egg problems with the metals customers.  
 We can't mail if there are no pas etc.  The big metals roll-out is in London 
 first week in October so we do need them by then,
 
 If there are re-prioritisation issues please contact Bruce Garner who needs 
 them for that week.
 
 Please let me know. 
 
 Thanks
 
 Louise
