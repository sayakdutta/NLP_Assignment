 Since I have been processing the Webley invoices over the last 3 months I've 
 have noticed that many of you don't have any or only have very little usage 
 on your accounts.   The purpose of this e-mail is to see how many of you want 
 to keep your telephone assistant services and who wants to discontinue the 
 service, since most of the Webley charges are only service charges and very 
 little or no usage.
 
 
 Thanks,
