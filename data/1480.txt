 As noted in my  last e-mail, the Ray Nixon expansion project in Colorado had 
 the incorrect start date.  My last report showed an online date of May 2001; 
 the actual anticipated online date is May 2003.
  
 The following list ranks the quality and quantity of information that I have 
 access to in the WSCC:
 
  1) CA - siting office, plant contacts
  2) PNW - siting offices, plant contacts
  3) DSW - plant contacts, 1 siting office for Maricopa County Arizona.
  4) Colorado - Integrated Resource Plan
 
 If anyone has additional information regarding new generation in the Desert 
 Southwest or Colorado, such as plant phone numbers or contacts, I would 
 greatly appreciate receiving this contact information.
