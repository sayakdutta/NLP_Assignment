 
 FYI.  Just got a call from someone inside McKenzie & Co..  Seems the good 
 Governor has figured out that the gas industry is a problem and want to talk 
 to me about it.  I'm scheduled to talk to them by phone Friday at 1:30.  I 
 called Kari Dohn to try to find out more.  She told me that they've figured 
 out that the gas industry is a mess, that "McKenzie gets it," and she asked 
 to tell it like it is.  Seems useful to get our view across to them.  The 
 name of the person from McKenzie that will be on the call with the Davis 
 folks on Friday is Daniel Poller.  Thoughts?
 
 Best,
 Jeff
