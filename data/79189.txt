 FYI
 
 While I have been periodically giving updates on the above max rate capacity release activity, I was surprised by the magnitude of the PG&E value above max. rates.
 For the 12 months ended 9/30/01 we had net cash payments to PG&E.  (approx $18 mil revenues to Cal.  + $5.6 revenue on San Juan - $28 million in above max rate capacity release activity = ($4.4) million
