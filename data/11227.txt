 do care that a troubled situation receive the attention it requires to avoid 
 getting in deeper. There always seems to be reluctance in UK to have a dash 
 prepared, Steve always used a huge amount of energy on justifying the task. 
 We all know that if problem deals are not addressed they always get worse. 
 Maybe Michael could be led to "suggest" an alternative memo or approach. A 
 "problem deal" memo. If you all think a dash is the best approach do it and I 
 don't care if they don't sign it.
 
 Once the website is functional, it will be helpful to have a complete history 
 of deals and having these kind of memos in dash format will aid this process. 
 
 One final thought, Michael is quite supportive of our effort and I think we 
 should pick battles carefully. Rick
