 Russell, pls set up credit terms for customer for transactions under the 
 physical, which may include pricing amemdments. i.e. the MTM risk may sit 
 under the physical agreement.  
 
 At this time, we are not going to pursue the execution of a deemed ISDA and 
 any price amendments will be handled physicaly. 
 
 Call if there are any questions.
