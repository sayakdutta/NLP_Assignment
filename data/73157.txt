 
 Well, here's the nearly final draft of what was submitted.  Evidently, we 
 decided to submit a bid on the original transaction structure, as well as two 
 alternatives. (not what I was lead to believe before.)  I spoke with John 
 about adding more disclaimer language to the letter to say that by submitting 
 the bid we aren't agreeing to enter into a transaction or even negotiate for 
 a transaction.  Also, I advised him that the confidentiality statements in 
 the letter were not great protection.
