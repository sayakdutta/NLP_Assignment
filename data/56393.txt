 Vince/Stinson:
 
 I just came back from a meeting with Accounting (Ryan Siueck) and Credit (Rod 
 Nelson - works with Bill Bradford) in which we presented the two-factor model 
 for calculating credit loss on our LJM's position. Rod seemed positive with 
 the model conceptual approach. He will position Bill Bradford on that. 
 Accounting will have a meeting with AA to discuss the treatment on credit 
 reserves on this deal tomorrow 9:00 AM. They feel my participation is not 
 necessary. 
 
 At year-end the difference on both valuations - without and with credit risk 
 - indicates a credit loss of about 100 MM.
