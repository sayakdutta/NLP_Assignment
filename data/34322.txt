 Chris--
 Have you called Charlie yet with bids on the three CES transport contracts we 
 discussed?   
 Also, have you received from CES the official in writing notification of 
 their withdrawal from certain c&i markets?
 
 I want to make sure we have enough time to handle all the transportation 
 contract issues, etc. for June bid week.  Please advise.
