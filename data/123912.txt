 I had heard that Zhiyun was sent home today but Norman and some others stayed
 
  
     
 I was in a meeting last night to discuss who was critical.  I do not know if that list has been blessed.  The list we put together would definitely get us a through especially since we will not have all the old deals.  Your normal contacts should be there - Norman, Zhiyun, Min, Duong Luu, Will Smith.
