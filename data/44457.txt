 Dan,
 
 A couple of changes need to be made:
 
 ? Les thought we should add Enron LNG Marketing LLC as a signature party.  
 Will having just ENA cover us?  If not, do we need to have both ENA and Enron 
 LNG be named throughout the document?
 ? typo on Southern on 2nd and 3rd page titles.
 
  
  
    Cc: Demoes, Phil; Webber, Les
  
 Phil DeMoes asked me to forward the attached subject agreement to you.
