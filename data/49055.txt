    programming, and the energy industry? (that's right, all four...)
 
 Vince,
 
 Following your eSpeak session, Erin Rice suggested I contact you about 
 joining your group.  I have been with EES for almost three years, and during 
 that time I have worked on tasks that are similar to what your group does on 
 a larger scale.  Specifically, I excel at analytical/quantitative problem 
 solving and the development of models and user requirements for application 
 development.  My educational background is energy management, and I have 
 recently become involved in the financial aspects of transactions.  I have 
 attached my resume for your review, and I hope you will call me so we can 
 talk in person.
 
 Thank you.
