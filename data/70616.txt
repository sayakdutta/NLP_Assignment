 
 The word is that giving the notice could put the equipment on the balance 
 sheet.  If the Coral deal didn't close, the equipment would be tainted.  
 Therefore, the giving of the notice needs to occur after we feel certain that 
 the Coral transaction will close.
 
 The assignment and assumption agreement have been reviewed by Rob Taylor, and 
 he thinks the agreement is fine.

 Kay,
 
 I will be out of the office for the next two days (Tuesday and Wednesday).  
 We are in the process of getting the DASH signed -- Rebecca Walker will be 
 pursuing signatures tomorrow.
 
 The other outstanding issues are the Option Notice, the Assignment Agreement 
 and an agreement with Coral. Have we received an update regarding the Option 
 Notice from Rob Taylor?  
 
 Rebecca needs to know when to send the wire transfer by 2:00 PM on the day 
 before any funds need to be sent.  In addition, we do need to give WLB at 
 least two days notice of any wire transfer (formally 5 days, but Rose 
 Engeldorff indicated that we should be OK with 2 days).
 
  If you have any questions, you may contact me at 713-516-5409 for the next 
 two days.  I will be back in the office on Thursday.
 
 
 Best regards,
 Raimund D. Grube
