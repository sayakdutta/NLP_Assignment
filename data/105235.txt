 In connection with our disussion regarding Market Quotation and "Reference 
 Market - makers" in the Schedule (specifically Enron's request to delete 
 clause (b) to the Section 12 definition), I am advised that it would be 
 difficult to locate four leading dealers with offices in the same city.  With 
 respect to the outstanding trades, for example, we would like to know which 
 city has  four leading dealers  for quoting Mid-Columbia prices?  Please let 
 us know.  Thanks.  Sara
