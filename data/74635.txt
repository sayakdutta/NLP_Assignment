 
 I feel bad.  I'll at least leave a message for him this weekend.
 
 
 
 


   
  
 He has left town by now. They are going to a wedding in College Sta. and
 will not be back until Sunday. I told him e-mail was the best way to talk to
 you. He said he would try to call one time and if he didn't reach you it
 wasn't a big deal.
 Any more thoughts on what you would like to do tonight?

 Larry left me a voice mail.  Would you mind calling him and telling him
 that I am tied up on a conference call that is likely to last until 500, so
 I can't call him until after then.
 
 I would really appreciate it!!!!!!!!
