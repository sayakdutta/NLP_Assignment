 
 FYI when  we put in a new deal in sitara we only update the volume section(top section of sitara).  We do not touch the expected volumes area - that is for schedulers to make changes and modify.  Please shout with any questions.

 We ask you please  to make any changes to a Sitara deals in the "Expected Volumes Line" instead of in the "Exchange Line" - examples are deal #s 942169, 941625, 933260, 933212, 933146, 933086.
 
 If you have any questions please let me know. We appreciate your help !
 
 Thanks,
