 God bless and  have a nice day!
 
 "Father, I ask you to bless my friends, relatives
 and email buddies reading this right now.
 Show them a new revelation of your love
 and power.  Holy Spirit, I ask you to minister
 to their spirit at this very moment.
 Where there is pain, give them your peace and mercy.
 Where there is self-doubt, release a renewed
 confidence through your grace, In Jesus precious Name."
 Amen
