 Anne and David,
    Apparently some or all of my TAC group are on the "lay off" list, effective today.  We are working on a project that will require their presence until at least next week, longer for some.  
   For now, please ensure the following 9 individuals are on the RETAIN notice until further notice:
 1)  Chris Clark
 2)  Angie Wingo
 3)  Jason Loup
 4)  Junichi Sugiura
 5)  Brian Mihura
 6)  Richard Boehm
 7)  Dan Orbeck
 8)  Don Chancey
 9)  Ken Kooser 
 
 Thanks,
 Scott THolan
