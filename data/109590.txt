 
 Pam, I was going through Jeff's email and found this.  See below - it looks 
 like this went to Catherine Brown of EES (my name is with a "K").  It looks 
 like Jeff would be available from 2:00 to 3:00.  I will put it on his 
 calendar to attend for one hour.  Is that good for you? 
 Katherine

 Thanks - Pam
