 
 Remi, Dave:
 
 
 First of all I want to thank you for your hospitality and to apologize
 for a delay in responding to you. It was quite a tumultuous week
 and the turbulence continues.
 
 The outline of commitments with the information on what I have done to 
 jumpstart the process.
 
 1.	Review of the CEPEL model / simplified model. Chonawee
 started the review process, with the help of our two native Portuguese speakers.
 Less complicated/faster to run model will follow.
 
 2.	SDDP. As you know Tom Halliburton is in Norway this week.
 They put their grimy fingers on him first.
 He will be back next week and will help you  to set up the SDDP runs.
 He even volunteer to stay on the job for a few days longer to help
 you with the project.
 
 3.	Transmission modeling. Martin Lin will call Dave to jumpstart the process.
 
 4.	Zimin will call David regarding swing option model, option pricing models
 for non-standard distributions and truncated distributions.
 
 5.	Cooperation with the SA University in the area of the weather research 
 	Remains to be discussed with Jose and Mike.
