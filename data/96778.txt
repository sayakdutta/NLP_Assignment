 I can play on Wed night if you need somebody.  Also would love to hit on Sat but maybe in a proam tournament at the Met (if that falls apart I might call you and see if you need another body).  Talk to you soon.

 Will you be able to play Wednesday (9/12) at Memorial Park?  We will have 2
 people playing at 7 and 2 at 8:15.  Let me know if you can make it.
 
 Cindy
