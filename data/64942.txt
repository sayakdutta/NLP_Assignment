 
 it is probably the second or third most important day of the year behind 
 jesus's birthday and maybe superbowl sunday.  i had to throw a football 
 reference in there.   my bad, 830 is a lot earlier than 9.  i think it is 
 still dark at that hour.  well i would love to continue this fascinating 
 dicussion but i need to get ready to play liar's poker.  i need to win some 
 money so we don't have to wash dishes after we eat tonight.  see you at 830.
