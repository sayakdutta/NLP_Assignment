 
 I'm stuck on a phone call until about 5.  I think you ought to take it up to 
 Paul and Rod and if they want it out today, get Rod to sign it.  I havn't 
 heard back from Steve Harris so let Rod decide what to do.  Thanks.  DF

 Drew   Paul cherry's number is 713 853-6409.
 Do you want me to print it out and have Rod sign since Steve is not here 
 today??
