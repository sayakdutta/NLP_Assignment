 Here's the way to claim your Internet fees as part of the ClickAtHome Canada program.   Internet fees are reimbursed through payroll with the final processing date being December 15th .  Below are the simple steps to claim your Internet fees  up to December 31, 2001 :
 
 (1)  Enter your Internet payment information on the "Clickathome.enron.com/canada" site.  This initially registers you as an Internet user in the ClickAtHome Canada program and then provides the appropriate information to our accounting department for payment.   You can include your Internet fees from the commencement of the program (June 5, 2001) or for pilot program participants from your commencement date to December 31, 2001. 
 
 (2)  Please complete the first step by  December 15th so your claim can be processed and paid on  December 30th through payroll.   
 
 (3)  Kindly retain a copy of all your claimed receipts as back-up in the event you are asked by Calgary Accounting to provide it. 
 
 ** Can't remember your SAP number??  Use this handy site:  <http://isc.enron.com> (follow the instructions for 'SAP or eHRonline password reset' and then 'click here if you have forgotten your personnel number').   Use your SIN number where it asks for Social Security Number and your all set.
 
 If you need assistance with your registration or have questions about your Internet subsidy, kindly contact  Tricia Henry.
