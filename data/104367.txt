 Attached are the swap forms we have utilized in round one of the raptor off 
 balance sheet swap project.  I have tried to clean them, and have also 
 incorporated comments received thus far from Kirkland & Ellis, firm for 
 Talon.  Please review these forms and provide any further comments or 
 suggestions to them by Tuesday morning of next week.   As I mentioned, we 
 plan to forward to you proposal sheets as and when received for all the 
 remaining swaps to be placed into the raptor vehicles for preparation of the 
 swaps by your firm.  We should know more about the timing of the next round 
 of swaps next week.  As other and varied investments may be placed in the 
 vehicles, we will ask that your firm develop the forms to be used on the 
 basis of the proposals and any documents applicable to the underlying 
 investment.  Finally, please finalize the memorandum on termination and 
 forward to my attention next week, if possible.
 
 Thank you for your continued assistance.  Please confirm receipt and ability 
 to have comments to me by Tuesday.
