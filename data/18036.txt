 Hey Jeff.  I've got the details on the RGA meeting and am working with Rosie 
 on that, so when you get a chance, give me a buzz and we can compare notes.  
 I will fax you info so you know location/time/etc.  I'm also focused on 
 getting 15-30 minutes of time that afternoon for Ken Lay to talk with John 
 Rowe (co chair of Exelon) on open access/FERC positions.

 I got a voicemail fro Ken.  He would be happy to meet with Freeman.  He is 
 willing to work on other times, but suggested the following
 After 3:00 on May 2nd (right after Ken's speech to the RGA) or late the day 
 before or in the morning of the second (to do this though he would have to 
 cancel his speech to the Texas Governor's business council but he is willing 
 to do this if necessary)
 His least preferred alternative in this general time frame would be early 
 morning on the third.
 Jeff -- could you coordinate with Rosie to get the time and place nailed down?
