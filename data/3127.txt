 you shaped the forward vol and price curves at each level.  My VAR is so 
 dependent on spread levels and vols that a small change in the Jan vols could 
 produce that effect.  
 The results certainly provide evidence of a need for higher VAR going into 
 the winter.

 The below file shows the results of the two stress test requested.  Under the 
 $7 dollar stress, NYMEX curve was shifted to $7 dollars with all other price 
 curves proportionally shifted.  Under the $9 dollar test, not only were the 
 price curves shifted, but volatilites were stressed as well with NYMEX 
 volatility going to 100% and all other vol locations being raised accordingly.
 
 
 Key findings include:
 $7 dollar stress only raised VaR by 79%  
 $9 dollar stress raised VaR by 134% 
 
        
 
 It is interesting to note that with the seven dollar stress, VaR on the 
 financial desk actually decreased.  This would seem to imply that up to the 
 seven dollar strike, the financial desk is long gamma (which overall reduces 
 risk).  But between the seven dollar and nine dollar strike, it appears that 
 the desk becomes short gamma, thereby acceralatering the amount of risk and 
 increasing VaR by 74%.  Does this make sense or is something else happening?

 Attached below are the $7 and $9 stresses that were run at the request of 
 Lavo ($7) and Arnold ($9).  I ran the results against the AGG-IV portfolio.
