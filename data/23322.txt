 
 Nancy and Tom, I received notice today that a company of which I am a director has scheduled a special board meeting for this Friday afternoon on the east coast.  I will be unable, therefore, to be in Austin for the Executive Committee Meeting.  Please convey my regrets and best wishes to those who attend.  All the best.  Jim
