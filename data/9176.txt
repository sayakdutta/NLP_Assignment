 
 I didn't know about this one.  I'm going to follow up with Brent on this one 
 and I will get back to you in a day or so.  We'll save the Scott Mills 
 discussion for a later date! 
 
 On another note, I enjoyed lunch today.  Let me know when you want to get out 
 of the building again sometime.  --Sally

 Brent Price just stole Jennifer Denny - no discussion or anything.  So I 
 obviously will get Scott Mills in return!
