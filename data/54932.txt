 
 Toni,
 
 We shall be meeting Rabi for lunch to discuss the offer and the details of his
 job with him. Let's wait  for the outcome of this discussion.

 FYI,  I do not send out a written offer package until the verbal offer issues 
 are resolved and a final offer is made.   So, I'd like to put the details 
 below in writing and send out to him  for Tuesday delivery.     I'm playing 
 phone tag with him regarding the other details and will follow up with him 
 again in the morning. 
 
 Thanks
 Toni 
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
   
  
 Toni:
 
 We talked to Rabi. He's sitting on the fence for some good reasons, and he 
 has to weigh what is fairly comfy job situation for one that starts out at a 
 lower level but has more potential.   WRT the GREEN, Vince verbally offered 
 salary of $105k plus a guarantee that his bonus at year end would be a 
 minimum of $15k cash.  That's in addition to the $15k sign on bonus.  Vince 
 said that we would not bother working up a revised offer letter unless and 
 until Rabi came back with a verbal ok.  He will ponder the offer; probably 
 for a few more days and get back with us.  He may well call you to discuss 
 the exact details of the benefits.  ESOP, 401(k) contributions, etc.
 
 
 Regards,
 Grant.
