 Tim/Michelle:  To follow-up on our meeting yesterday...I received a call from one of my clients, Takiyah Gordon, regarding her maternity leave status.  She had her baby on November 14th and will be under a doctor's care until January.  She informed me that she also received the news that she will not qualify for unemployment while under a doctor's care.  Please advise.  Thanks.
