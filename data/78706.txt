 
 The balance due to GE is being escrowed at closing, with standing 
 instructions to release payments to GE on a fixed payment schedule.  I will 
 email you the current draft of the instructions.

 This financing transaction is much more "involved" than others. I know
 nothing about Pegasus Power or Salmon.  What comfort are we getting that we
 will get paid.  Is there an LOC in place.  Are there guarantees to back up
 these debt financing.  Is GE secured in preference to this debt.

 Hi Kent,
 
 I can get a redline done for you if you want to tell me what it should be
 redlined against.
 
 I don't know about getting rid of the requirement for the inhouse counsel
 opinion.  Maybe after you look at things we can discuss it.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay

      Attached please find the latest Salmon Energy Turbine Agreement
 (second document below), as well as a blackline (first document below)
 showing changes made to the version circulated last Friday.  Pursuant to
 your instructions, the performance values in Article 10 are per the 24
 Unit master agreement.  In addition no changes have been made to the
 Maximum or Unit Liability Amounts or payment schedule. To complete the
 agreement, we will need to insert the date of execution and Exhibit H-2.
