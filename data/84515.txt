 
 The agreements look ok.  We discussed earlier the issue of whether or not the 
 Lakeland agreement needed an out for filing with the Florida Public Service 
 Commission or whether this filing was already made.  If I remeber correctly, 
 you were going to check on that.  Did you have a chance to find anything out?

 Gerald,
 
 Pls take one last look at these agreements just to make sure they are ready 
 to go. 
 
 Thanks again for all your help.
