 unbalanced our book and driven the schedulers to near insanity. No, just 
 kidding. But I think there should be a sale of 8 MW from Nevada to Mead on 
 hour 2 somewhere in there. I don't know - I'm not the expert, which is why 
 I'm asking you.
 
 Will you please let Lisa Gang or me know how to fix this. I'm more than happy 
 to do it, just wanted to double check with the man who created the mess in 
 the first place. (Kidding again.)
