 Don't even think you're getting out of this with the "for a while" crap.  
 Just for that you can add a star to the place we're going.
 
 
     
 Hum, while it would be very interesting to see how you act on a date I think 
 I'll have to pass.  My time could be spent in better ways (believe it or 
 not!).  The El Orbits did play at Satellite Lounge alot so I'm sure that's 
 where you've heard them or of them. 
 
 Since I wouldn't want to play second fiddle, we'll have to postpone it for a 
 while.  Have a good one, Margaret

 The el orbits, eh? i've heard of them but don't remember who they are.   
 there is a chance i've seen them at satellite i guess.
 
 my, you are nosey.  i have a little date tonight.  wanna come along?
 
 
     
 Hum, as much as I would love to be insulted by you for several hours straight 
 tomorrow night, I have plans...actually, it's an Enron thing. A bunch of 
 people are going to the Continental Club to hear the El Orbits, which happens 
 to be my favorite band.  You should come. 
 
 What are your plans tonight, since I'm being nosey?!  
 
 Trade them up Johnny, Margarita

 Deathly afraid doesn't even come close to describing it.  Busy tonight.  How 
 bout tomorrow?
 
 
     
 Okay, since you are deathly afraid of being nice to me, now about we go to 
 grab a beer or dinner tomorrow night?  Does that work for you?
