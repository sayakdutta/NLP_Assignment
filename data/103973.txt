 
 Is the question for online and offline products (to the extent that we gear 
 up for metals online)?

 Carol,
 
 Tim Reyes of Alcoa would like to make sure that their current master 
 agreement with Enron will encompass trading metal products, specifically, 
 aluminum products on EOL.  I am hoping that you are the correct person to 
 answer his question.
 
 If you require more information Please contact Mr. Reyes at 865-594-4734.
 
 Thank you,
 
 Noel
