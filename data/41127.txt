Since you're in town, I can run the originals down to you (if you'll tell me where you are) so that you can initial and then I can ask Kevin to sign.
 
 Thanks!

 Marie,
 
 Don't be mad.  I have not gotten it signed.  When I was ready to do so, Belden was unreachable.  Then I suddenly forgot prior to rushing down to H-town.  What do you want me to do now?  Get Kevin this week?  or Get Tim on Tues. after Labor Day?  Are you really mad?  I'm sorry.  Please advise on how I can try and do damage control.

 Hi, Tracy!
 
 I have never received the signature pages for the Allegheny ISDA.  Have you sent them?
