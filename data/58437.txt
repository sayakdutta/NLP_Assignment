 RIO DE JANEIRO -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) said Monday it will invest 
 $455 million in its gas distribution business in Brazil from 2001 to 2004. 
 Robert Gross, vice president of Enron's Brazilian unit, also said the company 
 plans to spend $970 million on thermoelectric projects, but he didn't specify 
 any timetables for the projects.

 companies to build and operate a total of 44 new thermoelectric plants.
