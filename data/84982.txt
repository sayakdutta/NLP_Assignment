 
 Thanks for the phone message.  Glad you made it safely.   It was fun while it 
 lasted.   I received your avalanche of Inside Texas reports.  I will spend 
 the afternoon going through those.  Should make for a busy day.
 
 Give me a call when you get settle and let me know how things are going.  
 Have you told your parents you want airlines miles or points for name brand 
 merchandise during your stay at the house?
 
 Talk to you later and take care.
