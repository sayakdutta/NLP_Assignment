 
 Mark:
 
 I am about to finalize comments to the SITA Master ISDA Agreement on behalf 
 of ECTRIC.  I need your able assistance with respect to the following:
 
 (1)  SITA has not passed a board resolution authorizing execution of the 
 Agreement.  Instead, SITA proposes a certificate stating that its President 
 Directeur General or Directeur General have, pursuant to the Articles of 
 Association, full power and authority to execute the Agreement or to grant a 
 power of attorney to do so.
 
 (2)  SITA has requested evidence of EEFT's authority to sign on behalf of 
 ECTRIC.  I have sent a copy of the power of attorney to the lawyer and will 
 ask that she direct any questions to you if I am not reachable.
 
 SITA's attorney is Susan Hopkinson at Lovells in Paris.  Her phone is 33153 

 
 I will be out of the office Dec. 7 & 8.  Stephanie Panus if assisting with 
 the file.
 
 I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards.  Sara
