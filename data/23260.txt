 
 Thank you for letting me know. Jim
 
  
     
 I just spoke to John Sutton, who was calling from his home in Austin.
 
 He asked that I inform you that he regrets that he will be unable to
 attend the Jurisprudence Luncheon.  He was very much looking forward to
 it, and visiting with you.  Unfortunately he just brought his wife home
 from the hospital, where she had been treated for pneumonia, and needs to
 stay with her at the present time.
