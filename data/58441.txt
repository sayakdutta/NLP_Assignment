 our preliminary views on the RTO filings.  Perhaps it's simply that we are 
 not going to be satisfied until FERC forces nondiscriminatory access and we 
 will object to every filing and fight every shortcoming.

 I have now sent out the PJM filing to some of you.  If anyone else wants it, 
 let me know.
 
 SPP is supposed to file tomorrow.  The same law firm is representing them so 
 I should be able to get a copy.  It may also be on their website tomorrow.
