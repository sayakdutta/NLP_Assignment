 Let me know if you have any questions.
 Thanks,

 I'd like to clarify the type of information Real Time needs in order to fulfill positions for the short term desks.

 Please let me know if you have any questions about this, or any suggestions about how to make this work more smoothly.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate
