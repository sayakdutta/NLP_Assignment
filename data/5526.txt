 just to let you know - i got seats on the 40 yd line for the game.  right now it is going to be  me, you, matt lenhart, and my dad.  i will be out of the office next tuesday and wednesday.  so give me call at work before then or you can call me on my cell (713)-628-3104 or at home (713)661-2601.

 just got my ticket to h-town this weekend.  i wouldn't
 miss this shalacking (?) for the world.  i'm already
 ready to drink. 
 
 hope everything goes well for you guys at ene.  while
 i'm happy to have left, it sucks to know that some
 friends might not have a job in a shitty time to not
 have a job.  i heard you gas traders are alright
 though since you're the only ones who made money for
 enron.  i'm referring to my egm and ees peeps.
