 
 I understand that you spoke with Mark Taylor about eliminating references to 
 individuals in confirms.  I need to speak with you about the ISDA, omnibus 
 and industrial master templates under revision and whether the drafted 
 language conforms to your proposal.  In that regard, you may recall that swap 
 templates were given to you several months ago.  The legal group is 
 concluding a massive form review which necessitates confirm changes.  
 Thanks.  Sara
