 
 Rob, we are planning to file the following protest of HQ's behaviour in the 
 NE power markets through their market based rates case with the FERC, do you 
 have any issues with this approach?
 
 Regards
 Delainey

 Dave -- Kevin has asked that we do a full-blown protest of HQ's continuation 
 of market based rates due to market manipulating behavior that Tom May has 
 seen.  Due 11/30.  Let us know if we should not proceed with the OASIS 
 review, etc. and drafting of protest.  Thanks.
