 Thanks.
 
 I talked with Maria re: who signs TPAs for NNG.  TPAs should be signed by an officer of NNG.  We can prepare the document (i.e., fill in the blanks), but not sign.  I'm working out the details of the process and will forward to you, Mary Draemer, Brad, etc.
 
  
     
 The agreements look great.  Thanks for your efforts.
