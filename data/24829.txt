 I started with Enron May 1, 1997. I would like to know all options and restricted stock I have received since then.
 
 Thanx

 The Cash Balance Plan
 
 If you are vested (at least 5 years with the company) you would be eligilbe for a distribution.  If you go to the HR Web page,
 click on Benefits, A New Look For  Benefits, Pension Plan.  Then you will need to type in your ss# and pin  (which is the last four digits of your ss#)  It will lead you to a place where you could see how to calculate this figure.  You can request a distribution by calling x37979  then press Option 2 Cash  Balance Plan.
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
     
 Kim,
 
 Could you please get me a schedule of my oustanding options and restricted stock including grant price and vesting dates.
 
 Thank you,
 
 Chris
