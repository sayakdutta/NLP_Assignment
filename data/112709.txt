 I would recommend that no one pay.  The wire instructions are at the bottom of the earlier e-mail.  The $ are pre-petition. 
 
 Thanks.
 
 
     
 
 What are going to do would be my question.  Can you get their wire instructions just in case.  Also, I assume those are pre-petition amounts.  If so, I would clarify to the group.
