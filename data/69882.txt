 I would add something to the effect that the appointment terminates if Ben 
 leaves the company's employment.
 
 Thanks,

 Kay, I left the ENA draft for your review.  Was it acceptable?  If so, please 
 initial and I'll have circulated for signature and will draft the other 
 consents accordingly.  Thanks, Deb

 Deb,
 
 Let's go ahead with POA's for Ben F. Jacoby for ENA, Tarheel Land 
 Development, Edgecombe Development, and Titan Land Development in accordance 
 with Janet's request and ENA standard practice. Deb, I have the impression 
 that this is something you typically handle, although I'm glad to volunteer 
 Kathleen for the task if that would help.
 
 There will be other companies, but we can add these as we go.  Kathleen, 
 please advise if there are any which you see as most active at this time. For 
 instance, what are the names of the Florida development companies?
 
 Your assistance is greatly appreciated, as Janet is eager to get this done.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay

 Deb,
 
 I'll get you the particulars, but you get the general idea. I'll have to 
 check on the expense account stuff.
 
 Kathleen, you  haven't done any thing with this request yet, have you?  Could 
 you get the  names of the active development companies so that we can address 
 those, as well as ENA?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay

 Kay, as we discussed previously:
 
 Effective immediately, I would like Ben Jacoby to have signature authority 
 for his team's expense reports as well as all documents whose capital 
 commitments are not greater than $250,000. Most documents will be 
 confidentiality agreements, exclusivity agreements, permit applications, and 
 land/equipment option agreements.
 
 Please forward this (if need be) to the appropriate internal individuals who 
 get this set up. Thanks Kay.
