 Cary,
 
 Here is the picture of the house I have in mind.  I was going for a simple
 farmhouse style to  place on 5 acres near Wimberley.
 
 A few points that might not be obvious from the plans are:
 
 There will be a double porch across the back just like the front
 No dormers (Metal roof)
 1/2 bath under stairs
 Overall dimensions are 55 by 40
 
 
 What I am looking for is a little design help in the kitchen.  More
 cabinets, maybe a different shaped island, and a way to enlarge the pantry.
 Reagan
 suggested that I find a way to make the exterior more attractive.  I want
 to keep a simple roof line to avoid leaks, but I was thinking about
 bringing the left
 side forward in the front of the house and place 1 gable in the front.
 That might look good if the exterior was stone and stucco.  Also the front
 porch would
 be smaller.
 
 I have 3 bids from builders all around $325,000.  I am ready to go ahead
 and have the plans done so I can spec out all the finishings and choose a
 builder.
 I just wanted to give you the opportunity to do the work.  As I mentioned
 my alternative is $0.60/ft.  I thought that since I had a such a detailed
 sketch, you might consider the job for less than the $6,000 that Reagan
 allowed.
