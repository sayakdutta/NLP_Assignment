 
 I currently estimate that 11 individuals from Carrin's and my family will attend.  Jim 
 
  
     
 We are calling all table sponsors to see which tables are being used, and
 how many seats are being filled.  This helps us with the meal order, the
 registration and the room set-up.  I would appreciate your response
 (today preferably) as to the number of family members and/or guests you
 would like us to set a table(s) for.  We can handle the specific names
 either tomorrow or Friday.
 
 Thanks.
 
 Jeff
