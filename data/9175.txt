 of attendees at last Thursday's meeting with Tom Gros.  He had asked about 
 someone being included that had been involved with Enron Online, I felt that 
 she might be perfect to be involved in Networks with her exposure to EOL.  I 
 don't know whether or not you realized that she was in the room for that 
 conference call.  What is she going to do for you in gas?  We may be 
 hardpressed to find another strong candidate for the Networks project who has 
 been as involved with EOL.  --Sally

 Brent Price just stole Jennifer Denny - no discussion or anything.  So I 
 obviously will get Scott Mills in return!
