 The Saudi oil minister is now saying that if Iraqi export volumes do not 
 return to normal (as assumed in the recent OPEC production cut), OPEC might 
 actually increase output at the March meeting.    This seems to reflect fresh 
 doubts about Iraq's speedy return to the market.
 
 Despite reports that loadings are resuming at Ceyhan, our sources believe 
 that Iraqi export volumes are likely to remain below normal levels.  These 
 sources assess that Iraq is continuing to insist on the surcharges.  Some 
 companies will steer clear of any Iraqi oil; others will try to find a way to 
 resume exports without being accused of paying a surcharge.  In any case, it 
 will be difficult for Iraq to ramp up to 2 mb/d by Feb 1 as projected by a 
 SOMO official at the OPEC meeting last week.
 
 Bayoil has reportedly signalled that Iraqi exports are likely to resume 
 normal levels by the end of the month.  However, sources advise that Bayoil 
 is considered to be an unconventional player compared to the traditional 
 major lifters of Iraqi crude, and it is an especially aggressive buyer of 
 Iraqi oil.  It may be willing to do business with Iraq sooner than the more 
 established players.  Therefore, it might be incorrect to assume that firms 
 are ramping up Iraqi liftings across the board based solely on indications 
 from Bayoil.
 
 Iraq averaged around 600,000 b/d in December.  According to news reports, 13 
 mb of Basra Light and 4 mb of Kirkuk have been exported so far in January.
