 Sara-thank you for looking into this issue for us.  Here is a brief
 summary of what occured.
 
 
 UBS and Enron entered into a Sterling-UBS spot transaction on 11-19-01,
 which both parties confirmed and settled on 11-21. (UBS pays USD
 7,083,500 and receives 5 mio sterling).
 
 On 11-21 UBS and Enron erroneously confirmed the same trade again for
 settlement on 11-21. UBS made a second USD 7,083,500 payment to Enron's
 account at BA-Dallas on 11-21 (payment reference: FED IMA
 1121B1Q8052C001081).
 
 UBS did not receive the Sterling it was expecting and for the next few
 days Enron and UBS tried to resolve the non-payment based on a mistaken
 assumption that Enron owed 5 mio Sterling to UBS.
 
 On 11-28, UBS realized that the trade was duped and on 11-29 informed
 Enron of the nature of the error and requested that the USD payment be
 returned. Enron agreed to return the USD payment on 11-29. The returned
 payment was never received.
