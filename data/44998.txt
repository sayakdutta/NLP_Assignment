 trade.

 Tana,
 I'm with Risk Assessment and Control and I'm currently not trading in the 
 account.  (It is an old account that was opened before I started at Enron.  I 
 haven't traded in it because Enron appears to trade in everything! )  
 However, since I have you,  I am currently considering buying some options in 
 soybeans. Would this be against Enron policy?  
 Thanks,
 Frank
 
 
 
 
    
  
 Thanks for your response.  Yes, I I do need to know two things.  First, the 
 group you are in, and then second, what products you are trading out of the 
 account.  The Enron Trading Policy prohibits employees from trading in any of 
 the products the company trades in.
 
 Thanks!
