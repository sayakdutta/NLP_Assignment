 
 If I can't swing Friday, how about planning on being there at 9:00am?
 
 
     
 
 From www.cfainc.org:
 
 CFA International Cat Show. George R. Brown Convention Center, 1001 Avenue
 of the Americas. Adults: $7.00; Seniors & Children 6-12: $5.00; Children
 under 6: Free. Show Hours: Fri., Sat. & Sun. 9 a.m. - 5 p.m.
 
 
     
 
 I'm trying to take next week off.  Not sure I can swing Friday yet.  I
 might be able to leave early.  I am definitely game for attending.  Does
 it start on Friday and go through Sunday?  ILY, K.
 
 
     
 
 ...in fact, would you consider taking this Friday off from work?  I just
 talked to Bob Corrigan and scheduled to meet him for lunch and we could
 both
 see him......and we could catch the CFA show, too...
