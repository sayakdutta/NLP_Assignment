 EnronCredit.com Ltd. was going to work since Dennis O'Connell (London lawyer) 
 is responsible for that group.  Maybe you will be able to clarify which of 
 Jeff's "positions" will be hedges and which will be backed to EnronCredit.  
 Maybe Rod will be handling most of Jeff's credit.  I'd appreciate an update.

 Sara,
 
 Please contact either Paul Radous or me on credit derivatives in the U.S.  
 Rod Nelson is the lead credit support for EnronCredit.com and should also be 
 available in London, if necessary.  I am not aware of these recent trades but 
 I am having lunch with Jeff Kinneman on Thursday to discuss among other 
 things Credit support for his business.  
 
 It does concern me that we would offer to provide collateral DLJ without 
 Treasury's approval.

 I am seeing more and more credit derivatives.  The trades originating in 
 Houston are coming from Jeff Kinneman's bond/debt traders but are booked in 
 the name of ECT Investments, Inc. or ENA.  I can't be certain if these are 
 backed to EnronCredit.com Limited.  
 
 In particular, there is a proposed total return bond trade with DLJ 
 International Capital requiring ECT Investments to post collateral.  We have 
 no master with this party.  Who in Houston credit  is looking at credit 
 derivatives?
 
 FYI, other credit deals seem to be transacted wtih Deutsche Bank and UBS AG.
