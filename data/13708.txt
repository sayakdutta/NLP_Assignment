 Michelle,
 
 Please draft a separation agreement for Andrea Hauser.  Nowlan/Shankman have agreed to compensate Andrea for the 6 month non-compete period.
 
 Andrea will be in the office on Monday to sign the agreement and is leaving the country on Tuesday.  Will it be a problem to have the agreement by 10:30 on Monday?
 
 Thanks,
 Shanna
