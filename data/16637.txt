 Could you please see that Sandi gets this?  Thanks.  If folks would like to 
 get Sandi information (e.g., the load curtailment proposal discussed by Gary 
 yesterday), please send to Scott, who's with our lobbying firm in 
 Sacramento.  Sandi, Scott (Stoness) would like to discuss this proposal on 
 tomorrow's (Friday's) 8:00 AM conference call.  Thank you.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
