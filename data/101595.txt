 no offense taken and i'm agreed on the camaraderie aspect...just don't think excessive drinking is an appropriate response.
 
 and, though i don't think you intended to, please don't EVER imply that i would crawl in a corner and be afraid...not in my nature

 you're right, the events of this past week were tough, but on reflection these events have not made me want to crawl in a corner and be afraid- just the opposite - they made me realize that life is fragile and short.  so why not enjoy it in the company of some good friends?
 
 No offense :-)
 
  
     
 Hate to be the party pooper but, based on the events today and this entire week, a shot contest is the last thing on my mind.
 
  
     
 
 
 My money is on Bass to beat Susan in the shot contest.

 sounds like little woodrow's is the choice.
 
 hull and i will be there at 3 so just come up whenever- just look for the two passed-out drunks at the bar
 
  
     
 Little Woodrow's downtown sounds good.  Any objections or other suggestions?
 
  
     
 I am and I hear that little woodrow's is having some kind of a party.
