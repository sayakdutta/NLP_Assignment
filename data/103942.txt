 Sara-
 
 Here is a term sheet from another potential counterparty.  DB is treating any 
 ISDAs with Banker Trust Co as a temporary thing and would like to have new 
 ISDAs negotiated in DBs name.

 Jeff - per our conversation today, I have attached a basic equity forward
 confirm (note that this is our generic form and will be modified to suit
 the contract that we enter into) .  I have also attached a document
 discussing a proprietary way that we have developed to enter into tax
 deductible forwards.  I look forward to working with you further with
 regard to this transaction
 
 
 Best regards,
