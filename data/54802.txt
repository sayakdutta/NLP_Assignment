 
 Ehud,
 
 I am flying back in the evening and dinner would be difficult.
 I shall be glad to join you for lunch,
 
 Shirley, as I understand gave you my requirements for the AV.
 
 My flight arrives at 8:30 a.m. I can meet you at your office in the morning 
 and 
 we can talk about the conference and other issues.

 Vince,
 
 Good morning.
 
 Further to your forthcoming visit this Wed., I write to clarify last-minute
 details:
 
 1.  Your ETA/ETD.  Will you be available to join us for lunch and/or dinner?
 
 2.  Your AV requirements, if any.  Should you need either, we have an
 overhead projector as well as laptop capability (either YOUR laptop, or we
 can with advance notice reserve a laptop if you bring floppies).
 
 BTW, any developments re Jeff Skilling's 2/22 conference keynote?
 
 Best,
 Ehud
