 
 Becky at APS turned down a tag for me last night for HE 4MST that we have 
 been using for several weeks without a problem.  The tag number is 18594.  
 Tis was a sale from EPE to PNM at 4C.  She turned it down saying that EPE is 
 not a control area at 4C and that PNM should be in the CA for the first 
 line.  I argued with her about it for quite a while but she insisted that it 
 was wrong.  Could you please take a look at this and tell me if she is wrong. 
 Thank you.
