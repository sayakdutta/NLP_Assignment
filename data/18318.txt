 on the "investigation" discussions with the Republicans in today's meeting 
 with Lay.  You still around?

 Looks good.  I wouldn't stress the MOU, but would rather focus on the 
 "melding" of alot of good ideas.  The Investigation concession comes from 
 whom?

 Friday.

 Basics of Proposal
 Something akin to the MOU (that adequately addresses the solvency issue, for 
 the IOUs, the State and QFs), but WITHOUT the transmission component
 Direct Access for ALL customers, transitioning to a core/noncore market 
 structure in 18-24 months (this can be accomplished without stranding CDWR's 
 contracts)
 Concessions
  -IOUs (MOU modifications)
  -Generators (past due amounts)
  -investigations
 Package to finance the deal (bond issuance backed by rate increases to permit 
 securitization)
 
 Message
 This is the last best chance to achieve a comprehensive settlement
 We have developed a comprehensive solution and are meeting with everyone that 
 will see us.
 We have thus far received positive feedback on and a willingness to work with 
 our proposal
 We intend to work tirelelessly to gain support for a total solution---it's 
 vital, and time's running out
