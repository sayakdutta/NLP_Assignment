 TRANSWESTERN PIPELINE CONTRACT APPROVAL REQUEST
 
 Phillips Petroleum Company's discount letter was recently approved by 
 Transwestern's Officer group.   However, Phillips has now requested that 
 Transwestern include language in the discount letter which guarantees the 
 applicable discount rate in the event that Transwestern's minimum Tariff rate 
 were to be higher than the discount rate.  I have underlined the additional 
 language  in the attached revised discount letter (language will not be 
 underlined when provided to Phillips).  The inclusion of this language would 
 require Transwestern to file the discount as a negotiated rate prior to gas 
 flow under the term of the amendment.  Transwestern would file this discount 
 on January 31, 2001.
 
 Please review the attached document and indicate approval via REPLY WITH 
 HISTORY.
 All Officer approvals will be sent to Bill Cordes for final President Level 
 approval.
