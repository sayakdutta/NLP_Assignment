 What I was told by your secretary and Marty was that ENA was keeping one of 
 the signed originals, and I picked up the other to give to Schroeder.  I do 
 not exactly know where ENA's original went.  Lets ask Marty.
 
 
   
  
 I thought that someone retrieved the originals (which has been signed by GE 
 but not Enron) while I was in Ft. Worth for my dad's surgery. Marty mentioned 
 that you were looking for them, so I thought  he had given them to you (he's 
 out this week).  I have not seen the termination agreement since I returned. 
 Did you and John leave fully executed termination agreements in my office?  
 Maybe someone else picked them up.  
 
 I can't tell you what's going on with the assignment.  Perhaps Peggy Banczak 
 can help out with that.

 Schroeder and I left two signed originals with you, so what does "processed" 
 mean.  Yes, thankyou for asking, GE has received their fully executed 
 original, and therefore should be prepared to issue the invoice to 
 Purchaser.  But I have not seen the invoice yet.
 
 What is the status of the assignment of the GE contract to Mitsui?  Did the 
 invoice go to them?
 
 

  
  
 I haven't seen a signed copy of the termination agreement cross my desk.  I 
 just want to make sure that the fully executed document has been processed.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
