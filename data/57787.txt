 I just heard about this bill by La Seur
 
 ABX1 70 attempts to criminalize acts of unregulated generators if they 
 perform maintenance at times other than the California Public Utilities 
 Commission requires. Further, the commission is required to allow scheduled 
 maintenance of only one generator at a time. 
 So, with 500 generators in the state, just how  many years would it take to 
 complete one round of maintenance?  Also, please note it does not apply to 
 munis.
