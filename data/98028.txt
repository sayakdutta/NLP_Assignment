 As we have discussed, for the personal jurisdiction and other Rule 12
 motions, we would like to prove a negative and show that none of the Enron
 companies has had any contacts or relationships with any of the named
 plaintiffs.
 
 There is now posted on the Kansas extranet a Dwight's printout showing the
 wells / leases in Kansas for which Quinque Operating Company is the
 operator.  You might have someone at Northern examine this list and see if
 the well, lease, field, and reservoir names trigger any thoughts about
 whether Northern has any connection or relationship with Quinque.  Thanks.
 
 If you have any trouble getting it downloaded from the extranet, I can fax
 the list to you.
