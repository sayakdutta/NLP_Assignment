 
 Did I respond?  (Life is nuts; I'm losing it.)  Anyway, Peter de Vroede 
 signed my up with him last week (so I'm not sure why I'm still on the list).  
 Anywho, would have been fun.  Sorry I'm already booked.  Had the midterm last 
 nite--wasn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be, though I'm sure I made 
 about a thousand dumb little mistakes.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Hey Jeff,
 
 Hope all went well for you on the mid-term.  Do you have a room-mate for the 
 mid-term retreat?  Your name was on a list.  Let me know if you need one.  I 
 have been a little lax with my responses and did not get back to Diane.
