 
 I just spoke with CES.  CES will keep the National Fuel for the month of June 
 since June is the last month.   Please call me when you get a chance to 
 discuss everything.
 
 I did not discuss the Equitrans gas with CES.  I want to talk to Scott about 
 that tomorrow.
 
 
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
    
 No home yet. May have to take to Penn Fuel.  I left a message with Equitable 
 to see if they are interested in Peoples, EOG, Equitrans and Penn Fuel.
 What are you going to do with the CPA.  Bary Vanderhorst w/EES might be 
 interested.  If not I wll contact Equitable.
 
 I will contact Dominion to see if they are interested in any of this gas.

 Do you have a home for the T&F Explor behind Penn Fuel for June?  
 
 I left a message for Charlie at CES this morning about all the other citygate 
 production.  I'm also trying to get a bid from CNG for the month of June on 
 the EOG and 
 Peoples gas.  I'll keep you posted.
