 
 I had a good interview with Andy Maus yesterday.  He is a strong candidate 
 and I wanted to make you aware of his background.  His resume is attached 
 below.  Please contact Andy if you are interested in talking with him.
 
 Thanks.
 Mike

 Mike,
 
 Thanks again for meeting with me today.  It was a pleasure to finally meet 
 you, I appreciate your help in my redeployment process.  Attached is my 
 resume that should provide a snapshot of my background and skills for those 
 you have in mind.
 
 I will be in Houston meeting and interviewing until next Wednesday, April 
 12th. Hopefully there will be the opportunity to meet with some your team 
 before I return to London.  My contact phone is listed below, and I am 
 sitting on 45 this week.  I'll update you with my progress before I leave 
 next week.
 
 Talk with you soon.
 
  Andy
