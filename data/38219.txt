 
 My physical hedge strips are not matching sitara for San Juan and Permian.  Please check the positions for DEC and take a look at how all of the transport is booked.
 
 Thanks,

 I have stranded all the transport to the border out of Keystone for the month of December.
 
 The transport volumes that have been taken out are as follows:
 
 	22,836 - Keystone  -->  Socal Ehrenburg
 
 	11,418 - Keystone  -->  Socal Ehrenburg (this is the mexican de cobra deal).  Previously Mexican de Cobra was buying the gas from Texaco.  Starting in 					December, Mexican will have to find another supply for this gas.  They will no longer buy from Texaco.  Phil Polsky is talking with 					Mexican, and a deal will be entered into Sitara, once Mexican has found a supply.  So as of now, the 11,828 supply coming into Keystone 				for this deal is not in the system.
 
 	3975 - Keystone  -->  Socal Topock
