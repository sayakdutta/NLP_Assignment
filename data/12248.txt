 
 Rich, thanx for the sampling update.  Ill pass it along to the apropriate 
 parties.  A cursory look at the data shows it to be inconsistently up and 
 down, as expected, with no glaring increases.  Anything urgent we need to 
 discuss?

 Hi Larry,
 
 Here is an updated pipeline liquid testing summary (as of late January -
 early February) for the Hinkley and Kettleman areas, including the Filter
 separator units at Mohave.
 
 Hope things are going well!
