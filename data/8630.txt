Did you know that this had grown so large?  James says that this sits in Shelly Stubbs' lap to solve and that he has offered up resources to help. Sounds as if the offer has not been taken by Shelly.  
 
 Bill is obviously out of his crisis mode on counterparty credit issues and has lifted his head to look at other things.  I hate getting these e-mails from him --he always has more info than I do on issues and for some reason his confidence level in operations is not incredibly strong because he always contacts me!  I would love for someone else on the operations team to gain his confidence and I am sure that you would like for him to come to you with issues instead of always contacting me first.  (Don't worry - you are not alone in this -- applies to EA, EGM and EIM as well).  Let's talk about how we can manage this better.

 This problem is a result of the lack an automated interface between GCP and RPS and RGS.  My understanding is that Todd Taylor on your team is working on this interface.  What is the expected completion of this interface, and if is later than today, what can be done to deliver this ASAP.  With the large number of Mass Market deals being done, it is imperative to have an automated solution to this problem.  Can you call me today with an update?  Thanks. -Sally

 This is totally unacceptable.  Is there any focus on cleaning this up?
