 Jeff,
  This weekend while I was at Penn I spent some time with Gary (he interned 
 with us last summer) and found out that he has received an offer from JP 
 Morgan for Trading.  It is a pretty good offer overall but I still think that 
 Enron is a better opportunity and we just need to convince him of that.  I 
 was hoping you could take a few minutes out to call him and talk to him about 
 it.  I really thought we would be able to have him sign full-time but now 
 this throws a little curveball into things.  His home number is 215-386-4251 
 and his cell phone number is 215-432-5635.  This is a really bright, great 
 guy that I think would end up becoming a major asset to Enron.  If there is 
 anything I can do please let me know, but I'm sure hearing from you will make 
 a difference.
 
 Sarah
