 Attached is an invitation to the Summer Picnic this Saturday, June 23 from =
 4:00-9:00 pm at the Regal Ranch.  Many of you may have already received thi=
 s, but I wanted to extend my personal invitation to you.  This is a really =
 fun activity, and has traditionally been one of the best opportunities to v=
 isit with our Program participants on an informal basis.  This is a family =
 outing with lots of activities for the kids, and you can come and go as you=
  please.
 
 Please make an effort to attend on Saturday, even if you can only join us f=
 or a little while.  Feel free to pass this invitation on to other executive=
 s in your business unit.  The Analysts and Associates tell us that this typ=
 e of exposure to our business leaders helps drive excitement and enthusiasm=
  within the Program.  Your support of events like this is incredibly valuab=
 le, and appreciated.
 
 If you can join us, please rsvp to Jackie Coleman by email, or at extension=
  x54070.
 
 Thank you,
 Billy
