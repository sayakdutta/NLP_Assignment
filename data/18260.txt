 I'm am officially responsible for the case and of course appreciate all 
 Dylan's (and everyone else's) efforts.  Here's my game plan.  I'm going to 
 spend the day working on it---adding to what's already been passed around.  
 Dylan, I'll look at the numbers and perhaps send you (and others) thoughts 
 regarding the crunching, since you've already starting crunching.  I'll try 
 to do as much of the write-up (building on what others have done) and send 
 around by COB today.  Once everyone's had a chance to comment, etc. I'll 
 finalize tomorrow night.  I have to fly to Houston at the crack of dawn on 
 Monday and therefore can't go to class, so I'm hoping that someone else can 
 turn it in.  Let me know if this works for folks.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 I am sorry guys.  I have been working on the pro forma P&L numbers for the 
 mergers and have not finished them.  I have a Saturday class tomorrow, and 
 I will try to send it to you as soon as I can.
 
 Dylan
