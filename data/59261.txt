 I got the email.  We didn't have any flight  plans made yet anyway.  The bachelor party sounds like it will be fun as long as us married guys can get away. I haven't been to Vegas ever so that would be fun for me.  We should stay at the Belagio if it is available for a decent price.  August is offseason in Vegas right??   Those party  days are too far behind me to remember right now.  I need a weekend away so I can get some  sleep.  If you want to feel your age just get a few kids and get no sleep for a few months.  You have the right address for me but it isn't in an Italian neighborhood we don't allow any down here.  
 
 Remember that the Baptism for Caroline  is Saturday August 4th  in NJ. We are having a dinner after at a place nearby the church I hope you both can make it.  It should be at 2 or 3 in the afternoon.   
 
 Talk to you soon 
 
 Pete
