 
 Amy Kim is still an open question.
 I think it's fine to put all charitable contribuitions in one place.  Are they transferring $ or just responsibilitiy?
 I want to show Jeff the year-to-year differences 200-2001-2002 and show transfers into the organization (eg from EBS), transfers out of the organization and other reductions in headcount.
 I'm not sure that we need to include alot of other metrics (they haven't worked in the past).
 
  
     
 Steve - I hope your vacation was terrific!
 
 Now that you're back, I'll start bombarding you with budget questions:
 
 - Rick mentioned on Friday that Amy Kim was moving into your budget.  When does that start, and should I include her for next year?  Aside from budget issues - what will be her function or group?
 
 - Rick has asked that all charitable contributions budgeted in his group be run through Community Relations.  I'll forward the numbers to Elyse and Misha.  Are there any other groups within Public Affairs that you want to do this as well?  For example, Palmer has made some this year, as have you.  
 
 I'm guessing the Terraso and Kimberly should continue to budget this in their cost centers.
 
 - What sorts of metrics do you want to show in our Skilling meeting?  (I'm assuming for Public Affairs.)
 	- Do you want to illustrate value added (origination/risk mitigation/market opening/earned media)?
 	- I'll do a chart showing difference year to year, and the composition of such difference.  Do you want to break this down 	by group?  Do you also want to illustrate headcount differences?
 	- In the past we've illustrated fixed (empl and empl expenses) vs. variable (everything else) costs.  Do you want a chart to 	illustrate this?
 	- What else would you like to show for PA?
 
 - What sorts of metrics do you want to show for your other groups?
 	- EPSC and Aviation
 	- HR/Benefits and Exec Compensation
