 
 Becky,
 
 I am sending you two spreadsheets. Headcount gives  the allocations by major
 business units. Please, see the sheet Allocations. Line 83 gives you the 
 percentages
 you can use.
 
 Budget  spreadsheet gives the budget projections. The sheet Allocations has 
 been modified to 
 include charges to RAC and GRM. I had to modify extensively  the sheet Detail
 to account for the size of the group (as compared with 25 rows available to 
 list the
 employees in the original spreadsheet). Please, check the logic of my 
 modifications
 (I hope I copied all the formulas correctly). I had to assume a bonus number.
 
 
 I shall work on allocations by different business units within ENA
 and GRM  but it's chasing a moving target. It changes from month to month. 
 
 I shall be gone for the next 4 business days. Please, call me and leave a 
 message
 on my voice mail if there is any question. I shall be listening to my voice 
 messages.
 
 Sorry if there are any problems. I have to rush to catch my plane.
 
 
 Vince
 
 P.S. Thanks for all the help. I owe you lunch.
