 too many for you to receive I don't mind faxing it.  You can always call me 
 from the office with the fax number when you're ready - I can even leave it 
 with my assistant when I'm away from my desk in case you get her instead of 
 me.
 
 It's finally winter here, too.  Of course that's nothing compared to you guys 
 - it might get down into the 30's at night and 40's in the daytime.  It's 
 only really bad when it's that cold and it rains.  Brrrr.  It was probably 
 pretty smart of Delta to send those planes to Cincinnati since as a hub they 
 could probably get them on connecting flights to wherever they were 
 originally headed more easily from there than anywhere else (of course a lot 
 were probably headed to NYC and the flights there the next day must have been 
 packed!).
 
 Aside from a quick one-day trip to New York I haven't had to do any traveling 
 lately - I'll probably be going to Portland in early March and Amsterdam 
 mid-March.  I may try and get to South America sometime in February but 
 nothing is scheduled yet.
 
 Love, Mark
