 
 Thanks, Sarah.  Question:  Could we, and should we, attempt to pre-empt the 
 FERC report and try to get press coverage of the BP paper before FERC 
 releases the results of its investigation?

 This is just a rumor, but we heard on the EPSA call today that Scott Miller 
 is trying to get his report on the California part of his investigation to 
 the Commissioners by Friday of this week.  
 
 Also, the EPSA/Boston Pacific paper continues to be revised, but EPSA wants 
 to get it to FERC as soon as possible (but if Scott completes his report by 
 Friday it may not be in time for Scott's report), so they have asked us to 
 review the report and Executive Summary and get comments back to them for a 
 conference call on Friday.  Since we will be at FERC during the EPSA call, we 
 will need to get any comments we may have to Julie by Thursday evening or 
 Friday morning.
 
 Thanks everyone.
 
 Sarah

 RE: Boston Pacific Statistical Research Project
 
 Attached is the latest draft of the full Boston Pacific statistical research

 cost estimates for new peakers have been removed.
 
 Please review the documents so we can discuss them on a conference call on 
 Friday, October 6th at 11:00 a.m. EST and then release it to Scott Miller for
