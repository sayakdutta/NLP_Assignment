 
 Hi there,
 
 In resolving some issues with Westinghouse there was an agreement reached 
 concerning the disposition of the Blue Girl turbines, as well as certain 
 issues relating to the Gleason and Wheatland facilities.  In connection with 
 this agreement I am forwarding to you a draft letter agreement concerning 
 resolution of these matters.  As you can see, Westinghouse has requested that 
 NEPCO, EEPC and LJM2-Turbine, LLC sign the agreement.
 
 Your comments would be appreciated.

 Attached are SWPC revisions to your proposed letter. Our contracts group
 advised to add signatures for all affected parties to the agreement, in
 addition to know parties for contracts on Gleason and Wheatland sites, we
 have added parties identified in draft Blue Girl contract, Enron input as to
 appropriate Enron signatures for the Blue Girl would be appreciated.  Please
 call with any concerns.
