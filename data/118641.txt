 dates we discussed for early/mid March.

 I am not sure if Christian got back with you on the possible timing for our 
 legal seminar in Portland but Tim Belden is out until Friday and Christian is 
 out until Monday.  Christian indicated to me that he was going to call you on 
 Monday with a definitive date.
