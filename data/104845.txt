 I am told by Theresa Brogan that Enron Networks requires an account with one 
 of the prime brokers frequently used by ENA and other Enron Corp. 
 subsidiaries and that you are handling this particular agreement.  ENA has 
 negotiated multiple accounts with Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc. and Morgan 
 Stanley & Co. International Limited (collectively, "Morgan").  We have an 
 agreed form of Customer Agreement with Morgan which has been easy to 
 duplicate for additional affiliates of ENA.  Also, we screen all agreements 
 through credit and risk control (since our resolutions for opening brokerage 
 accounts require dual signatures from both the Enron affiliate and risk 
 control).
 
 I don't know what your procedure is in London but let me know if we can be of 
 any assistance.  Theresa is holding the docs until I hear back from you.
 
 Thanks.  Sara
