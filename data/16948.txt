 From our contact with the Governor's office, seems that Kari Dohn, formerly 
 in the Governor's office, and recently appointed Chair of the Electricity 
 Oversight Board, would be the hands-down best candidate.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 If any of you have ideas on this, please respond ASAP.  As you may know, I 
 sit on the CSU Foundation Board of Governors, accountable to Chancellor 
 Reed.  Anything we can do to support the upcoming meeting will go a long way.
 
 Regards, Tom

 Greetings Tom, in preparation for our upcoming Board of Governors' meeting,
 I would like to ask you for your help in getting a speaker for the evening.
 The March 11 (Sunday) Board meeting in Sacramento is focused around CSU
 Legislative Day scheduled for Monday, March 12.  The Board meeting is
 scheduled to begin at 4:00 pm followed by a dinner.  We will invite the CSU
 Trustees to attend the dinner along with other key CSU leaders; we normally
 have about 30-40 individuals attend the dinner.
 
 This year, we would like to invite someone from the Governor's office to
 come and talk a little about the energy crises in California.  Can you help
 us identify someone in Davis' administration that may be interested in
 speaking to this distinguished group of individuals?
 
 Again, briefly,
 Meeting date/time:  Sunday, March 11, 2001 at 4:00 pm; dinner is scheduled
 for 6:45pm; in Sacramento.
 
 I look forward to hearing from you soon.
