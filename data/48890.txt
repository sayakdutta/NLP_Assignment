 
 Dave,
 
 I am sending you my accomplishments for the last year.
 I am including also one document (just browse through it quickly)
 to give you a flavor of some projects I have been working on.
 
 I shall send you shortly an additional document I would like you to browse 
 through
 (the list of projects my group works on in a typical week) to give you more 
 information
 about the scope and depth of what we do. It's an internal document and I want 
 to clean 
 it up
 
 Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year to  you and  your family.
 
 
 Vince
