 
 Guys,
 
 Attached below is a presentation that I put together for M Frevert for the 
 latest analyst presentation.  We kept it to only a few businesses -  they 
 didn't end up using any of it.  I do however want to have an EGM presentation 
 that everyone can use.  Please prepare a section on each of your businesses 
 and return via email or hard copy.  Don't worry about power point, simply the 
 dot points that you want on the page.
 
 Thanks,
 mike
