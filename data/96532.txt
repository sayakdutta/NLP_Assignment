 To all the patient participants:
 
     Attached is a copy of the finalized and approved ERCOT Wholesale
 Enabling Agreement.  The copyright application is pending but I know of
 no reason not to use it before the approximate 6 months it will take to
 obtain the copyright.  In any case, as you all know, this agreement was
 created by a committee of ERCOT members and their attorneys.  It is a
 voluntary instrument and may be used by anyone choosing to do so (even
 non ERCOT members).  It is not required to be used by any ERCOT member
 or anyone choosing to do business within ERCOT.  It may be modified by
 attaching an Exhibit "E."  ERCOT disclaims any liability through use of
 the agreement and as reflected in the disclaimer on page one of the
 Agreement.
 
     Please call me with any questions.  Good luck to you all. I enjoyed
 working with you on this project.
