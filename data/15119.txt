 Ray,
 
 I would like the bring up the attached fact sheet and the market notice below (already brought to your attention by Dave Perrino) with Scott Miller and Bob Pease, as appropriate.

 Normally I'd say this is unbelievable...but considering who sent it, I can't say I'm surprised...
 
 Ray,
 
 Should we take this up with Bob Pease, or since it was inadequate to begin with, just forget it?
 
 Dave
