 Did you include Gene Diers and Mark holdsworth
 
 



  
  
 Attached is what I hope is a pretty complete list of the EnronOnline 
 contracts I have been made aware of.  There are a few I have open questions 
 about  or am waiting to receive copies of the contract.  Can each of you 
 please take a look and think about whether there are any others we may be 
 missing.  Again, my time frame is short here, so if I can get your response 
 promptly I would be most appreciative.
