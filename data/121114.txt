 
 They are forwarding the name and number of a financial/credit guy from Noresco as soon as they can.  They asked for a ball park and I could not help them.  Would it make a difference if we did 20 year index (for baseload) with gs daily for the swing?  Due to credit requirements from others we are competeing with on this, they are considering an index with the supplier with Noresco doing an internal financial swap with a sister company, perhaps Equitable.  
 what do you think?  I will keep you posted on discussions.
 
 Thanks!
