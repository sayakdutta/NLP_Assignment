 Have you seen this?  Any view on whether there's a group of economists who 
 think otherwise and might be willing to express their views in a response to 
 this letter?
 
 P.S. Talked to Tyson re: trying to get economists back in the middle of this, 
 but I wasn't altogether successful.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
