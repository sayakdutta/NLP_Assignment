 do with him?

 fyi - it doesn't sound like the weather piece of the Oslo long-term deals is 
 going to have much value.  We are still trying to get that value from Oslo 
 and ensure that the weather risk is captured appropriately in EGM risk 
 books.  I will keep you updated.

 This deal was done as a Power game and when we split it, the main value will 
 be on the power book, so don't calc on anything substantial on this

 Thor - We are going to meet with Jeff Shankman on Thursday to discuss 3rd 
 Quarter earnings.  If we can get an idea by then of the value associated with 
 the weather piece of the Kotka deal it would be helpful.  Call me if you have 
 any concerns regarding this request.  Thanks for your help.

 We haven't finalised the strip out of the remaining weather risk from the 
 power book, but we will surely send that over as soon as we have done it

 Bjarne and Thor,
 
 Thanks for the confirmation and other information that you provided on this 
 deal.  I still need the associated P&L and Weather Risk transferred from the 
 Nordic Power books to the Weather book.
 
 It is imperative that this be done immediately from a Risk controls 
 standpoint not to mention the fact that Quarter-end is fast approaching.  
 Please call or e-mail so as to update me of your progress.
 
 
 Thanks,
 Todd
