 
 Thank you for your earlier response.  Enron's offices will be closed on 
 Monday, September 6 and I understand that your office will be closed on 
 Tuesday, September 7.  Will you be available for a conference call on 
 Wednesday, September 8?  I would like to discuss generally the financial 
 trading issues which I will need to address.  I look forward to hearing from 
 you.  Regards.  Sara
