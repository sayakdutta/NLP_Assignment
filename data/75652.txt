 
 Plse  have fax delivered home.
 
 Today is the day.  I have been a mom for 21 years.  Can't be true.
 
 Still on conference call.  Ben has been very nice. 
 
 
    
  
 Is today Paige's birthday or tomorrow.  Of course if it was great news, then 
 it could be a celebratory drink.  I told Ric I may come by for a drink, but I 
 didn't know yet.  I think I'll call and get exact directions.
 
 Do you need this fax I got from King and Spalding with comments on Midway?

 No news today.  I don't want to know today, as I'm drinking champagne and 
 ignoring the issue,
