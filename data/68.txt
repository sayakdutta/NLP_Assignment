 I am sending off a follow-up to a bid I submitted to Clark County PUD.  They 
 have requested term pricing for Stanfield on a volume of 17,000.  Could you 
 give me a basis for the period :
 
 Sept -00 - May 31, 2006
 Sept-00 - May 31, 2008
 
 Since I assume you do not keep a Stanfield basis, but rather a basis off 
 Malin or Rockies, it would probably make sense to show the basis as an 
 adjustment to one of these point.  Also, what should the Mid - Offer Spread 
 be on these terms.
 
 Thanks, Mike
