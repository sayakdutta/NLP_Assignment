 Cindy,
 
 Please find attached the Argentine peso and CPI forecast.
 
 It should be noted that a vote is pending in the Argentine Congress (had be=
 en expected today) to adjust the convertibility law in Argentina to allow a=
  basket of euros and U.S. dollars in equal weights (once parity is reached =
 for euro-dollar) that would replace the existing one-for-one peso to US dol=
 lar currency board.  The economy ministry took a first step toward this new=
  basket regime by introducing this week a dual-exchange rate system for the=
  traded sector that allows Argentine exporters to benefit from the weaker e=
 uro by receiving export earnings in line with a mixed basket of 50% euros a=
 nd 50% US dollars.  At today's spot rates, this implies an 8% depreciation =
 of the peso vis-a-vis the basket.  An 8% devaluation at this juncture does =
 not gain the kind of competitiveness needed by Argentine exporters to help =
 boost economy when a major trading partner, Brazil, has depreciated 21% vis=
 -a-vis the USD since the beginning of this year.  Initial reports indicate =
 that consumer and corporate borrowers, however, would still pay debt servic=
 e at the dollar peg exchange rate (one-for-one). =20
 
 With such a change in currency regime as being contemplated in the Argentin=
 e Congress, investor confidence could wane if the plan is approved and as t=
 he implications of the new plan are interpreted by the market and as the su=
 stainability of the existing currency board arrangement outside the export =
 sector is analyzed.  A loss of investor confidence will put additional pres=
 sure on the peso, pressure which has not existed previous to this new annou=
 ncement by economy chief Cavallo, especially now that the government's debt=
  swap (exchanging short-term goverment paper for longer-term bonds) has bee=
 n successfully executed.  As a consequence, although our forecast attached =
 below assumes a one-for-one peso peg to the US dollar at this point to allo=
 w the quarterly revaluations to be completed in a timely fashion, this curv=
 e is subject to change upon knowledge of the Congressional vote and an anal=
 ysis of the details announced with the vote as to the mechanics of this new=
  basket regime for exporters and for the economy as a whole.
