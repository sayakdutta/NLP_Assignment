 Mary,
 
 Thanks.  Can you give me some contact names at PGE.  I know Peggy Fowler but 
 who does FERC and RTO stuff?

 Alan Comnes, Christi Nicolay 
 
  
 In response to PGE's request that we coordinate more on various regulatory 
 and legislative proceedings and our conversation today, we have agreed as 
 follows:
 
 Due to code of conduct concerns and tight deadlines for regulatory filings, 
 it is typically difficult to coordinate in advance.  However, provided there 
 are no code of conduct concerns, we will attempt to provide to PGE finalized 
 drafts in advance of filing.
 RTO negotiations are one area we can clearly coordinate because they do not 
 involve code of conduct issues but instead involve broad policy issues.
 On litigation matters, if ENA legal and PGE want to coordinate, Richard 
 Sanders should be responsible for the coordination.
