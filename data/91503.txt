 hmm, synapses not jumping - i know the feeling,  i think i have three neurons firing in my brain this morning... 
 
 i know what you mean about getting soft - when i went home to virginia for christmas, my mom was like "it's cold out, shouldn't you put a jacket on?" and having been toughened by the brutal calgary winters (in addition to being the super tough guy that i am) i did go out --- naked almost every day.  
 
 let me know when you'er heading over to bass brothers and i'll meet up with you - i have a few things to do but drinks after work should fit in.    
 
 i ran into eze (aka emily) at banana republic last night - its such a small town!  
 
 hey, what do you do at cnrl anyway?

 Good morning Cooper! 
 I've been at work for almost an hour and the synapses are still refusing to jump.  So, a short e-mail break is needed.  
 No, I didn't wind up going to see Black Hawk Down.  My parents are in town from Kuwait so I've been spending time with them.  They've gone soft since going over to Kuwait.  I don't thing I've ever seen two colder people in my life.
 Of COURSE I know Ian Cooke.  I hear he sits right by you at work.  You'll have to tell him I say hi.  
 I don't think this weekend is going to be a very exciting one on my part.  My dad's leaving on Sunday so I'll be doing the family thing most of the time.  Emmy said they're thinking of going to Bass Brothers tomorrow and I think I'll try to go for a couple.  You coming?
 Anyway, I should probably think about working.  Talk to you soon.
