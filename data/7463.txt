 Rick has asked that I schedule a Business Review session with Jeff Skilling 
 early in September.  Jeff is available on September 7 from 10:00 - 11:00.
 The meeting is scheduled for Jeff's office.  If you plan to bring anyone with 
 you to the meeting please let me know and we will need to move to a larger 
 room.
 
 
 
 The meeting will be divided into 3  20 minute sessions:
 
 
 SAP Update   Melissa Becker
 Strategic Sourcing  George Wasaff
 Global Risk Mgmt/Doorstep Sally Beck
