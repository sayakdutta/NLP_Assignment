 
 Attached is a letter that we worked on today and that will be sent to the 
 Governor, CA's US Senators (Boxer/Feinstein), congressional folks, and key 
 Cal state legislators.  It's going out first thing tomorrow AM.  It builds on 
 many of the things we've discussed over the past several months, so there 
 shouldn't be any surprises.  If you've got any concerns please give Paul a 
 call at home or page me at 888.916.7184.

 Attached is a revised draft of the letter reflecting the comments recevied on 
 today's call.  I toned down references to the Secretary's action yesterday, 
 reduced the discussion of caps, and eliminated our response to the "when did 
 you stop beating your dog" question.
