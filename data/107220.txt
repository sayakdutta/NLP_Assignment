 Mark Ellenberg is the N.Y. Cadwalader lawyer who is assisting Houston on a regular basis (he has an office on our floor and is available through our email system).  Mark has asked Michelle Duncan with Cadwalader's U.K. office to contact you to explore the possibility of assisting you with ECTRIC and other trading/bankruptcy issues.  I was thinking that the U.S. process for trade termination/evaluation could be replicated in London and a Cadwalader lawyer (with trading experience) could make use of Mark's experience with pre- and post-filing "Enron" issues.
