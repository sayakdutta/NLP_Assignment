 My assistant, Jan Dobernecker, tells me that Sylvia Sauseda has arranged for 
 an office for you here on the 38th floor.  The room number is EB3850.  Sylvia 
 is in the process of arranging for a telephone and computer for your office 
 and will talk to HR about a badge.  HR should have the badge waiting for you 
 at the desk in the lobby when you arrive.  If it isn't and your HR person is 
 not available, just call Jan Dobernecker at x33427 and she will tell them to 
 let you in.  Sylvia will also attempt to find parking for you.  If you 
 haven't heard from her by Friday, I suggest you park in any of the uncovered 
 lots near the building on Monday morning.  They are more reasonably priced 
 than the garages (which sometimes charge $20 or more for a single day if you 
 don't have a contract).  We're looking forward to seeing you!
 
 Have a good trip.
 
 Mark

 Mark,
 
 All systems ready to go on Friday morning.  I thus expect to be in the office 
 on Monday morning (18 Jan.).  Could you please ask one of the assistants to 
 help in organising and setting up a working station (computer and the rest of 
 the requisite gear).  Also, since it is a bit tricky to establish contact 
 with Houston H/R, this person could perhaps arrange a card/badge for me and a 
 car parking ticket (or advise me where to put the car on Monday morning).
 
 I'm looking forward to seeing you and the rest of the Legal Dept on 18 Jan.
 
 Martin
