 Hope you had an absolutely incredible honeymoon.  I'm sure it was a blast.  The reason I'm writing, actually, is because I left something at the church the night of the wedding.  I thought it had been taken to the country club but the wedding co-ordinators didn't have it.  Basically, it was a white plastic bag with a little kids t-shirt and a little girls shorts & tank top outfit (along with a little hand painted picture).  I bought the clothes in the Caymans for my niece and nephew, so ideally I like to track them down.  I was hoping you could tell me who I should contact about items left in the bridesmaid's room in the church.  I think the bag said The Wharf on the outside if that helps at all.
 
 Thanks,
 Sue
