 All,
 
 Please plan to attend a welcome and overview meeting presented by UBS senior management on Wed. 1/23/02.  The actual meeting is from 10:00am (sharp) - 1:00pm (hopefully just as sharp :) at The Houstonian Hotel on N. Post Oak Ln. at Woodway.  Breakfast munchies will be served at 9am for those of you who think you are as hungry as I am in the morning.  I will be going straight to the meeting from home the morning of, so if you need me call my cell at 713-562-4207.  
 
 Thanks,
 
 Fletch
 
 p.s.  if you know of other former Enron employees that have signed up with UBS and do not know about this meeting, please spread the word.
