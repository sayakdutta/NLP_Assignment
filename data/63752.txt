 
 Hi Mr. Grady -
 
 I did talk to Joe Hillings this morning, who is currently in Philadelphia, 
 and he said that is great for you to attend.  In addition, I did talk to Ken 
 and he said "absolutely", so please plan on it.
 
 Ken and Linda will arrive in Philadelphia tomorrow night.
 
 See you in September.

 Ken:
 
 Greetings from the GOP Convention.  I notice on my master schedule that
 Enron is hosting a cocktail party on Wednesday from 5 to 7.  I was wondering
 two things:
 
 1.  Is it alright if I come by, as a member of the Advisory Committee?  And,
 
 2.  Will I see you there?
 
 Hope all is well and that I will see you in Philadelphia.
 I am staying at the Sheraton University City as a member of the California
 delegation. 215-222-2910.  I am also wearing my Blackberry for 24 x 7 real
 time wireless email access.
 
 Regards,
 
 Bob
