 I think I will give her a call if you agree.  Joylyn's number is
 561-309-0726.  Dad and I will be going to Disney at the Hyatt Regency the
 long weekend of Friday November 9-11 and would like you and Payton to join
 us.  Saturday is a free day for us as well as Sunday.  My event is Friday
 night and Saturday night.
