 
 Eric,
 
 Thank you for your message. The only other message in my mailbox
 from you is dated 6/11/2000 and contains a reference to a resume I cannot
 locate. I checked the log of all the messages and could not find any other
 communication from you.
 
 Please, send a message with a resume again and we shall go from there.

 Dear Mr. Kaminski,
 
         I sent my resume to your well respected company a few weeks ago
 in regards to establishing a long-lasting career with them. I never
 received a response and was wondering if you knew who was in charge of
 the electric power disbatching/scheduling department or know of who I
 may contact to inquire this information? I know you are a very busy
 professional and I apologize for the inconvenience.  Thank you for your
 valuable time.
 
 Warmest Regards,
 Eric Hilton
