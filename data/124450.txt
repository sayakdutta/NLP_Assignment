 
 I have not heard anything from Kevin or Clifford.  Have you spoken to either one of them?
 
 
     
 
 Mark,
 
 Thanks so much for your input and help.  These are truly crazy times for all 
 of us.  I am glad to hear everything is going well with you and your family.  
 That is the upside with all of this mess, I am able to spend a lot more time 
 with Jacob and Alecia.  
 
 Attached please find a copy of my current cv.  I look forward to talking to 
 you soon.
 
 Kind regards,
