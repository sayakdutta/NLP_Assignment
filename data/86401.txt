 Here is the revised draft. I spoke with the Duke attorney and he is
 taking "let me see it and I'll let you know" approach so let me know if
 you have any additional changes and I will send it over to him.
 
 Also, it is my understanding that we must now have a Weil Gotschal
 bankruptcy attorney sign off on the deal
 so I am trying to find out who that person is and what needs to be done.
