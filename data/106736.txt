 
 I am following up with MS but I haven't received your answer.  Will advise 
 when I hear back.  SS
 
 
    
 Do you have any reason to think that Morgan Stanley would not be willing to 
 hold physical Millenium securities as part of their brokerage services they 
 provide for trading in the Millenium stock or do you know if Enron actually 
 prefers to hold physical securities in some particular place?

 If MS can do it thats great.  Is there any problem per MS with the parent 
 CayCo receiving the ADRs and holding them in its sub-account on behalf of 
 PEP?  Perhaps Sara could inquire.  These are physical certifciates (if issued 
 as restricted) so I don't know if the MS account is set up for physical 
 custody or whether we need to prepare some additional documentation.

 BONY has asked us to send them a letter instructing them to issue the ADR(s) 
 and specifying where and to whom to deliver the certificates.  I will prepare 
 the instruction letter, but I am assuming that we want someone at Morgan 
 Stanley to take actual possession of the certificates.  In any event, I need 
 someone to tell me where the certificates should land and give me a physical 
 address for  the certificates.
