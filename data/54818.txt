 Dear Vince Kaminski:
    I enjoyed talking with the Enron representatives at Rice University
 last week and was recommended to contact you regarding my strong interest
 in pursuing a career with Enron Corporation.
    I am a Mathematics Ph.D. student at Rice University and have the
 highest current GPA in the Ph.D. program. I am also gaining knowledge in
 Derivatives Pricing, Risk Management and Hedging at Rice University Jones
 School of Management. I am very interested in an internship and/or
 permanent position with your company beginning in the summer of 2001.
 Enclosed please find a copy of my resume.  I've attached a second copy to
 download, if necessary.
 
 Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Tatiana Marinenko
