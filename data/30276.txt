When Barney presented the ETS budget for the pipeline operations, he included amounts allocated from ETS for IT ($170k) and Accounting ($59k).  You left me a phone mail  message regarding the IT charge and suggested that I contact Caroline Barnes (which I did today).  Both of these appear to be new charges for 2002 and we'd like to get information on what they relate to.  Can you shed some light on the Accounting charge?
 
 Thanks
