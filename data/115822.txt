 
 Just curious - did you ever catch up with Larry Joe Hunter regarding the Long 
 Term Southwest desk's futures deal with Sempra? I'm wondering if I should 
 grab Matt Motley before he goes home today to let him know he needs to get a 
 hold of Tim Cannon about the ADT. Let me know when and if you talk to him.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate
