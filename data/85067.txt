 
 Attached is a draft of the turnkey construction contract for your review.  
 
 Ron,  As we discussed, Exhibit A - Scope of Work will need to be included.  
 Please note the following points:
 
 1.  Liquidated Damages - Need to assess a value for these damages.
 2.  Force Majeure - This would currently provide EE&CC with relief from the 
 In-Service Date requirements and consequently, the LDs.  Is this acceptable?
 3.  Permitting - Need to specify in Exhibit F, those permits that ENA would 
 secure, and make EE&CC responsible for any others.
 4.  Utility Coordination - Currently this is very generally.  Are there 
 specific responsibilities that should be stated in this Agreement wrt the 
 Utility?
 
 Please review with these in mind.  I will be out tommorrow and Friday.  Let's 
 plan on meeting Monday to discuss the draft.
