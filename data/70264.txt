 Heather and Ozzie
 We just concluded a review of the agreement documents and noted all changes,
 corrections, etc. to make it in compliance with discussions last Tuesday
 which resolved all/most of the business issues. 
  Jackie Scheib has committed to red line the agreement that was sent to us
 last night, to be in accordance with our internal review this afternoon, and
 to get it out sometime over the weekend to FCE and to Enron.  At the same
 time we are trying to finalize the attachments (exhibits) for early next
 week. 
 I suggest we each review the red line on Monday and set up conf call late
 Monday or Tues am to resolve any outstanding business issues or
 "wordsmithing", so we can try to get this behind us.
