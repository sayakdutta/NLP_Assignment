 In Phase I we had the copyright notice on every page.  Can we get away with 
 having it only on the home page?

 The copyright notice on the homepage should read as follows:
 
 Copyright (c) 1999 Enron Net Works LLC.  All rights reserved.
 
 (the "C" is actually the little c in the circle).  We had also suggested that 
 we indicate "Patent Pending" close to the copyright notice.
