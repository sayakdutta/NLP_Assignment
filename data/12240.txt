 
 John, this is a short note to let you know where we stand on the  7 mile 
 pipeline construction Rogas Project with respect to environmental  permitting 
 and approvals.
 
 The following documents and applications have been submitted to the agencies:
 
  California fish and game 1603 application
 
  Kern County Floodplain Management Agency-encroachment application
 
  US COE 404 Nationwide permit- preconstruction notification
 
  Reclamation Board- encroachment application
 
  Califonia State Fire Marshall-waiver to install aboveground pipeline
 
  Office of Pipeline Safety-waiver to Install aboveground pipeline
 
 I am checking to see what state requirements there are for SHPO clearances 
 for this project.  I would suspect that they would  want us to do a field 
 survey prior to construction.  It seems that every Califonia state and county 
 agency is a candidate for notification or approval.   Ill keep you 
 apprised......
