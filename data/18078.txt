 With the on-going discussions in CA, we need to make sure that we understand 
 what would happen if a core / non-core split were implemented.
 
 Basically, what is the 1 year, 3 year, and 5 year price for a E-19 and E-20 
 customer with a typical load profile?  Has to be all in (as if EES were 
 selling gen only service).
 
 Give me a call if this does not make sense.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Jim
