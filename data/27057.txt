 1.   The actual shift change occurs at 6 am until further,  however,  I expect traders to arrive at least 20 minutes before shift change.
 2  the September work schedule is attached
 3.  I understand that most park in daily fee, "outside" lots.
 
 
 Thanks,
 JMF 
 
  
     
 John, 
 
 Good morning.  Just wanted to pose a couple of questions that I was thinking about this weekend.  First, does the shift begin at 5:30or 6?  I know you had mentioned that you may change the hours.  If you know, what is the general consensus for those  individuals working night and days, as far as parking is concerned. Lastly, please forward me the September schedule when you get a chance?   
 
 Thanks John, I'm looking forward to coming up!!!  George
