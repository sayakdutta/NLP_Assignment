 
 Gary,
 
 We spoke last week about opportunities that your company currently has open.  Currently, I am making markets on Enron Online for the PJM cash and term off peak market.  In addition, I still manage the Northeast Physical book for the Northeast (PJM, NYISO, and NEPOOL) and manage the Northeast real time trading desk.  I also have participated in the PJM FTR and NYISO TCC market in my tenure here at Enron.  
 The opportunities that I would most be interested are those located here in the Houston area.  My second choice would then be those positions located in Florida.  I look forward to talking to you soon.
