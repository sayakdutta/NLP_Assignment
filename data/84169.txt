 
 Based on the current draft of the O&M agreement, we do have the ability to 
 (i) terminate each agreement for a one time fee of $200,000, or (ii) suspend 
 all or a portion of the O&M services for a period of time and the parties 
 would then meet to determine a mutually agreeable adjustment to the then 
 current Operating Fee.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 Could you please answer Question #2 for RAC's Chip Schneider.  Let me know 
 once you have talked to him.
 
 Thanks,

 In considering the worst case scenario...
 
 The Force Majeure provision seems reasonably broad in the Steam Purchase 
 Agreement.  Would we be able to rely on this at some point to suspend our 
 steam supply to AKF in the event, for unforseen reasons, we could not obtain 
 an Interconnection Agreement or transmission capacity to transport power from 
 Elizabethtown and Lumberton?
 Also, if it were determined that we could not sell power from the sites, can 
 we terminate or downsize the scope of the O&M Agreement?
 
 Regards,
