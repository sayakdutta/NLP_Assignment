 The attached file contains CES's first-of-the-month daily volume requirements
 for August 2000.  This request is submitted 3 business days prior to NYMEX
 close for the month of August.   The file contains volumes to be delivered to
 the citygate as well as volumes to be injected into storage consistent with 
 the
 theoretical storage injection schedule.
 
 
 Please note that for the month of August '00 CES is not purchasing additional
 volumes of gas from Enron for delivery to MME behind COH under a separate 
 deal,
 as was done in June and July.   Also, CES is not ordering any volumes in 
 August
 for Honeywell (formerly Allied Signal) which ceased to be a CES customer at 
 the
 end of March 2000.
 
 
 Please call me if you have questions or problems with the attached request.
