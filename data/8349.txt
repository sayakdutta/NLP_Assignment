I will have copies of the floor plans for 5 and 6 sometime this morning -- we should determine best placement for these.  --Sally

 Sally,  it doesn't appear that the fax machines already in ECS will be sufficient for your needs.  Let me know if you would like us to assist your group in getting additional fax machines.  I have to believe that there are numerous excess machines around here.   JR
 
  
     
 Jenny --
 
 There are 25 owned and 6 leased fax machines on ECS 05 & 06 per the UBS asset scheduled.  After doing a walk though on the floors, the machines are concentrated in certain business areas.  Current machine placement will not accommodate the type of usage that I suspect Sally's group will need to have.
 
 My suggestion is that the settlements group(s) bring their fax machines with them, and we have the numbers changed.
