 Kevin,
 
 Here are the examples we talked about
 
 Assumptions:
 

 2.  We put out a COB/MC market $4 at $7.
 3.  In EOL, Product 1 = COB and Product 2 = MC.
 
 Here's what will happen in the broker market:
 
 (A) If someone hits my bid of $4 in the broker market I will BUY COB at something like $35, and I will SELL Mid-C at $31.
 (B) If someone lifts my offer of $7 in the broker market I will SELL COB at something like $35, and I will BUY Mid-C at $28.
 
 If you take the same assumptions and show this market on EOL, here's my understanding of what will happen:
 
 (C) If someone hits my bid of $4 on EOL, I will SELL COB at $35, and I will BUY MC at $39 (compare this with (A))
 (D) If someone lifts my offer of $7 on EOL, I will BUY COB at $35, and I will SELL MC at $42 (compare this with (B)).
 
 Clearly this doesn't work.
 

 
 (E)  If someone hits my bid of $4 on EOL, I will SELL MC at $35, and I will BUY COB at $39 (achieves same result as (A), which is what we want).
 (F)  If someone lifts my offer of $7 on EOL, I will BUY MC at $35, and I will SELL COB at $42 (achieves the same result as (B), which is what we want).
 
 I realize (E) and (F) don't jive with our long contract description, but conceptually it works.
 
 If you have any questions, let me know.
