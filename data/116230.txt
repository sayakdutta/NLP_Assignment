 
 I've made a change to a LTNW deal, per Mike Driscoll and John Malowney, 
 because it was entered against the wrong index yesterday. Cara asked me to 
 e-mail you with the specifics for any scheduling adjustments that need to be 
 made. And here they are -
 
 563929 - KILLED
 
 476578 - Legs 4, 5, and 6 added to extend deal through April
 
 Because this is an index-forward deal, it needed to be entered against the 
 on-peak, off-peak, and Sunday indices, which explains the three new legs. Let 
 me know if you have any questions.
