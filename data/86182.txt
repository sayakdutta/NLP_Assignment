 The following ad is reported to have gotten numerous calls...
 
 
 SINGLE BLACK FEMALE... Seeks male companionship, ethnicity
 unimportant. I'm a svelte good looking girl who LOVES to play.
 I love long walks in the woods, riding in your pickup truck,
 hunting, camping, and fishing trips, cozy winter nights lying by
 the fire. Candlelight dinners will have me eating out of your
 hand. Rub me the right way and watch me respond.
 I'll be at the front door when you get home from work, wearing
 only what nature gave me. Kiss me and I'm yours.
 Call xxx-xxxx and ask for Daisy.
 Callers found themselves talking to the local Humane Society
 about an eight-week-old black Lab.
