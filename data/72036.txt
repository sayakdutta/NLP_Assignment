 I think we should do a phone conference to resolve the outstanding issues 
 regarding the engagement of "local lobbying firms" by ENA.  I will schedule a 
 call for tomorrow at 10:30am (cst).  Please advise if that time works with 
 your schedule.  Thanks.

 Hi Marchris,
 
 I'm in ENA Legal, and I'm looking for the right person to discuss this with.  
 Christi Nicholay suggested I get you involved.  Please give me a call at 713 
 345 7566 to discuss.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay

 OK. This guy's a lawyer by training, but we're hiring him as a lobbyist. 
 Roger was previously looking into this, and proposed our standard form 
 agreement. Steve and I were wondering if we could work off of Tripp Scott's 
 proposed form, considering that he will not be representing us as our counsel.
 
 Please let me know.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Ben

 Ben,
 
 What are these folks supposed to do for Enron?  I had heard a rumor that we 
 were looking to hire someone to lobby for us on a success fee basis.  Is this 
 the same deal?  I know on the international side there were hoops to jump 
 through before such an engagement could be signed off on.  I'll have to check 
 to see what the drill is on this side of the street.

 Per my earlier e-mail, attached is Tripp Scott's form.

 As discussed, Roger has no problem engaging Tripp Scott.  He does want to use 
 Enron's standard 9 page engagement letter in lieu of the attached 2 pager 
 received from Tripp Scott.  Is this necessary - any thoughts?

 As discussed in Fort Pierce, Tripp Scott is that insurance policy I've been 
 looking for to help secure the commission vote in Pompano.  Tripp Scott will 
 also assist us in our door knock campaign in the County & Tallahassee.  
 Pozzuoli is a mover & shaker and is on a first name basis with Jeb Bush -  he 
 was the Chairman for the Bush/Cheny Broward County re-count.
 
 Bill Keith & Debbie Orshefsky highly recommends the engagement.
 
 Lets discuss Tuesday.

 It was a pleasure meeting with you and Debbie on Monday afternoon.  Per our 
 discussion, enclosed is Tripp Scott's proposed terms of engagement as well as 
 an abbreviated description of the firm and its key directors.
 
 I look forward to speaking with you soon.
