 	My relo expenses have not been turned in as yet.    Do I turn those in to you?     I am due the closing costs, etc.  due to my move from Portland.
 Also,   Johnny Palmer was very pleasant to speak with.    I appreciate the effort that you have made in trying to generate interest in me from the inside.
 Johnny, however,   was not optimistic that he had anything available for a Director level position. 
 	  I have been talking with Portland (Greg Wolfe,  Tim Belden,  and Amy Fitzpatrick)    If nothing opens up here by Wednesday,   I need to get out to the West and start training so that I can make some money for the company.
 I am still building,  staffing, & trading for the Ercot region,  but I am eager to go quickly if no one wants me in Houston.    
 
 Thanks!
