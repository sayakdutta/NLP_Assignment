 Dear Sareen
 
 Thank you for the marked up finalised version of the CA to be dated 26 
 February 2001. I confirm it is in order and attach herewith a clean version 
 incorporating all your amendments. Please note that I have added Clay Harris' 
 name and title to the execution clause.
 
 As discussed, since our authorised signatories will be in different places, 
 we will execute the CA in counterparts as follows:
 
 1. You will print the attached CA for your Mr Muri Mohammad who will sign 
 them on Monday in KL.
 
 2. The signed CA will be faxed to you in London on Monday which you will 
 deliver our Mr Clay Harris. 
 A copy will also be faxed to me on Monday.
 
 3. You will leave intructions for the original CA signed by Mr Muri Mohammad 
 to be couriered to me in Singapore which I should receive by Tuesday. 
 
 4. Our Mr Clay Harris will sign a counterpart CA and will deliver the 
 original to you on Monday in exchange for the faxed counterpart signed by Mr
