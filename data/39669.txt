 We were unable to convince Morgan Stanley's counsel to provide the Affidavit 
 in support of our position by the noon deadline today.  He said that although 
 the traders were OK, he needed to track down internal approvals over the next 
 few days.  Notwithstanding the deadline, it would still be extremely helpful 
 to our case if we received the Affidavit over the next couple of days.  We 
 would file the Affidavit, and deal with the judge, hopefully convincing him 
 to allow the Affidavit notwithstanding the deadlines he established (there is 
 a good likelihood he would do so).  As mentioned it would be very helpful if 
 we weren't the only party advocating the need for a comprehensive index 
 before the judge.  Accordingly, if you have any residual pressure to bear on 
 MS, it would be greatly appreciated.
 
 Peter.
