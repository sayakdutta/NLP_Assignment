 Please ignore the transfer payment example I sent earlier in the day.  When 
 we were unable to talk on the phone, I kept working on the example and added 
 panels to show each step in the process.   I have also prepared a short note 
 to describe the pricing provisions of the Transmission Operating Agreement 
 which trigger the transfer payments.  The spreadsheet has notes which explain 
 the process.  It also assumes that a volumetric export fee is not added.  
 Hopefully we can find a time to talk about these documents to make sure I 
 have communitcated the issue.
