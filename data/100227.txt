 Jim, where do we charge the Deer Park costs incurred prior to turning it over to Midcon?  We provided them all the engineering and ROW performed to date.
 
    
 	   		
 
 
   
  
 We have spent $ 35,729 at Deer Park and $ 9,627 at Flagstaff. I will advise you about the ROW costs when I receive them from Towles.
                                                                                         Tom Fry
