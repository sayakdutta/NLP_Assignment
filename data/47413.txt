 counterparties trading weather?

 hi tana
 
 they're fine for non US & Canadian based products (including physical power) 
 - the standard exceptions would be US power, weather and credit derivatives

 As an introduction:  The referenced counterparty is trying to straighten out 
 the online products it wants to trade with us (it's open for some, but not 
 all of the products it wants to trade).
 
 When I looked at Profile Manager to see what they had already been approved 
 to trade, I noticed that this counterparty was opened to trade many of the 
 European products, including specifically European physical power products 
 (which is unusual for a US based counterparty to trade).
 
 Before I go in and change the profile for this counterparty, I wanted to 
 check with you and see if London had specifically opened them to trade the 
 products they were opened to trade (especially physical power).
 
 What I usually do when I am approving US based counterparties, is that with 
 respect to Non Us & Canadian products, as long as they are an Eligible Swap 
 Participant I open them up for all products except European physical power, 
 which I never open them for.  Also, Credit Derivatives, I never open anyone 
 up for unless we really mean it.
 
 So, my question to you is did London actively approve the non US & Canadian 
 based products (especially physical power).  If you didn't, then I am going 
 to take this as an oversight of the pre-approval process and shut them down 
 for European physical power.
