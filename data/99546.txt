 I'm not sure how much money is in the fund for these types of events, but it may help get our name out there.

 > once again hosting the 6th annual Mid-C Marketing Seminar here in
 > Wenatchee. The dates are July 9th for a semi-pro baseball game & BBQ, July
 > 10th for the meeting and July 11th for a golf tournament. I realize this
 > is an early request, but helps with the logistics as we approach the

 > Last year, your company helped us by making a donation in the amount of
 > $500.00 toward sponsorship of the golf tournament. That was very
 > beneficial to Mid-C Services, played a large part in the success of  the
 > seminar and we appreciated it very much.
 >  
 > We are offering you the same opportunity this year. Chelan PUD cannot
 > legally sponsor this tournament, so your participation is important.
 > Please don't feel obligated, but if this works for you, we will publicize
 > your sponsorship as much as possible during the 2-day event.
 > 
 > Most importantly, we want you to join us and participate in the learning
 > and fun. Please respond to me at your convenience.

 > Thank You, Doug
