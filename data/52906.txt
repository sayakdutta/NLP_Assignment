 
 Hello,
 
 Thanks for your message. I think that we can resume our discussions in a few
 months. We have currently a large group of highly skilled Enron employees
 who, given that we have effectively an internal labor market, are looking for alternative
 positions. We are giving them a priority in the hiring decisions.

 Vince,
 
 How are you doing?  I am following up with the conference-call interview
 last Monday. Could you let me know if you think we should pursue further
 discussions?  Thanks for your consideration.

 Vince, Paulo, Alex, Bob:
 
 It was a pleasure speaking to you today and I got valuable insight into the
 Enron Research Group.  I believe my background in swap and options trading,
 fixed income risk management, and model validation can add value to the
 group.  The work you described is very attractive and I hope we have the
 opportunity to pursue further discussions.  Again, thank you for your time
 and I look forward to your decision.
 
 Regards,
