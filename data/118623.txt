 We need to act on this today - what is your advice on how we proceed based on 
 the fact that they clearly appear to be in breach.

 Louise, the contract is clear on this.  Here is what is states in ATTACHMENT 
 A - AMENDMENTS TO AGREEMENT
 
 a.  Publicity
 
 "Contractor shall never reference Company in any advertising or publicity 
 without its written consent.  Specifically, no reference must be made to 
 Company or any of its affiliates in any form of communication, wither verbal 
 or written or through any other media, including but not limited to printed 
 advertising or marketing materials, oral or print presentations, digital or 
 online media, or any other reference whatsoever to Company without the 
 express prior written consent of Company.".
 
 Let me know if you need anything additional

 Could you both please verify that the following use of our name is a breach 
 of contract on Agency's side.  They also want to do a press release which we 
 have not agreed to and I will be saying no to this on Monday.  I would like 
 to follow this with some legal reponse to this breach in contract immediately 
 - ie tomorrow.
 
 Let me know what you think.
 
 Louise
