 The attorney's are done with the documents.  I have a call in with Pauline to schedule a meeting to sign them.  Most likely in Columbus.  I am waiting to hear from her.

 Phillip,
 
 I spoke with Doug Bell this AM.  He says AMHP got their letter from the
 school last Thurs.  Now they are getting a letter from Sam Olguin for an
 easement.  So the ball is back in his court.  Once that happens the deal can
 close.
 
 
 What's up with  Seguin?
 
 
 Thanks.
