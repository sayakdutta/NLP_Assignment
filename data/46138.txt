 
 Your call to Mark Taylor in Houston Legal was forwarded to me for response.  
 Mark is on vacation in Germany until the end of next week.  Per your 
 voicemail, you has some US market descriptions that you need to have 
 reviewed.  I just left Mark a voicemail on his cell phone, I'm not sure if I 
 will hear from him tonight or not.  If youcould email or fax me the 
 document/information you need reviewed, I will run it by Mark as soon as I 
 hear back from him.  I'm sorry I can't be of more help for the immediate 
 moment, but I will respond as soon as I hear from Mark.
