 We are getting calls from our brokers and the NYMEX telling us the brokers 
 still have not received notification of our name change.  This is causing 
 problems with the brokers clearing the trades on the NYMEX.  Per my voicemail 
 several weeks ago, since you/your desk are our communications guy with the 
 brokers,  they need to receive the notice as soon as possible.   When will 
 you be able to get this notice our of our name change?
