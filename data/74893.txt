 
 My dad is having some health issues, so they couldn't commit to next week.  I 
 cleared cancelling the conference with Elizabeth, so please take the steps 
 necessary to call that off.  Carlos' wife is due the 23rd, so I may need to 
 cover for  him.  We'll see.  I do hope to take Michael and Rosco to Palacios 
 where we can hang out, fish, play in the sand, etc.  In other words, no big 
 plans, which I'm happy about.  I think Neil will miss Rosco as much as 
 Michael, but he probably looks forward to having the house to himself for a 
 few days.

 Anything on the conference yet?  Aren't you going to see your dad with 
 Michael next week?

 Just a reminder that I am planning on being on vacation with my son next 
 week.  My clients are aware of these plans, and I have hopes that things will 
 go without a hitch.  I will be able to retrieve email and voice mail.
