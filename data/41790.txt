 BP Amoco and Dynegy both involve ECC.

 Marie - I have been involved in seeing that the proper security notices are being registered in respect of the PG&E master netting agreement as it involves Enron Canada.  Just today I became aware that the master netting agreement with Reliant involves Enron Canada as well.  Greg Johnston and I will see that the proper Canadian registrations are made for the Reliant agreement.
 
 Please let me know if there are any other agreement that involve Canadian Enron entities (BP Amoco I believe may).

 Chris

 Marie, can you and Chris make sure that you are on the same page with agreements affecting Canada, especially as it relates to registering security notices.
 
 Peter.
 
  
     
 Per Carol's request, please e-mail Carol, Mary and me with an update on the agreements you are working on.
 
 Thanks!
