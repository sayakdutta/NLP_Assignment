 Errol,
 Is it possible for me to get a report of option positions broken out by greeks and strike concentration?  Also, I would like to know if it is possible for you to give me the financial desk's average gamma exposure over the last 6 months.  Trying to get "handle" on typical exposures?
 
 Thanks,
 Frank
