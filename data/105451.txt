 Enron Corp. has a 1/17/92 Interest Rate and Currency Exchange master wtih 
 Paribas.  I will fax to you the letter which I received regarding the above 
 merger.  Basically, Enron Corp.'s signature to this letter will indicate 
 agreement to put all [existing, if any, and future] Transactions under this 
 master but with all obligations becoming those of the surviving entity which 
 is BNP and which changed its name to "BNP Paribas."
 
 Do you have any credit issues?
