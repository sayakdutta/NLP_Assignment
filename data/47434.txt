 
 TFS was sent out but has not came back in signed.  I was out yesterday, so 
 Spectron has not gone out.  I have that on my list to do today.

 Tana,
 Can I just get a status report on the NDA that you've sent out for me.  I 
 want to verify that Spectron and TFS have not executed the NDA yet.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Dan
