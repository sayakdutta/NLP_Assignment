 sure it's been resolved. Sound familiar?

 Stewart called last Friday and said there would be some deals for the City of 
 Roseville to be confirmed.  He did not have deal numbers for these deals, and 
 so far, I have not seen any deals for this counterparty.  Do you know 
 anything about these deals?  Can check around and see if anyone else knows 
 about them?
 
 Thanks!
