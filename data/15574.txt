 
 Please don't use this yet.  Refinements are underway by Alan Comnes, but 
 wanted to give you a flavor for how underwater the DWR contracts are (if 
 marked to market today).  Jim's got it , too.
 
 Based on recent curves, $21B of the DWR contracts are stranded.  Will give 
 you the update once it's done (likely tomorrow).
 
 Best,
 Jeff
