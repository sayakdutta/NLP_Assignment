 
 the lsu game rocked.  davey hasn't been playing b/c he has been hurt.  if he 
 would have played last week we would have beat uab.  denver defense sucks.  
 that game made me sick.  i can do can cun for sure.  just let me know the 
 dates.  what happened to cu?  i heard marcus houston hurt his hip.
