 Are you alright with AIG disclosing transaction terms to a third party as a possible assignee of those trades?  If so, David and I can have the confidentiality provisions of the GTC's waived for this purpose and we can proceed.  
 
 Thanks.  Sara
 
  

  
 
 Dear Sara:
 
 I've drafted two simple forms of waiver for each of Enron North America
 Corp. and Enron Power Marketing, Inc.  If these are acceptable we can fax
 them to you in the morning.  Thanks for your help with this.

 Contact details below.  Please propose a form of waiver.  I'll talk to
