 Attached is a draft blackline and clean copy of the Edgecombe PPA.  We did not
 address the issue of security in this draft, but still regard it as an open 
 item
 subject to further discussion.
 
 We look forward to receiving the information on the fuel arrangements, 
 equipment
 specifications and construction cost estimates so we can better evaluate the
 proposal you presented last Thursday.
