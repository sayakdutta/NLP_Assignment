 available, I'm happy to participate.  The scheduling problem is due to my 
 travel plans.  I'll join in if the call is at a time I can fit in.  
 Otherwise, I'll catch up with you later about the results of the call.

 My comment was really directed toward outside counsel. As you know, you're 
 always welcome...

 OK.  Friday was going to be really difficult for me anyway.

 Fred:
 
 I think it's premature to have legal on the line. If they have specific 
 comments on the docs, they need to send them to us and we can quickly get 
 back to them. If they want to have a commercial discussion, we can proceed 
 without legal.
 
 Thanks,

 I spoke to NRG this morning.  They would like to arrange a conference call 
 for Friday (most likely in the morning) to discuss the proposed transaction 
 involving the GE 7EA.  Are you available to call in from New York?  If not, 
 can Carolyn Campbell sit in for you on the call?
 
 Let me know sometime today.  
 
 Thanks,
 Fred
