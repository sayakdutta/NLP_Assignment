 
 Can't I say Hello to Mandy without a specific reason for doing so?  Actually, 
 you copied me on a joke email earlier in the week.  Just thought I would see 
 if you would talk to me.

 still no word on the Hawaii job yet --
 Just got word that I'm number one pick for the Pennzoil job, but that they
 wouldn't be ready to do anything until after the first of the year, which
 is fine by me.
 I'm going to London 1/10 through 1/16 - did I tell you that arleady?
 
 so, you didn't answer my question:  what made you say hello all of a
 sudden?  I thought you were gone for good.

 No.  I am actually pretty busy these days.  They expect work out of me.
 Imagine that.  How goes the job search?  Found that position in Hawaii yet?
