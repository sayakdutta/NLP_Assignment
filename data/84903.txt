 
 Tracy,  
 
 Thanks for the pictures.  Cute kid.  Frank does look like you.  I need to 
 come by and see Frank in person.  Sorry that I have been out of the loop for 
 some time but sometimes life is weird.  
 
 I am sure Tom told you that Lisa and I are getting divorced.  It is still 
 hard for me to comprehend this, but all I can do is continue to move forward 
 with my life.  Anyway, hope to see you guys soon sometime and keep sending 
 pictures.   
 
 Gerald
