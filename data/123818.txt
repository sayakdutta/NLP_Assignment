 Looks good - you mention month-end deadlines.  You also might want to mention the work that goes on during month-end close and how that could potentially affect trading P&L.

 If you wouldn't mind, have a quick glance over the spreadsheet and see if there is anything I missed that you think should be mentioned. This is for the training class and I was just trying to hit on all the main areas which is not in any particular order right now. It is a general overview, so not too detailed.
