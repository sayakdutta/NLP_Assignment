      It was really a pleasure to talk to you after so many years.  Whenever
 you have a chance to come to New York, please let me know so maybe you
 could come to spend a few days in my home in Greenwich or I could go to New
 York to meet you there.
 
      Thank you for your help regarding book references, and also for a
 possible reference regarding a quant to cover energy trading in Market Risk
 Management Department that I run at AIG Trading Group.
 
      Please say the best greeting to all your family, talk to you soon.
 
 Richard
