 If we aren't doing your mom's thing Friday night- then I am going to study Friday night.  Feel free to go if you want- but I really need to get some studying done- the exam is in less than a month.

 Hey Goofs - 
 
 This Friday is Moni's 25th birthday.  We're celebrating with dinner at 8:00
 p.m. at Bossa, and then heading to Slainte and The Mercury Room.  We'll also
 most likely go to Bar Houston so we can get Moni to dance on the bar.  I
 hope you guys can make it.  I haven't seen you two in forever! 
 
 P.S. - Eric, do you remember the name of the hotel that the four of us
 stayed at when we went to the Texas game last year?
