 schedule activity, basically just took the applicable Enron monthly schedule
 from the contract package and added it to the WAPA hydro monthly schedule, I
 have given your Name/number to Lynn Garrett who is our WAPA POC for this,
 the Enron allocation (per contract) must be 25% green energy, certifable
 with green tags for use at Edwards.  
 I'll be in touch,

 Paul,
 Attached is the December model  which shows EAFB approx. 574 MWh short
 on Mid-Peak and 1345 MWh long on Off-Peak. I intend to monitor it every
 couple days to see how this years load compares to last year and perhaps
 we can make an adjustment accordingly. I have also attached the Hydro
 schedule I sent to WAPA and SCE. As Elliot mentioned, we will continue
 to keep you posted as developments occur here at Enron. 
 Regards,
 Jesse
