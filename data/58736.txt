 
 I like Jim to make these calls because he is up to date on the legal community and our interests there.  Put in the request and send to Eliz, then we'll put it in front of derrick.
 
 
     
 
 Justice Jefferson is the first African American Justice on the Texas Supreme Court.  He practiced appellate law (he has twice argued and won before the U. S. Supreme Court.)  He is very well respected.  
  
 He called me late Tuesday asking for a campaign contribution.  I called Jim Derrick who is traveling until Friday.  Jim indicated that he was supporting Justice Jefferson.  
  
 Do we give money from our PAC budget for Supreme Court Justices or does that go through Jim? I need to return Justice Jefferson's call and let him know if we can support him. What do you think?  Thanks, Jean

 What do you know about this guy? 
 
  
     
 
 Hi, Steve.  I hope all is well. 
 
 Jeff wanted me to ask you about Wallis Jefferson.  Apparently, he's running 
 for Texas Supreme Court and he wanted to know if this guy "lives the 
 values," so to speak.  He hasn't called him yet, but just wanted your 
 perspective on him when you have a chance. 
 
 Jeff is traveling at the moment, but you can e-mail me or Jeff directly at 

 
 Thanks for your help.  SRS
