 Richard and Elizabeth,
 
 At Christian's suggestion, I am sending a memo I prepared summarizing some of 
 the more exotic strategies used by our traders.  Christian has reviewed the 
 memorandum and believes that it will assist you both in preparing for our 
 Thursday meeting.  Between now and Thursday, Christian and I are going to 
 analyze the ISO tariff to determine if the tariff prohibits any of these 
 strategies.
 
 Steve
