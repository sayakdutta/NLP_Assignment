 Guinn, is the best person to answer these issues. Her ext is 36104. By the 
 way, we are not revising our policies.

 Richard:  We have learned from Bob Williams that you are in the process of 
 updating ENA's document retention policy.  What will the policy be with 
 regard to retaining drafts of agreements after a particular transaction has 
 closed?  It is our understanding that ENA's current policy is to discard all 
 drafts post-closing.   We are in the process of formalizing our own document 
 retention policy, and want to ensure that our practices line up with ENA's.  
 Please advise.  Marianne (EES Legal)
