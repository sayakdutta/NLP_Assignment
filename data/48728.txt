 Dear Vince:
 
      Happy New Year.
 
       Does Enron have a program for hiring summer interns?  My daughter
 Candice Kao is a freshman at Mount Holyoke College.  She has a good quan
 aptitude and quite meticulous.  She is looking for summer intership in
 Houston.  So if you know such a program existing, please let me know.
 She is in town for the semester break if there is such a program, may
 be she can visit with someone there to have an interview.
 
       With best regards,  Ed
