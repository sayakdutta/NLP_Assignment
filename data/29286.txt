 You probably need to look at this.This only addresses expenditure approval 
 and does not address "execution" authority. Sometimes non VPs believe that if 
 they can approve the expenditure then they can sign contracts in connection 
 with the expenditure even in the absence of a power of attorney. Accordingly 
 it might be wise to expand the "Delegation" section of this policy.
