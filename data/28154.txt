 By now I'm sure that you've heard about the upcoming electric industry class 
 that has been customized for GPG staff.   The purpose of the class is to 
 learn about electric utilities as our customers, learn about some of the 
 current regulatory and legislative debates and the impact on us, and to learn 
 about the economics of electric generation.   
 
 The class will be held on August 25 at the Downtown Houston Doubletree Hotel, 
 Granger Rooms A & B  from 8-5 PM.  Stan Horton will open the class with 
 remarks on why he believes GPG needs to learns about economics and trends in 
 the electric industry.  The class includes a full day of course work and a 
 working lunch will be served.   A  workbook is being prepared and will be 
 distributed to you a week prior to the class.  
 
 I hope you can attend.  Similar industry classes can cost upwards of $600 per 
 student.   Our customized class can accommodate up to 100 attendees.   Please 
 RSVP to Ruth Mann by email by August 8 if you plan to attend.  Once I get a 
 count of attendees from this list, I will open the class up to other GPG 
 attendees.
