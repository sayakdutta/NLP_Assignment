 
 Chris,
 
 I was about to send off the info from the prior email when I received your latest update.  However, I'm confused by the update.  The form seems to be the same, except it is intended to be sent to the Republic of Kazakhstan in New York.  Is that really where we are sending our registration information?  What about the autobiography.  What is that, What is required?  
 
 I understand the urgency in registering and am prepared to do what it takes to accomplish this today.  But, frankly this whole process was a surprise to me.  Does your agency have an written materials on follow-up requirements/processes in general.  I'm sort of at a loss on the whole issue of what comes next.  When to apply for SS#.  What about readoption.  Passport, Certificate of Citizenship, etc.  I was surprised when a resident alien card arrived.
 
 I need to take care of the registration issue today, as we will be on vacation starting tomorrow for a week.

 Dear Families,
 Rod Archer gave me a better place for you to download the Registration form 
 for the Embassy. When you get to the page go to #4 and you can download the 
 Form so that it is easy to read and print.Thanks again.
