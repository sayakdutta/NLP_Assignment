 				 Coordination Group Meeting
 
 				You, or a representative from your
 organization, are invited to attend a meeting on June 14, 2001 from 10am to
 12pm in our offices. It has been some time since the group has met and in
 the mean time we have put some processes in place to address the ongoing
 supply adequacy concerns within Alberta. Thank you for your support. We
 would like to review how the current processes are working and examine areas
 for improvement. We have proposed the following agenda.
 
 *	Review of current coordination practices
 *	Information posting practices
 *	System Controller practices - re: coordination
 *	Information requirements for 2002 - update of maintenance by October
 *	System Restoration requirements
 *	Other issues?
 
 				Please confirm your attendance by June 8,
 2001. If you are unable to attend, perhaps you would like to be telephone
 conferenced into the meeting. Please confirm.
 				Also, please advise if you have any other
 agenda items.
 
 				Thanks.
