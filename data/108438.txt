 John:
  I want to bring a matter to your attention. Last week I went to see Canadian 
 Steamship Lines. Prior to my visit I asked Vikas, the middle marketing 
 associate, to contact Singapore and get quarterly offers for IFO 180. Vikas 
 emailed Hans Wong three times.  He also called twice. I also asked  Sarah 
 Mulholland to call Singapore on Friday prior to start of my meeting. She 
 could not reach Hans either in the office or on his cell phone. We finally 
 received some numbers Monday morning, obviously too late for our client 
 meeting.
 
 I understand that you have been working very hard to increase responsiveness 
 and market development for crude and products.  With this in mind, I  believe 
 have a partial solution  that will prove beneficial to all. On the EGM 
 fundamentals page I intend to include a section where the mids of all 
 products will be posted based on the day's close. I think this would help 
 everyone stay on top of the various markets and products around the world.
 
 Thanks for your attention to this matter.
 
 
 Jen
