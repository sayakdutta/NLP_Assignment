 Pat,
 
 That's a good question. Actually we are still defining prices with Eden to 
 see what we are going to offer Siderca.
 
 Following steps:
 Eden and Enron to agree on structure and pricing;
 Eden will present the structure to Siderca;
 Siderca has to agree to the proposed structure and prices and will start 
 negotiating documents.
 
 I suggest that we hold on until we agree with Eden on point 1, and once that 
 is decided, we can start working on it.
 
 Regards,
 
 Rolo

 Rolo-
 
 Where are you with this deal?  We will need to have underwriting become 
 involved if you are looking at paying 12MM up front.
 
 Please let me know when you are ready to have a conference call with 
 underwriting and myself to discuss this deal in detail.
 
 Regards,
 
 Pat

 Pat,
 
 Fede and I met this morning with Eden. For the time being, we are going to 
 work with them on another deal (which I will explain below) and we will 
 suspend the Swap deal that we were currently working on..
 
 Eden - Siderca - Enron Deal
 
 Eden has a full-requirement PPA (140MW) with a TOP of around 50 MWs with 
 Siderca that ends on May 31st, 2006. The contract price is approximately $30 
 /Mwh (adjusted with a formula) clearly out of the money.   The contract also 
 states that Siderca will have to pay $12MM penalty to Eden in the event 
 Siderca wants to early terminate the contract. We have proposed to Eden the 
 following structure:
 
 Enron will pay Eden an upfront payment of $12MM so that Eden terminates the 
 contract with Siderca, and then Enron can transact with Siderca. Enron will 
 sign a MSA with Siderca selling (financially) for around 70 MW flat during 
 the term of the agreement.
 Enron will sign a MSA with a Generator (possibly CTSN - an AES Co. - or 
 Central Puerto) to buy (financially) 70 MW flat during the term of the 
 agreement.

 prices.
 Term of the agreement: Nov '99 - March '06.
 
 One important point is to determine what will the concept for the Upfront 
 Payment that Enron will make to Eden. Fede and I
 thought about two options:
 Dummy Option or,
 Direct Payment to the Main Shareholders of Eden on an off-shore basis
 
 I am attaching a slide were the transaction is described. If you have any 
 questions about the deal structure, do not hesitate to call either Fede or 
 myself.
