 re-ending is my thing, it's soooooo California, yea I'm gonna get re-ended as 
 soon as possible.  I'm not even gonna wait until Donna gets re-ended.
 
 P.S.  Can't wait to drink some port in those special glasses!

 It was great to see both of you and drinking Sara's wine is always fun.  
 (Thanks
 again, Sara).   At my soon-to-be-age and with my level of coordination and
 grace, I think it may be more likely that I'll slip, fall or wreck than go on 
 a
 vacation before the "important day."  If I'm lucky, I may even get re-ended
 before then!

 Thanks for letting me share Sara's wine and half of the meal last night.
 After my re-ending experience it was a very welcome evening, indeed. You
 both look great and live interesting lives. I hope we can get together
 for Donna's important day some time around July 12th. I am saving the
 Cakebread reserve for the occasion. Maybe, we will have some more
 interesting vacations, wrecks, or slip and falls to discuss by then.
