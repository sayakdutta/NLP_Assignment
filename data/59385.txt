 That is fine.  We will use what is already set up, PBregion1.

 Kam/Russ:
 
 As per Russ, Felicia created the org. regions in CPR as PBregion, e.g. PBWEST1, PBWEST2, etc.
 The spreadsheets have it as region, e.g. WEST1, WEST2, etc.
 
 Please let us know if you require a change in the CPR regions.
 
 Thanks,
 Jeremy
