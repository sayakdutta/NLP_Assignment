 
 Wanted to say Hello.  I must tell you I miss you, I don't have anyone to 
 shake my head at anymore. Hoping all is well with the new position.  Also 
 wanted to thank you for calling Pam I do appreciate that .  There are  plans 
 are for my husband and I to meet some friends of yours this weekend.  We are 
 getting together with the Schnitzers and they have invited the Kushnicks .  
 Jon and Susan really enjoy them and have wanted to introduce us for some time 
 now.  
 Looking forward to the introduction.    Again,  I hope the job is treating 
 you well.
 
 
 Best Regards,
 Sandra
