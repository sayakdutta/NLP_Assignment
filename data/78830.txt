 Hi Daddy.  It's Allison.  I stayed home today.  My arm still feels about the same today.  It hurts when I get up and feels better when I lay still.  I am taking my medicine.  I will go back to school tomorrow.  I love you.    Allison
  
  
 Hi Dad.  It's Matthew.  I'm doing good today.  I am taking care of Allison today.  See you later.   Matthew
