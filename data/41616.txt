 
 Hi, Robbi!
 
 I've been meaning to call you, but as you can imagine, it's been extremely busy here.  Hope you're okay and I'll try to talk with you soon.  No, we still haven't received anything from Robert Allen to return our fabric.  I was hoping they would send something last week, because we shipped our gifts to Washington and we could have sent it at the same time.  Let me know what you hear from them.
 
 Let's try to get together after the 1st.  I know it's going to be too busy this week and next, so why don't we shoot for after the new year.
 
 If I don't talk to you soon have a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
 
 Marie
 
  
     
 
 Marie,
  
   Did they ever pick up your material?   If not, let me know and I will call them again.
  
   Hope all is well with you.  Let's get  together soon!
