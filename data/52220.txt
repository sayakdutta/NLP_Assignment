 I am glad I did not fail you completely.
 As you know by now, we have hit 
 some turbulence and I had to stay in
 Houston.

 Thanks for sending Dr Lu -- Zimin did a great job and it immeasureably enhanced the credibility of the panel to have someone of his talent attending. 
 I am eager as ever to find a way of learning how you guys do it!
