 
 Thanks for the attached deal information, Shouan.  Looking at the data I feel 
 confident that, once we are past the first day of the month, the gas daily 
 options curveshift is valuing correctly.  However, I am still concerned with 
 the valuation from 10/31.  Is there anyway to see same breakdown on 11/2 and 
 11/3 for 10/31's position.  If you could send me that information in the same 
 format I think we may have an answer for the changed deal value we saw fall 
 out of my trader's book on 11/1.
