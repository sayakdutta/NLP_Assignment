 Has this been signed and sent to Microsoft?

 Corinna -
 
 I have looked at the attached.  It is fine.  I will be printing two originals 
 for Net Works' signature.  I'll have them sent down for signature so that 
 they can then be sent to Microsoft.

 Mark,
 
 Can you please review the changes made by Susan Chang at Microsoft to the SQL 
 2000 SP1 JDP MOU for our Unify application.  Bob Ward is out of the office 
 until June 4th, and this application is going into production on June 11th.  
 We need to ensure the MOU is finalized and signed prior to going into 
 production so that we can receive the appropriate support from Microsoft when 
 we go live.
 
 If you need to contact Susan her telephone number is 425-703-6394.  Her email 

 
 Thanks for your immediate attention to this matter,
 Corinna Bolender

 Bob and Corinna,
 Here are the versions of the MOU your lawyer will need to review.  As
 expected, some of the items just did not make the bar to warrant a
 change.  Specifically:
 an actual date for the released product will not go on the MOU.
 Customers who particpate in the JDP have a high degree of touch and
 disclosure with MS.  Although we are glad to discuss dates and they draw
 near with the customer we do not promise anything from the beginning
 (though this hardly matters now considering the date).
 The line in #4 that was cut and pasted to #17 has been placed back in
 #4.  This is due to the placement of the topic in #4.  The rest of #17,
 specifically stating that there is NO COST TO THE CUSTOMER has been left
 in on #17, and I'll probably incorporate this for future use.  It is a
 good addition.
 #10 on Microsoft's section has been removed.  It is clearly rednundant
 and not necessary.  We already say there is absolutely no cost to the
 customer.
 
 If this is agreeable (I have included the red lined version, so your
 lawyers can review), the final version with those changes have also been
 included.  Please print, sign and return.
 
 Thanks!
 JamMo!

 James - per our phone call this afternoon, I've revised the MOU.
 Attached is the redlined version as well as the final doc.  Please let
 me know if you have any questions.

 Susan,
 I would like to permanently modify our MOU to the following for our
 Joint Development Programs.  It is redlined, so you can review the exact
 changes.  This is actually from the customer, but I like what they
 changed and added, I just want to be certain that it's not going to come
 back and bite me later.  Roughly 4 or 5 sentenced.
 Thanks for you help!

 Hi, James.  I've attached a copy of the MOU which contains some minor
 changes suggested by one of our attorneys.  Let me know what you think.
 Thank you.
