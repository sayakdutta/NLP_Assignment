 Tori,
 
 	I just wanted to give you an update.  We hope to be able to start work on building your report early next week.  We are currently looking at two sources of data and
 working with other teams on who can provide us with the best source.  As far as the Canadian prices I did find out we have real-time access to the currency rate so converting
 that to US should not provide any issues either.  I'll be in touch early next week.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Dave

 I sent this message to colin originally and, since he's out, I am forwarding it to you.  I'm not really sure who the appropriate person is.  I also just realized that I forgot to 
 include the attachment on the original message - oops.  Anyway, could you take a look at this sheet and let me know what you could come up with?  
 I'd like to build something that looks like the "price sheet" tab. Thanks.

 This is a spreadsheet that we used to have in our fundies packet a while back.  It is no longer being maintained, but I was wondering if you could cook something up that looks similar to it -- linking to the fundies price database.  Let me know.  Thanks.
