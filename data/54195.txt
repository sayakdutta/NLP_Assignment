 
 Clayton,
 
 We can offer the seminar / discussion session on Monday, December 18,
 at 3:30. Please, let me know if this would work.

 Vince-
 
 George is fully enthusiastic for a seminar by Research on these ideas and 
 resource tools. Any afternoon is fine to him- we can probably push the time 
 up to 3:00 or so so everyone who needs to cheat to get away from work early 
 to go shopping can.
