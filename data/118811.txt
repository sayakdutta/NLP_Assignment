 
 I believe that this is not the GTC but rather the master agreement used for 
 bandwidth.  I spoke with Cynthia Harkness, one of the bandwidth lawyers, last 
 week.  My impression was that the bandwidth trading documentation was still 
 in flux and they were waiting for it to settle down before preparing a GTC.

 Mark,
 
 Attached is a copy of the OTC GTC which the Bandwidth group wishes to use for 
 Bandwidth trading on EnronOnline, launching May 1.
 
 Could you please let me know which of your guys will be looking after 
 reviewing/amending this for EnronOnline?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Dave

 David,
 
 Here's a first cut of the data to get us started.  Please have a look, and 
 let me know what other blanks we will need to fill in as we go.  I've also 
 looked at the additional considerations, and we should sit down and discuss 
 some of these things with Jean sometime soon.
 
 Please review the attached documents, and I'll continue to refine them along 
 the way.  Let me know if you have any questions.
 
 Thanks for your help,
 Jay
