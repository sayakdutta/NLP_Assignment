 
 Thanks for the update
 
  
     
 Colin asked me to cover our current development on security.
 
 I met with the Web Requests team yesterday and we found that our model was correct however there was an bug in the software.
 We have worked through that and will do some further testing today.  If all goes well I anticipate we can define the users in the group
 and implement secure links next week.
