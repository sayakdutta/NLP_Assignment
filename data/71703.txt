 Actually, we are in the process of faxing you the information on the three 
 companies.  Also, we would like to delete the first sentence of Section 5.  
 We do not, in the ordinary course of business keep tracking records of all of 
 the confidential information that we receive.  It will be maintained in our 
 project files and will be available to be returned, but we do not keep 
 separate records.  Thanks for your consideration.
 Regards,
 Bill
