 The insanity continues.  I finally called Lee Johnson at S&S, who fortunately 
 had called me, and asked him if he knew if Kent was around, as I hadn't heard 
 from him.  He is going to get in touch with Kent for me.
 
 I'm expediting Paul Pipitone re the ABB facility agreement, but haven't heard 
 back from him yet.
 
 Hope your trip is going well.

 Yes please.  I do not know of a single project LLC that is ready to commit to 
 Phase II Turbo Park.  So I suggest we send them corporate docs from 
 Pleasanton Local Reliability  Facility LLC and tell them that all of our 
 LLC's are basically the same.
