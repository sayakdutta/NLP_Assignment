Our ENW CAO had summarized the data for us into the single page format, and he had never e-mailed me the file.  He was gone for the day, and I tried his cell phone, but didn't get an anwer.  
 
 Let me know how the meeting with Beth and Evan went today.  Lavorato and I have been working on something regarding gas logistics, and a follow up meeting was called on that this morning at 10:30.  The outcome of the meeting required a visit with David Oxley, so I could tell that making a meeting with you at 11:00 probably wasn't going to happen.  
 
 How are your 5:00 pm meetings?  
 
 I will catch up tomorrow.  --Sally 
 
 
 Hope that you made it to the soccer play-off game tonight!!
