 specifically what requires an exception?  I am the signoff for the wholesale 
 group, but it makes sense to be consistent across Enron.
 
 Regards,
 
 Mark

 Mark - Would you please approve this for Rex?
 
  
     
 Sharon - Exceptions are handled through an approval from Mark Haedicke. If he 
 approves the exception, then we will not subject the mail file in question to 
 the retention agent. Please let me know if I can be of further assistance.
 
 Thanks-

 I am requesting that Rex Rogers, Vice President and Associate General 
 Counsel, of our Enron Corp. Legal Department be granted an exception to the 
 length of time that he can retain his messages.  He has some emails from 1999 
 that are important for him to retain because they deal with Securities and 
 Exchange Commission filings, the Enron Corp. Form 10-K, and other vital 
 information.  Thank you for your consideration.
