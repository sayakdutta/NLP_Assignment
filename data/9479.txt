 Sally,
 
 This includes most of the suggestions Andy made (all the word/format relate=
 d=20
 ones, at least).  The only one I have not made relates to our discussion=20
 about adding a slide that outlines the history behind the Operations Pricin=
 g=20
 Desk and the various factors considered in building it.  Please let me know=
 =20
 if you=01,re busy and want me to glean the information from the slides you =
 have=20
 archived.
 
 Lets talk about it in more detail tomorrow.  If you need me at anytime,=20
