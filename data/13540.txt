 Michelle,
 
 I certainly have the training and informational materials and can enlist Roy 
 and Derek (technical side of the team) to run the reports.  I know Kathryn 
 McLean has been providing overall statistical reports to Cindy Olson, so 
 these probably already exist and are being finalized for the VP/MD meeting 
 7/31 and 8/1.
 
 Let me know when you want me to provide these materials.
 
 Thanks,
 Jennifer
