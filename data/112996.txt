 RE: EPSA Draft Comments on NYISO and Con Ed Requests to
       Extend AMP and LMM
       ? Filings Due on Friday, October 19th
 
 The New York Independent System Operator, Inc. (NYISO) and Con Ed have again made requests to extend both the Automated Mitigation Procedures (AMP) and the revised localized market-power mitigation measures  (LMM) until October 31, 2002.  Once again, EPSA has drafted a protest, arguing that the use of price correction mechanisms result in unintended, yet harmful, consequences on the market such as limiting market entry, slowing the development of risk mitigation tools, and undermining demand-side response.  EPSA's also stresses that yet another extension of the provisions, intended to address flaws in the start-up of the market two years ago, is unwarranted.
