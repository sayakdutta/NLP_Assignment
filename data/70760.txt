     Attached please find a clean and blackline of the latest draft of
 the Enron South America Break-Out Agreement.  The only changes made to
 this version is the addition of today's date and the 72/25 split of
 Change Order 3 in Section 6.2.  We are still missing the Agreement
 Reference in section 6.7.1.  We haven't made any changes to the exhibits
 since the last time they were circulated.  I will pull them out of our
 Houston database and circulate them shortly.
