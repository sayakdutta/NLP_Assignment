 	As a valued member of the RFF Council, we thought you might
 appreciate knowing that Resources for the Future President Paul Portney
 has been asked to appear on C-SPAN's "Washington Journal" this Wednesday
 (August 15th) between 8am and 9am for a live, hour-long interview.
 
 	It is a unique and unprecedented opportunity to enlighten a
 national television audience about RFF itself - its mission, research,
 history and future goals, much of which you have helped to support.
 
 	C-SPAN's request for the interview followed intense media
 coverage of Dr. Portney's work chairing the National Academy of Sciences
 committee on fuel economy standards, and Katherine Probst's
 widely-reported study on the future costs of Superfund.
 
 	You can also access the interview online at www.c-span.org and
 click on the live TV/radio programs icon at the top of the page.
 
 	Thank you.
 
 	Russell M. Ray
 	Assistant Director, Development
 	Resources for the Future
