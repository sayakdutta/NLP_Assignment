 
 All, 
 
 After filling out and gathering all the feedback forms in the last couple of 
 weeks, Jeff and I just realized that we forgot to ask everyone for an 
 accomplishment list from each of you.  We have had a very successful 2001 so 
 far and we need to be able to discuss each group and your personal mid-year 
 in detail.  Please send us an email with your accomplishments so that we have 
 all the facts during the PRC process.  
 
 This doesn't need to be formal but simply put together and email to both of 
 us for the appropriate time.
 
 Thanks,
 Mike and Jeff
