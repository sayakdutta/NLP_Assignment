 Jeff,
 
 I went to talk to Steve Horn this morning and he seemed happy with the idea 
 of me going over to HTC. I will now work on settling a date for me to 
 transfer. I am very happy about this experience and want to express my 
 gratitude for all your help and suggestions. I will definitely let you know 
 how it is once I move over there.
 
 Again, thank you.
 
 Massimo
