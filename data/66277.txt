                   i was just kidding.  i am very sweet.  i feel terrible
    that
       you
                didn't
                   sleep
                   well. if there was anything i could do to make you feel
       better
          i
                would.

                      of course you don't.  you just dream up these things
    so i
          will
                feel
                      sorry
                      for you, i don't.  you slept fine.

                         that's your fault.  you were taking up over half of
       the
          bed,
             i
                had
                   to
                         ask
                         you to move over.  and then you kept coughing in
    the
          middle
             of
                the
                      night
                         and
                         waking me up. so, i did not sleep well. you
    probably
          slept
                better
                      than
                         me, i
                         don't know what you're complaining about.
 
                         

                                                                            
 
                         i am tired b/c i kept waking up with no covers and
    my
          butt
             was
                      hanging
                         off
                         the bed. i looked at you and you were covered up to
       your
             neck
                with
                      the
                         covers in the middle of the bed.  you look like you
       slept
             well.
