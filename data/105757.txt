 Slight amendment to your proposal:
 
 (1) Credit Tuesday 27th at 10 am
 (2) Softs Tuesday 27th at 11 am
 
 Already have a meeting scheduled at 9am that day. Will this work for you ?
 Thanks
 Janine
 
 
 

 
  
 Janine:  I would like to meet with you (and Guenther) regarding two topics:
 
 (1)  softs trading (together with Bob Bruce)
 
 (2)  credit trading (do we need anyone else?)
 
 Either of Tuesday or Friday morning works fine.  Let me propose 9 am Tuesday 
 for softs and 10 am for credit (and I am flexible).  Bob and I are located 
 only several offices apart on the 38th floor of the Enron building.
 
 We look forward to hearing from you.
