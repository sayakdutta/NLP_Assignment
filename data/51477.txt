 Hi Shirley,
 I would like to request for a new PC.  My current PC is quite old with not 
 enough memory.  Twice 
 I ran out of memory and had to have IT people coming to clean it for me. 
 Their suggestion is
 to either get a new hard drive or a new PC.  Given that Dell has Pentiumc III 
 Processor at 800 MHz
 on market, I would like to request a PC with process at 500 MHz or higher 
 level. 
 Thank you very much.
 
 Best,
 Alex
