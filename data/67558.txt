 
 Can you set up a mid for all deals at a location of NBPL/Peoples and 
 PGLC/NBPL.  The intramonth curve Chi./N/Border and the gas daily curve is 
 GDC-Chi./N/Bord.  Can you tell me how many deals are currently in the system 
 for these two locations.  Sorry to rush you, but I need these in for calcing 
 tonight.  Thanks.
