 
 schweiger's been preparing for that mtg since wednesday.  how do you think lay/whalley did?
 
  
     
 I wanted to see how they would handle themselves - glad i did.  I guess Schweig did all the yelling for everyone....
 
  
     
 do you want to go to learn what happened or do you want to go yell at those guys/see those guys get yelled at?
