 
 In addition, to learning about the $0.15 default allowance for buyback 
 volumes, I have also discovered that we need to deduct another $0.15 to $0.18 
 per MMBtu to cover firm transportation costs that we incur as a result of 
 this transaction.  The cost will vary depending on the fuel costs.  The 
 transport cost is made up of $0.0103 commodity fee, $0.07 demand fee and fuel 
 of 1%.
 
 Please provide some direction on this, as I will need to adjust the pricing 
 in sitara, but would like to make sure that I'm performing the correct 
 procedure.
 
 Thanks for your help.
 
 P.S. I do agree with your last e-mail .
