 Curry some idea of when the ISDA can be sent?  Thanks.

 Now that you have received the credit worksheet from Paul, what is the 
 status/timeline of getting an ISDA agreement I can forward to the customer?  
 Thanks for your assistance with this, - Mike

 Sara-- Are you still the swaps lawyer to assist with this?  If not, would you 
 pass it to the person who can help Mike Curry with this?  Thanks.
