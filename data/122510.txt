 
 I didn't know you were going to Florida in July.  I will look at my schedule.  Do we know anyone in Miami?  ILY, K.
 
 
     
 
 Hey, did we decide whether you were going to Florida with me in July?  The
 meeting starts for me on Sunday, 7/14 and runs through Wednesday morning the
 17th.
 
 If you're interested, we could fly up on Thursday or Friday before and you
 could fly out on Sunday the 14th.
 
 This is apparently very close to Miami, so there may be someone we know that
 we could visit.  I'm sending you a map via your hotmail account.
 
 See if your job situation will permit you to go with me!
