 I'm on the phone with Donna and due to our extremely busy schedules we have 
 penciled in May 16 as D-Day (you know, "dinner date").  After the Enron legal 
 conference, I'm on vacation which is the reason for the May date.  Before the 
 Enron legal conference, Donna is out of town most of the time.  So - please 
 let us hear from you.
 
 Did you remember Monty's birthday?

 Sara and Donna:
 
 I apologize for waiting two months to pick a date in order to consume
 some of Sara's excess wine, but I think I found a good place to meet.
 There is a restaurant named La Vista at 1936 Fountain View, just North
 of the Rice Epicurean. It should be real close to Donna, and they let
 you bring your own bottle(s) of wine. If Sara brings the wine, then I
 could spring for the dinner and Donna could bring the flowers.
 
 I am tied up next Thursday and Friday, and I know that Sara has the
 Enron Law Conference in San Antonio the following Wednesday, Thursday
 and Friday. Hopefully, there is a window in there when we can all get
 together.
