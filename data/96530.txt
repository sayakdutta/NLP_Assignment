 Elizabeth,
 
 Three documents are coming your way by three routes:  1. the draft 
 definitions for our confirms is attached.  2. the agenda for the WSPP 
 meeting  is easy to get off the internet:  Brenda can put in "WSPP.com" into 
 the search engine and pull up the WSPP homepage on which is listed the agenda 
 for the meeting which can be printed out.  3. Jan is sending a monster fax of 
 the latest proposed changes to the agreement.   
 
 When you have all this paper, let's talk.--cgy
