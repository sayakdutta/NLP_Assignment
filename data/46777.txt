 
 Per our earlier agreements with the Online Team, this counterparty is a 
 division and I will not open them up to trade until the incorporated entity 
 is part of the counterparty name.  Our financial contract is set up as "Koch 
 Industries, Inc., acting through its Koch Hydrocarbon Company Division".
