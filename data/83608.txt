 I am glad to hear from you.  Yes, Sao Paulo is muy grande con muchos 
 macacos.  Everything is going fine here.  Do you have any trips to the US 
 planned?  I have not be playing much golf, too cold and rainy here so far 
 this winter, but spring is near.
 
 Stay in touch and good luck.

 Hey, just wanted to say hi to you. 
 I moved to SP 10 days ago. Very exiting city, don't you think so? Not many 
 places to play golf here, but I will have to look better. Are you playing??
 How are things going there? How is your desk doing this year? Things are 
 difficult in the region - I believe you are aware of it - but as usual, we 
 are trying hard.
 
 Well, just wanted to let you know thta I am in SP now, working for Remi 
 Collonges.
 
 Lets keep in touch.
 
 Rolo
