 Kevin,
 
 Don has asked me to provide you with some sort of valuation matrix based on your request of the other day.  I have spent some time with Stacey White, Jody Pierce and Georgeanne Hodges in an effort to better understand how New Albany is being valued/treated for accounting purposes.  When you have a free moment, could you spend a few minutes with me to give me a better idea of what you would like to see.  Thanks

 As an aside, we heard from CLECO on New Albany.  They gave us a bid range of $98MM- $122MM without any suggestion that they would insist upon a toll for this summer.
