 Please have my phone forwarded to Ava and provide her with my contact information.

 Shelley, I need to make my vacation plans for the Christmas holidays and I don't know how long you will be away.
 
 Since I did not take any vacation during Thanksgiving, I was planning on leaving Thursday December 20th, returning on Monday January 7th.  Jean will be checking my lap top to make sure my dial-in access is stable so I will be able to keep your in basket clean.  During these dates, I could also have your phone forwarded to Ava if you wish.  We can work out the details later, but I need to purchase my ticket today.  
 
 Since there are many things going on during these uncertain times and you need me here, please feel free to say so,,,, I understand completely.
 
 Thank you, Ricki
