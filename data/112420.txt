 And so he gets!!
  
 --Independent RTOs are necessary now in order to provide comparable, non-discriminatory service to all customers 
 --All uses of the transmission grid should be under the RTO tariff
 --RTOs should be of sufficient scope to provide efficiencies and follow the natural traded markets
 --The RTO should operate real time energy markets that include demand side bidding to promote efficiency
 
 
     
 
 In preparation of NARUC, Jim wants us to handout the Bare Essentials from EPSA and the Well-Designed RTO documents.  He also wants a one-page/4 bullet-point list of message points that EVERYONE should convey while at NARUC.  
  
 Would you mind drafting up those 4 key points?  You can just send me an email and I will format and send everything out to everyone this afternoon.  
  
 Thanks!!
