    Jim,
    Julie wants to hold a conference call on Tuesday, October 30th to
    discuss the possibility of designing and undertaking cost-benefit
    analyses to support FERC's RTO policies.  She wants to have you on the
    call & would like to know when you would be available.  Anytime after
    1:00 p.m. EST would probably be best for her.  If you could let me know
    ASAP I will be able to send out an email to those she thinks should be
    on the call.  Thanks, Jim.
