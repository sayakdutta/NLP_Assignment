 It's hard to articulate, so I'll just say that you're doing a phenomenal job.  Whatever happens, you have an incredible amount to proud of, not the least of which is how you've handled things during these very tough times.  Please remember that there's alot of folks out there that appreciate what you're doing and care about you alot.  And then there's your family, which is the most important thing.  Thanks again for your efforts.  Talk to you soon.  Keep hanging in there.
 
 Best,
