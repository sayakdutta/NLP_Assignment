 familiar with CIESA (I am not!).  I don't know anything about a prior 
 interest rate swap.  By copy of this e-mail I am asking Pat Cini to suggest 
 how we might proceed.  If you have further information, please let us know.  
 Thanks.  Sara

 Sara,
 
 Bruce Harris gave me you name as a contact for getting a copy of Enron's 
 approved ISDA documentation.  I am looking a helping our 50% owned 
 subsidiary, CIESA do an interest rate swap to fix rates on its $220MM 
 floating rate note agreement.  The existing swap which was done in 1997 runs 
 off on 10/22/99.  The tax department here at Enron (South America) have asked 
 me to let them review any swap documentation we plan on entering into 
 beforehand so they can look at any tax issues (i.e., tax law changes that may 
 have occured since the last swap was done).  
 
 I am not sure what documentation was used the last time around - I have asked 
 the financial folks at TGS which manages the CIESA FRN on behalf of Enron and 
 Perez Companc to send me a copy of whatever documentation was used before as 
 a starting place but haven't heard back from them.  Do you happen to have any 
 information on the previous swap?
 
 I am on my way to Dallas for the day.  I will give you a call tomorrow to 
 check in.  Thanks.
 
 BRS
