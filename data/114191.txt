 I would like to invite you to a meeting with Jeff Shankman on Tuesday
 January 16, 3:30 p.m.  at Jeff Shankman's office.
 
 We are meeting to plan the agenda for the Tiger Team, a group of about 20 
 Wharton School
 students visiting Enron.  A Wharton  tiger team works through a semester on a 
 special project, proposed by
 a corporation. The team sponsored by Enron works on project regarding the 
 impact of
 electronic trading on the energy markets. The semester long project will  
 result in a report that
 will be submitted to Enron for review and evaluation. I hope that  you will 
 find this report useful.
 
  We have invited our tiger team to visit Enron. The students will arrive on 
 Thursday, 
 January 18, and will spend Friday at Enron. I would appreciate if you could 
 find 30 minutes
 on Friday to talk to the students.
 
 The meeting with Jeff on Tuesday  should not last longer than 10-15 minutes.
 
 Vince
