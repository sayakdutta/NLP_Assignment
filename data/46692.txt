 Susan Vrazel has left the building : )  Actually, Susan has decided to pursue 
 other avenues; her last day was 
 Tuesday, 5/18/99. Global CounterParty (GCP) requests will be handled by 
 Marilyn Colbert, Jason Moore, or myself,
  Samuel Schott. Feel free to contact me with any of your GCP needs, x3-9890. 
 Have a wonderful and productive day.

 So you'll be doing name changes/mergers in the future, not Susan?
