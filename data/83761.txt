 It's that time again for the monthly and quarterly volumetric explanations!  
 The database for September is now ready for viewing.  Just as a reminder, 
 this is the shortcut on your desktop called "Statistical Database". 
 
 As there is continued investor focus on our Wholesale Operations, Investor 
 Relations requests that Business Analysis & Reporting provide monthly 
 volumetric analysis for Wholesale Operations in addition to the quarterly 
 analysis.  Please review the analysis for September 2000 and provide 
 explanations for all material changes (+/- 10%) for the year/year, 
 quarter/quarter, and month/month variances.  The current objective of 
 Investor Relations is to use this analysis as a resource to answer potential 
 investor or analyst questions, but it may be used for ad hoc requests and 
 presentations.   It is essential that the volumes be verified by commercial 
 personnel.
 
 Please forward your verification and explanations via e-mail to me by 3:00pm 
 Tuesday, October 10th.  Please feel free to call with any questions.
 
 Thanks,
