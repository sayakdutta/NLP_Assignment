 
 I was told you may be the person to help me.   I am a trader on the East gas 
 desk working for Scott Neal.  When I was originally set up to operate on EOL  
 I  was set up with many more products than I needed.  I am having problems 
 with my system being very slow and the suggestion was made to delete 
 everything from All Products in stack manager but US Gas.  Are you the person 
 who can help me accomplish this?  All other attempts to speed up the editing 
 process have been unsuccessful.  Even if this does not help improve the time 
 it takes to change a price I would still like to delete these product options 
 because it takes me to long to find my products each day. 
 
 
 
                                                                               
                                                                               
                Thank You!
