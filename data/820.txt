 I'm getting all the details on the 4 options I have with the project:
 Terminate
 Postpone until Q1
 Postpone until deal Closure
 continue as planned.
 
 When I get this info I'll talk with you about it. We're currently about to end Phase 2 (approx 50% completed).

 Have you considered reducing the scope or terminating the Accenture project to conserve cash?  Where are we in terms of %complete?
