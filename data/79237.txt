      Eric Thode's comment reported by Dow Jones yesterday that "most of Enron's critical employees are under contract" is not sitting well with my people--particularly Mary Kay, Rob and Steve.  He also made a comment that bonuses were "scheduled to be paid in mid-February" (a statement on a delicate subject that did not need to be made).  I know that some of this stuff can't be avoided, but I don't think we're even being careful about what is, or is not, said in the media.  I want a fair shot to deliver a solid company with good morale and a high self-esteem to Dynegy.  And mistakes like this don't help morale or the group's cohesiveness. Could you raise the concern at you 11:00 meeting if possible?
