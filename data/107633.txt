 Jeff,
 
 We are reviewing the P+ spread option book.    One item of note is that the 
 correlations used to book the spread options have dropped significantly from 
 what was being used a year ago (see charts below).   I also remember that 
 John Mee was using even higher correlations when he ran this book.  In fact 
 he wanted to book options with a correlation of 1.0, but our model would not 
 allow it, so he was using 0.999.
 
 We are currently calculating historical correlations for you as well.   If 
 you want, Vince and I can review this with you at the end of the day.   Just 
 let me know what time would be convenient.
