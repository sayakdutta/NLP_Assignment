 
 I sent you an earlier email about the blue files.  Now Erica has received 
 back the three hole punch I ordered for you (so you could insert paper into 
 the notebooks I have prepared for you), as well as a request for redweld 
 manila folders (instead of the blue file folders we ordered for you).  Can 
 you work out what supplies you want from us.  We are happy to order whatever 
 you like, but the overseas mail charges are going to increase greatly what 
 the supplies are worth.  Thanks.
