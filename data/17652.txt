 Jeff   Here  goes: 
 Brownouts:    The Major disturbances and  Unusual outages report  of t he   
 US  DOE  EIA  shows 17 incidents  in
 year   2000  but none  for California.  Two  incidents were in   WSCC  -- 
 one  in AZ  a vandalism line outage  and one  1040 MW  transmission  line 
 outage  in New Mexico.   If  I  add  the  5 months outages  reported  to date 
 and annualize them, outages   reported  for the whole  country   total 9570  
 MW  annualized or about   1.1 percent of  the 830 GW  US generation market 
 size.
 
 GDP  and  Hi TECH
 The  US   GDP  is  $8.8 Trillion dollars   and of this  8.2 percent is the  
 high tech industry share. Source: US  Dept of Commerce.      California's  
 GDP  is   $1.2  Trillion  dollars  and of  this,  12 percent  is the high 
 tech industry  share   This  source:   California   Facts, the  Legislative 
 Analysts Office.  Hope  this helps ... Margaret

 On behalf of free-market loving people around the world, thank you.  I'll 
 forward later this morning or early afternoon what I've pulled together (or 
 more accurately, simply re-arranged, using the great info you forward last 
 week).  
 
 Best,
 Jeff
