 Howdy from Houston.  I would really like to discuss.  I've been out the last 
 2 Mondays and missed your calls. I know your were out yesterday.  How about 
 5pm on thursday - Houston time.  Does that work?

 Mike,
 
 There are a number of opportunities that are presenting themselves in Japan 
 that to prove successful will need some close cooperation between our group 
 (also including metals) and global markets.  I am not implying that the 
 relationship is not working, but as I will describe to you these 
 opportunities are very large and I believe that we will need to ensure that a 
 concerted effort is put forward.  I have briefly alluded to some of these 
 with Jeff and with Gary (as he was in Japan last week) and they both seem 
 interested.
 
 Do you have a timeslot tomorrow where I can discuss these with you further?
 
 Joe
