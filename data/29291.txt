 Did Bill Cordes talk to you yesterday about the start date for me to move to 
 his area?  He had mentioned to me about training with Virginia this week and 
 possibly starting next week but that was before he talked with you.  Bill did 
 not mention to Virginia what was decided on this and she just called me to 
 see what I know.  I told her I would talk with you about it as Bill's is out 
 of town for two days.
 
 Thanks...........
