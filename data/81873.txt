 
 just got w/ my source and she told me same thing. it's called luna mora.  sound like a good spot.  if you want to meet up there, I'm game.  let me know what time.
 
  
     
 that might not be the name, but i'm sure its the spot.  it's off of smith and webster.  do you know where that hertz rental and national tire and battery store is, its accross the street.  behind the chevron station.  i'm gonna probably get there around 8:30 or so.
