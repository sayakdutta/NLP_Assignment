 Dear Gerald:
 
 In accordance with our conversation of yesterday regarding the Agreement
 to Upgrade and Operate Natural Gas Pipeline Facilities (the "Upgrade
 Agreement") I have reviewed the documents and investigated the location
 of the metering station; the results are as follows:
 
 * The existing sales contract provides quality and pressure
 obligations.
 * The existing sales contract provides for measurement of the gas.
 * The existing sales contract provides for noncompliance with
 quality obligations.
 * As you indicated, the existing sales contract provides you have
 no obligation to odorize the gas.
 * The existing sales contract provides for the installation of
 meters by Enron.  Part of the metering equipment was replaced under the
 existing sales contract pursuant to an amendment (I will be pleased to
 provide you a copy if you wish).
 * The existing sales contract states that HTI is responsible for
 all taxes except specifically excluded taxes; taxes measured by net
 income are in the list of excluded taxes.
 * The HPL Facilities are on property owned by HTI.  Accordingly,
 company policy dictates that any subcontractor coming on HTI premises
 must carry certain types of insurance that provides for certain
 endorsements.  A sample provision is attached to this message.
 
 On the basis of the meeting held in our offices on Monday with
 representatives of your company, Niels Udengaard, our Vice President,
 was under the impression that the Upgrade Agreement was no longer
 required.  We are prepared to handle the matter in the manner formerly
 used to replace metering equipment.
 
 Please let me have your comments.
 
 Sincerely,
 Haldor Topsoe, Inc.
