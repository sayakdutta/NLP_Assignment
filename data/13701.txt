 Hello Everyone:
  
 As you may know, Community Relations sends the "Tables Report" on a weekly basis. This is a detailed list that includes information about the tables which Enron has purchased to support various non-profits. If an Enron employee has volunteered to fill a table, their name will appear in the far right column. Please share this information with the Executive with which you work, as we would like to utilize every table that we buy. When an Enron employee volunteers to fill a table, we encourage them to leverage it by inviting co-workers, customers, community leaders, etc. 
  
 If you volunteer to fill a table, it is important that you immediately let me know, and I will serve as the liaison with the non-profit organization.
 
 Attached is the updated Community Relations Tables Report.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me directly.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Hilda Bourgeois-Galloway, CPS
