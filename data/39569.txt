 
 The volume and complexity of our legal work has increased dramatically over 
 the past few years.  I think this environment requires additional time to be 
 devoted to legal planning and review in order to provide the best possible 
 service to our clients.  Within the next month, I have asked Janette to 
 schedule a Quarterly Legal Review for each group listed on our new 
 organizational chart .  I  would envision that we would focus on the 
 following:  
 
 review of the current monthly legal report and significant legal issues
 review of the top ten legal risks
 form contracts and other documentation projects
 legal budget
 legal resources, inside and outside
 performance metrics
 
 In addition, I am proposing that any energy trading contract for a term 
 longer than one year by initialled by an AGC or member of the OGC.  Let me 
 know what you think about that.
