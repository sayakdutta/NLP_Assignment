 There has certainly been a lot of  "water over the dam"  since we first discussed your serving as a member of  the MSCF Advisory Board last fall.  Obviously, you were unable to join us  last month in New York, but I never did hear from you or your office whether  your absence was due to a last-minute schedule conflict or whether you no longer  desired to be a part of the Advisory Board.  
  
 Might I hear from you regarding your  interest going forward?  
  
 Rick
