 be Lance and his group.  I will let you know when it gets sorted out.  Mark

 Mark, who within the Enron legal group is responsible for Enron Excelerator?  
 From what I've heard about this initiative, it sounds like it may be doing 
 deals similar to what we've done for Enron in the past.  We'd love to get the 
 opportunity to help -- we have valuable experience we can bring to bear in 
 this area.  Thanks.
