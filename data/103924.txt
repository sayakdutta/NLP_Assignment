 Hydro Quebec has forwarded to us their form of ISDA Schedule for the 
 referenced counterparty for review.  There is no indication of what Enron 
 business person is interested in this counterparty.  I will forward a copy of 
 the ISDA to Mr. "Canada" Suttle, and open a Lotus Notes entry with the 
 contact information.  We won't do anything until we receive a credit 
 worksheet from Credit.
