 
 That all depends on your definition of the word"job." It was actually 
 anticlimactic---Mark told Bob he needed to stick around on some of the old EI 
 litigation, a fact we already knew. Are you at the Sempra deposition. how is 
 it going?

  He keeps saying that he "needs" the $15 million.  Maybe it's a budget thing. 
 I think he really just wants to renegotiate the deal.  I don't think he 
 thinks that IHI has the money to pay us back.  
  What happened at the meeting on Monday with Mark?  Do I still have a job?

 Thanks. I have no idea why Enerson is being so panicky.
