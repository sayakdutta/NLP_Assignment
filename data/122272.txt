 
 Dan,
 
 Thank you for the great card.  I hope all is well with you.  What are you doing now?  Are you still commuting to California?  Are you working for someone in Houston?  ENE is up today to $0.63.  Gosh, it still feels like we've got the decimal point in the wrong place with our stock.  Just heartbreaking.  Oh well, I'm glad 2002 is here.  This will be a better year for all!
 
 Keep in touch!  Happy New Year to you and your family!
 
 Kim.
