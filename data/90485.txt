 
 I understand all of those comparisons, however, the reality is if we lose Dean (which we will if we don't pay 65k + 10k), we will end up hiring a replacement at 75-80k.   This is pretty easy math for me.
 
 I know it seems like a stretch, but the market for hourly traders is very strong right now.   I would like to get this done ASAP.
 
 Thanks.

 I am reviewing the request for an employment agreement renewal on Mark Dean Laurent.  Juan communicated some numbers to me and when reviewing this request would like to ask you to consider the following:
 
 
 Current Salary: $47,500
 Job Group:  Specialist
 YE PRC Rating:  Satisfactory
 
 Original Proposition:
 
 Base Salary 65k
 1 Year Agreement
 $5,000 signing
 
 
 Revised Proposal:
 
 Base Salary:  55k
 1 Year agreement
 $5,000 signing
 Business Case:  If we offered Dean 55k or  60k it would still constitute a over a $10,000 increase (approximately 25%) and taking into consideration he was rated as satisfactory at the specialist level.  Also, the top of the salary range for a specialist is 66k. It would still give him room to progress in the current job group should he not be promoted. Secondly, he will still out price performers that you have in the same job group that are excellent and strong performers respectively eg. Paul Thomas, Jason Choate, Todd DeCook and Peter Makkai.
 
 Salary Listing in Job Group:
 
 Maria Valdes   superior    $62,500
 Paul Thomas   excellent   $55,008
 Jason Choate  excellent   $60,008
 Todd DeCook   strong      $42,008 
 Peter Makkai   strong      $47,500
 
 Let me know your thoughts....then I will run it by Oxley.
