  Florencia - the resolutions which you sent to me by facsimile yesterday are 
 not in the format we use to open brokerage accounts.  We always use the same 
 form to be in compliance with Enron's Risk Management Policy.  I think that 
 Nancy Muchmore will be preparing the resolutions and sending them to 
 Argentina.

 Please let me know so that hopefully we can finish this thing off this week.  
 Next week, I will be in Brazil so maybe I can take this issue of my pending 
 list.

 Dear Rafael,

 brokerage accounts.

 Florencia, we are lacking only one thing to finalize this matter.  We will
 need to modify the corporate resolutions that you prepared.  I have asked
 Susan Flynn (713-853-0975) to work with you on making the appropriate
 modifications to the corporate resolutions.  I left a message at your
 office today and am requesting that you call Susan on Tuesday to make the
 modifications.
 
 Susan, thanks for your help.  Robert, I am proceeding as we discussed.
