 
 I've left a message for Stewart Rosman, the mid-marketer who did this deal, 
 to find out whether or not he wants this confirmed. Diana Scholtes said she 
 thought he did, in which case I need to determine with him what kind of deal 
 this should be, and we'd need to confirm the first leg. I'll let you know as 
 soon as I hear back from him.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
   
  
 There is a leg 2 for this deal that has come up on the list to be confirmed.  
 We did not confirm leg 1 of this deal and I don't think we confirm 
 buy/resales as they are like transmission.  Could check into this and let me 
 know.
 
 Thanks!
