 We are considering several online trading platforms for trading investment 
 grade, high yield and convertible corporate bonds.  
 
 The sites we are considering are as follows:
 
 Market Axess & LIMITrader - I will send you documents for these sites today.
 
 Buy Side Direct, for which documents are being reviewed by your group.
 
 Trading Edge / Bond Link - The review of documents for this site was 
 originally handled by George Weber, who has since forwarded these agreements 
 to Carmen Ayala.
 
 Thanks for your assistance in reviewing these documents.  Please let me know 
 if I can provide additional information during your review.

 In addition to the Buy Side Direct agreement noted below, I am looking at 
 several other online trading sites for corporate bonds.  For assistance in 
 reviewing related agreements, should I work with you ?   
 
 Thanks.

 I recently joined Jeff Kinneman's group and have been asked to participate in 
 the evaluation of various internet trading platforms.  Is your area reviewing 
 agreements / legal issues related to the Buy Side Direct site or its parent 
 Intelligent Markets ?  Could I get an update on the status of this review and 
 any outstanding issues ?
 
 Thanks.
