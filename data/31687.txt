 Hi Everyone-  
 
 Well, as most of you know, I am moving to Florida on Thursday.   I want to 
 have one last happy hour with my Houstonian friends....
 
 Where: The Flying Saucer  (Capital & Main)
 When: Tuesday after work until whenever
 Why: So that I can say Good Bye 
 
 I'll be there as early as anyone else can go.  Call me if you can go over 
 there early with me.  
 I hope to see you there,
 Alicia
