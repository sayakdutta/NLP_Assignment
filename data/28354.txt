 Rather than stating that capacity may be available from November 29, 2000 
 through March 31, 2001, the posting will now state that capacity may be 
 available from November 29, 2000 through March 31, 2001.
 
 For those of you have already sent your approval, please notice this change.  
 For those of you who have not, please forward your approval to me immediately 
 to insure an immediate posting.
 
 As discussed, the posting will remain up today until 6:00 p.m.  Please let me 
 know if there are any further questions.
 
 Thanks
 
 Mike
