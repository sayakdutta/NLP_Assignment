 Susan and John:
 
 Staff would like to reschedule the tentative Tuesday P & Z meeting.
 
 City council members are also set to meet on this date for a elevated
 tower/cell tower workshop.
 
 I had envisioned a 30 minute meeting with P & Z members to finalize the last
 remaining item (driveway distance from right-of-way) at the Tuesday meeting
 before council's workshop.
 
 However, I have since received a letter and sketch from CenterAmerica
 concerning the demolition of Weiner's.  CenterAmerica is proposing a 3 to 4
 story development consisting of retail on the first floor and a self-storage
 facility on the remaining floors.
 
 Staff would like to begin discussion with P & Z on this CenterAmerica
 proposed project.
 
 Would you be available on either Wednesday (February 7) or Thursday
 (February 8) at
 7:00 P.M. for a longer meeting?
