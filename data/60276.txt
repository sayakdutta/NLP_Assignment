 
 No master on EOL.
 
 GTC.
 
  
     
 Louise,
 
 The consensus which emerged from the meeting this morning is that the Power guys would like to have a full blown Master Agreement on EnronOnline instead of a simpler GTC.
 
 Obviously, I can put either onto EnronOnline, but wanted to let you know before we do so.
 
 If you want us to stick with a simple GTC, please let me know.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Dave
