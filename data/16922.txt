 
 FYI.  Note that TURN sez that the Commission should use the enactment date of 
 AB1X as the date that the rate freeze ended.

 Yesterday (the 8th) was the day for parties to file testimony in the Rate
 Stabilization Proceeding.  I have done a quick review of TURN's testimony,
 and they did not submit tables which go back and calculate the impact of
 adopting its proposed accounting changes on transition cost recovery and the
 TRA undercollection balance.  In its testimony, TURN stated that it tried to
 do such a calculation, but that the numerous adjustments which the UDCs had
 made to their regulatory accounts since last summer made the task alot more
 difficult than anticipated.  TURN estimates, however that PG&E's TCBA
 balance as of 12/31/01 would be approximately $5.1 billion, while SCE's
 would be $2.9 billion.  TURN states that they have requested through a data
 request that the UDCs do the tables for them, but that if they do not
 comply, that the commission should direct the UDCs to provide the tables.
 
 Also, TURN has taken the position that the enactment of AB X 1 has
 effectively ended the rate freeze and the date of the enactment of the
 statute  is the one the Commission should pick for purposes of declaring the
 rate freeze over.
 
 I have not gone through other parties testimony yet, but wanted to let you
 know what TURN has done (or not done).
