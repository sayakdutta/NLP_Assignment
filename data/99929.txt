 split stream flows.

 I left a message with Pam Stiegerwald, I'll tell her she should move her gas, otherwise it'll be allocated.

 3,000/day is being schedule at Wolf Creek and we are not receiving volume thus increasing Continental's imbalance.
 
 Should we be allowing this volume to be scheduled?
