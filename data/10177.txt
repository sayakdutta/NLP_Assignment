 I realize the below referenced classes are during PRC.  I have talked with =
 Frazier and here is our game plan for the
 teams.  If you can attend one of the sessions below, please make every effo=
 rt to attend.  If you cannot attend, then let Ava know and she
 will keep track of names for me.  After the PRC process we will set up a vi=
 deo  for you to watch.  It is very critical we
 all attend the meeting or see the video. =20
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks. Lynn
