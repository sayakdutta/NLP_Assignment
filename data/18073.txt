 My apologies.  My schedule melted down after we talked on Monday.  Here's 
 where folks came out.  There's some concern about size.  We're supposed to be 
 no larger than 3, but we lobbied Aceves and he apparently Ok'd our 
 "oversized" group.  The other folks in the group--who talked to him 
 originally--are pretty sure that five will violate the rules.  Folks wondered 
 if there were other groups that are smaller than ours that you could hook up 
 with.  Sorry about that---it's a wrinkle that I didn't think about when we 
 spoke.  If it gets real ugly trying to find a smaller group, let me know.  
 Fortunately there's not another team case due for two weeks.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
