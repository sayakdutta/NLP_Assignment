 Thanks for your e-mail. Here is language I purpose of Article 8.2
 
  8.2. Transfer.  This Agreement, including, without limitation, each
 indemnification, shall inure to and bind the permitted successors and
 assigns of the Parties; provided, neither Party shall transfer this
 Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Party which
 consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or  delayed; Notwithstanding the
 foregoing, either Party may, without the consent of the other Party (and
 without relieving itself from liability hereunder)but upon written notice,
 (i) transfer, sell,
 pledge, encumber or assign this Agreement or the accounts, revenues or
 proceeds hereof in connection with any financing or other financial
 arrangements, (ii) transfer or assign this Agreement to any Affiliate by
 assignment, merger or otherwise, or (iii) transfer or assign this Agreement
 to any person or entity succeeding to all or substantially all of the
 assets of such Party; provided that any such succeeding entity or Affiliate
 meets or exceeds the creditworthiness of the assigning Party and further
 provided that such succeeding entity or Affiliate agrees in writing to be
 bound by the terms and conditions hereof.  Any Party's transfer in
 violation of this Section 8.2 shall be void.
 
 Let me have your thoughts regarding the attached.

    Debra,
    A few corrections made -- corrected spelling of MarkWest, added company
    info for exhibits A & C.
 
    Still missing the language you wanted to add instead of mine in sect.
    8.2,
    subsections (ii) & (iii).  Please see my notes in the document.  Once we
    get the wording agreed upon for these two subsections, we should have an
    agreement.
 
    We'll also need to discuss the GISB, but let's first get the master firm
    agreement in place.  Any questions, please feel free to e-mail me at

    Sara,
 
    Attached I hope,  is the correct redline version which exemplifies  the
    agreed to changes.  Please review and let me know if there are any
    additional corrections.
