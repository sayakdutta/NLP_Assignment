 Carol - While it never too late to suggest a change, given the political 
 situation I would be hesitant to offer anything more than a "clarification".  
 While I would not spend a huge amount of time on it, I suggest you examine if 
 there are any changes. Depending on what happens in the Senate (now that it 
 is in Democratic hands), the process can be reopened and we could have an 
 opportunity to offer suggested changes (or it kill the bill all together).

 Chris:
 Would it be too late to suggest changes to the definition of "forward 
 contracts" in the Bankruptcy Code in order to improve our position with 
 respect to the physical supply contracts that EES enters into?  I am not sure 
 what chnages we would want, but was wondering if there was any opportunity to 
 suggest a change.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.
