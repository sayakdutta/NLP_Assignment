 
 I am not a market maker in SWA vouchers, so you have my word that I will not 
 sell them back.  Your bid for these vouchers is $250 in the market, my bid 
 for bulk is $200,  I am willing to pay more.  I can already get to my 
 destination for $250 - so maybe we can meet in the middle.
 
 Let me know
 
 
 
 

    
 
 If you get me for $200--you can sell em to me for $250.
 I have no offer for you.
 Thanks
 David

 Well I am looking for 24 Round trip tickets (48 one-ways)  and was looking
 to spend around $200 per round trip ($100 for each one-way).  What is your
 offer on that size?
 
 Thanks for you PROMPT attention because I am trying to book airfare today
 on one airline or another.

 Let's put it like this: How many do you want and at what price are you
 willing to pay?
