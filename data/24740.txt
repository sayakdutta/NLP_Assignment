 Ian,
 
 Forget that last message. Apparently my e-mail just updated.

 Hi Chris,
 
 I think this is what you were wanting.  The spread graphs can be found in the "spread charts" worksheet.  The data for the charts can be found in the "spread << File: Spreads Data.xls >>  data" tab.
 
 Regards,
 Ian
