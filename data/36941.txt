 If you need a place to stay, you are more than welcome to stay with us. We moved to Flower Mound, but it is still pretty good access to Texas Stadium.

 Good.  The game is in Irving, so I will try to find a hotel around there.
 It is also at 7:00pm.  We will get into town early so we can come by and
 see you guys.  You moved to a new house, right?  I'll keep you posted.
