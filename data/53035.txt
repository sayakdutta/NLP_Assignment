 I should finish the review in a day or two. 
 We were quite busy here in Enron for the last few days.

 Dear Dr. Kaminski,
 
 I would appreciate if you could let me know if you have completed to review
 the article entitled: "Let's Swing Again (Pricing Non-Storable Commodity
 Options" by Grimwood and Hodges.
 
 I have recently received a call from one of the authors and I promised him
 that I would have sent them the report as soon as possible. Please let me
 know.
 
 Thank you very much for your time and understanding.
 
 Best regards,
 
 Paolo
