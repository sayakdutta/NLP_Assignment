 We need to get an invoice from the travel agency Heather and Ozzie used for 
 my flights last week.  I know the travel agent's name is Julie, but I don't 
 know the details.  The agency is something like Vitol.  I suspect Claudette 
 can give you the telephone number, etc.  I would have gotten a receipt from 
 Continental, but the E ticket machine wasn't working.
 
 I have the rest of the receipts.
