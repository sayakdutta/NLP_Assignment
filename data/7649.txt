 
 Congratulations on your added role of CEO for Enron Europe.  I look forward 
 to continuing to work with you and the staff in London on risk management 
 operations initiatives.  
 
 I talk with Brent Price several times a week.  I know that Fernley has 
 appreciated his participation in London, and I hope that you have found his 
 involvement to be beneficial as well.  We are almost at the half way mark on 
 his assignment, so I will talk with you next week when I return from Calgary 
 to get your input on his role to date.
