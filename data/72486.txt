 
 Well, you know how casual lenders are about commitment letters...
 
 

  
  
 Barry Welch left me a voice mail indicating that the commitment letters will 
 be re-issued without the "credit committee out".  The language was left-in 
 "by mistake".  I'll let you know when I receive the corrected letters.
