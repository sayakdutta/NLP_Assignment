 
 Yeah that party sounds fun, count me in.  Where do you live and what night is this IPAMS reception?
 
 
     
 
 
 -- Yeah, its the same gal.  She is alot of fun, even though she does 
 bad things!!  All of her friends are fun too, so it should be a good 
 time. Canadians always put on fun parties  I think she invited Russ 
 Moran too.  Give me a call if you would like to go and maybe we can 
 just meet at my house and go from here since it is right up the 
 block.  Are you going to be at the IPAMS reception tomorrow night?
 Talk to you soon
