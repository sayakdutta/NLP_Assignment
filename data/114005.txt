 Please set up a new login for Jason Kaniss for EOL stack manager.  He will be trading US East Power and US NorthAmerican Gas.  Jason works for me on the East Power MidWest desk and will be training under me for the rest of this year.  All transactions under this login should go into EPMI MidWest risk book.  If you have any qestions, please call me at x 3-9684.  Thanks,
 
 Fletcher Sturm
 
 p.s.  I'd like him to be able to login tomorrow a.m. if possible.
