 
 No skiing yet.  Unfortunately, my trips are in limbo.  I'm pretty sure I'm 
 going to South Padre island in two weeks, but the skiing might wait until 
 March, except that I'm going to NY for the Big East Championship Game and my 
 brother's coming down here for a week to hang out.  Oh well, I need the 
 vacations...
 
 
 
 
 
 

   
  
 
 No word yet-
 Raul and John Batten are here today trying to sell our services to the new
 administration - so we should hopefully know soon...  Did you go skiing?
 
 
 
     
 
 
 What's up?  Any news on Pirnie/AFI contract negotiations?
