 Agghh!
 
 Tried to protest the move, saying that I couldn't make it to the Tuesday
 meeting, so she switched me to yet another team - which I will not mention -
 that couldn't have been worse if I had hand picked it.  So I told her that a
 phone call came in that confirmed I could change my plans and I am back to
 the second team - with Courtney, Kimberley, and Anil Sama.  It's a good
 team, though not as good as my first!  :)
 
 Oh, well!
 
 
 
 
     
 
 
 I've got an idea.  Howzabout Ted cooks and you clean up?  Seriously,
 though, I'll try to host next time at my humble apartment.

 No problemo!  Maybe I will cook for us next time...oh, that's right I don't
 cook anymore...
 
 I thought we did a good job of cranking things out.  Have a good weekend!
 
 
     
 
 
 thanks again for hosting.  most kind of you, and we seemed to make a lot of
 progress.  did you get enough money for dinner?
