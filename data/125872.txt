 I don't have any immediate needs.  I don't know if anyone would want to come work for Canadian Pesos anyway.
 
 Sorry I couldn't be more help.
 
 See you
 
  
     
 John, 
 
 Do you have any positions to fill?  There are a couple Directors down to Sr. Specialists from EBS who might be looking for positions.  I'd only recommend good people who have found themselves in difficult positions.
 
 How about that Skilling announcement?
 
 Let me know bubba.
