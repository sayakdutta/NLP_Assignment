 
 Neil left to go hunting this am, Paige leaves for school tomorrow, leaving 
 me, Michael and our new puppy (mid life crisis dog) to our own devices.  I'm 
 taking the day off tomorrow, and Monday is an Enron holiday, so I'm looking 
 forward to some Kay time, working in the yard (weather permitting), watching 
 Oprah, etc.  
 
 
 
 
 
 

   
  
 Boys............whatcha gonna do?
 They love that stuff.........
 Missy, our friend Susie, and I went to the usual Elvis
 impersonator thing at Chuy's on Richmond Monday night.
 Walked into a full force cat fight on the way in...one
 girl screaming Lesbian at the top of her lungs, and
 dropping the "C" bomb all over the girl she was
 beating up. Waiters had to get them out of the place
 and into the parking lot.  Very exciting. 
 Dinner with family and Dad's widowed friend Claude,
 and his daughter Lisa who we have known forever.  Good
 folks.
 Any plans for you?
