 
 Please note an addition to the daily EOL summary. Two new tables delineate 
 each desk's year-to-date trades, in addition to the month-to-date and daily 
 trade tables usually included in the report. Feel free to let me know if you 
 find this data helpful, harmful, or not even worthy of note.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate
