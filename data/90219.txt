 
 I will do Carson and Juan.   I am having Juan do all of his SE hourly group.   With respect to Forney, I will either do myself or have Doug do it.

 Kevin -
  
 I have prepared the following reviews for mid year:
 Zurita
 Decker
 Wagner
 Makkai
 Ochsner
  
 The following are still outstanding:
 Acevedo, Rudy
 Carson, Mike
 Forney, John
 Garcia, Miguel
 Laurent, Mark Dean
 Hernandez, Juan
  
 As for Rudy, Dean and Miguel, I think Juan and Lloyd/Kayne are in the best situation to at least provide comments on these individuals.  I will be glad to prepare and have no problem doing so by the end of the week.  If you agree, we can forward to Juan and I will coordinate.
  
 Re: Carson and Forney, Juan Hernandez - what do you suggest on these?  I can go either way with these - let me know.  I can easily do them, I just need some mid-year facts and recent obeservations.
