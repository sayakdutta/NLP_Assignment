 
 David,
 
 Please change the date on the draft so that we won't confuse it with the 
 prior drafts.
 
 I would delete "specifically" from 2.10 (c), and add "or later ratify such 
 transaction" (or something to that effect), just in case they later learn and 
 accept the transaction.  
 
 In 2.10 (x), add to "due to an inability to pay, or other credit reason".  In 
 (y), add "or a contractual defense to payment" [could be force majeure, etc]
 
 Again in 2.10, third sentence from the end "any interest, penalties, 
 attorneys fees and court costspayable by the Hub Shipper...;
 
 3.3  Delete "prior" before "approval", and add "or ratification" in the 
 redlined section on refunds.
 
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
