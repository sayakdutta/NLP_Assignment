 The big money making floor?   I don't think I like that.  Too much 
 pressure...what happens if we screw up?
 
 I went to the website and clicked on the link but all I got was a mess of 
 characteres and symbols.  Any ideas how I fix it?

 Hey John,
 
 Did you check out the new spots?!!!  They are posted on the Intranet 
 (home.enron.com).  Let me know what you think!  Hope all is well down there 
 on the 'big money making' floor.
 
 Have a good one, Margaret
