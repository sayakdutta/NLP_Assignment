 This is a Russian built Antonov-12   (Russian equiv.of the C-130 Herc).  I brought it in this afternoon, put 12 tons of pipe on it for Barcelona, Venz. You might recognize David Howser in a cpl of them.
 BRgds,
 Dad

 Here are some pictures of the Kvaerner charter. The plane was a Antonov 12. 
 Also, Ron Porter wanted me to thank you for the Rockets game.
 Thanks,
