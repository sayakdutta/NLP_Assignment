 Kathleen,
 
 I have spoken with Mr. Greene's attorney - Ed Legner - and let him know that 
 his minor suggested changes for the one year extension of the Pontiac site 
 option were acceptable.  I indicated that we would send out originals for 
 review and execution this week.
 
 The procedure we agreed to was as follows:
 
 We will send originals to Ed Legner in Pontiac for his review and initials.
 He will forward to Dick Greene in Florida for execution.
 Dick will sign and send to us
 We execute and return their original along with the the two checks in the 
 amount of $5000 each - one for exercise of the six month extension, and the 
 other for making our requested changes for turbopark compliance and for 
 granting an additional 12 month extension option at the end of this year.
 
 I would like to get this inked as soon as possible in order to ensure the 
 viability of the Pontiac site for a 2003 COD.
