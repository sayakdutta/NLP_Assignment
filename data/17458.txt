 are in the reader.  they ain't.  if anyone has them and could fax them to me 
 at 415.782.7854, would be greatly appreciated.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
 
 Also, I like both ideas--Anil's and Mark's.  I think that we could discuss at 
 break and write it up then and turn in at beginning of second half of class.  
 I'd lean a bit toward the Amazon suggestion, but could go either way.

 Where did we get the readings for Thursday?  I can't seem to find them 
 anywhere.
  Can someone please fax me a copy?  My fax number is (415) 733-4190.
 
 Thanks

 Greetings:
 
 Sounds like I'm glad that I missed the quiz last week.
 
 Hate to be a nag, but we've got to turn in what we're doing for our project
 on Thursday.  I propose doing a nice, clean merger, which would allow us to
 do both comparative analysis (who are these companies?) and
 merger/valuation analysis.  Mark and I talked last night and I pleaded
 again not to do strict accounting stuff, but if that's what folks would
 like to do, I can certainly suck it up.  Any thoughts?
 
 Best,
 Jeff
