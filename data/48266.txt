 
 We discussed your training in our group meeting yesterday, and Mark gave me 
 the go ahead to do a training, preferably a lunch training, sometime in 
 April.  If you could get together with the members of our team and send me an 
 email of any items in particular you would like addressed, we will try to 
 address them in our training.  Also, if you could get some dates for me we'll 
 check them against our schedule.  Would your group organize this lunch or 
 ours?  How many people are we talking about.  Only Global Contract or Global 
 Counterparty too?  Let me know the details so we can start planning...
