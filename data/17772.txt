 
 Greetings:
 
 Are we supposed to do the reading and the Oracle and Legal Services cases for 
 Thursday?  Syllabus says yes, but I gather from Tasker's Izio not that we'll 
 be in the computer center all class doing modeling.  (I'd email her, but she 
 doesn't get my emails apparently.)  Anyone have a clue?
 
 Best,
 Jeff
