 returned as undeliverable.  I am sending the message again with only one 
 attachment and then will follow-up by sending the remaining two presentations 
 under separate messages due to the size of each of the files.
 
 Sorry for the delay.

 Ahmad,
 
 Thank you for the email.  I enjoyed our visit very much.  I wanted to thank 
 you for taking the time especially during your weekend to spend time away 
 from your family.  I learned a lot during the trip and I believe in the 
 Dolphin project.  I also liked many other of the project Rick's team has put 
 together in the Middle East.
 
 I promised you some of the speeches that I have delivered and attached below 
 are 3 different ones that illustrate Enron's view of the future.
 
 Thanks again.
 
 Mike
