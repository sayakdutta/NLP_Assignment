 already?)

 In the past couple of days, I have been deluged with
 last-minute requests to videoconference into the March 17
 hearing on the motions to dismiss.  We are well past the
 deadlines Sprint asked us to comply with (February 25 for
 private sites and March 1 for public sites).  At this stage,
 adding new sites to such a large, nationwide
 videoconference is extraordinarily burdensome, requiring
 Sprint to move the entire conference to a different bridging
 system, change the dial-in numbers, etc.  Also of importance
 is the fact that the bridging system has space limitations.
 
 Please e-mail me with all videoconference requests no later
 than 12 p.m. Mountain tomorrow (Friday, March 10).  After the
 noon cutoff, we will no longer be able to entertain additional
 videoconference requests.  In the meantime, I will do my
 best to accommodate the late requests we've received.
 
 I will be sending out a detailed memo tomorrow afternoon
 that lists all the sites that have been booked, along with
 those who've made reservations.  Each of you planning to
 videoconference will need to check carefully to be sure your
 reservation is reflected in my memo.  In addition, many of
 the sites have extremely limited seating, so please do not
 plan to show up at a public site without a reservation.
 
 Thanks to all of you for your consideration.
