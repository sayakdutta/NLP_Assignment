 I would like to  get with you, Janet, Melanie and whomever else is appropriate to discuss our overall strategy relating to the  rejection or assumption of our contracts.  She has expressed concern that we need to make these decisions quickly, to cut off claims by our customers for post petition nonperformance.  We should go over our overall strategy with her  about our various contract buckets, especially how much longer we can continue serving customers where we are putting them in a penalty situation.  
 Melanie will be out of town Monday and Tuesday, so I am going to set this up for tomorrow.  Please let me know who else should attend. Thanks.
