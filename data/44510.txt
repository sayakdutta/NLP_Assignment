 not aware that we were selling a pipeline to anyone.  Please advise?

 While I'm in the process of getting the appropriate information for Mr.
 Earp, one question.  Shouldn't we also have a bill of sale to accompany
 this document, registering the value to be paid for this property?
 
 Pls advise.
