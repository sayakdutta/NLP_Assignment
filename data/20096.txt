 
 FYI. Pretty good letter from large customers urging the PUC to vote down the rate agreement between DWR and the PUC. With Loretta announcing today (and signaling to the Republicans on the Commission) that she'll be voting no on the rate agreement tomorrow, it looks like Davis and Angelides are in for a bad day.  Sort of chokes you up.
 
 Best,
