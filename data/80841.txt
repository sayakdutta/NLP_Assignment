 Mike,
 
 We have an opportunity that may interest your management team.  We publish
 LNG Express and the related website www.LNGExpress.com.  LNG is a unique
 form of natural gas trade, representing some $20 billion per year and
 growing at 7-8%/year.  The industry is a fairly insular community.  Our
 publication, website, industry reports, databanks, annual conferences and
 consulting services have grown to be possibly the most visible.
 
 LNG has a growing spot and short-term contract market. There is currently no
 exchange for global trades.  Nor is there an exchange for carrier vessel
 capacity, excess plant capacity, e-procurement or remote gas leases.
 LNGExpress.com could be platform for such an exchange with content and
 readers already established.  We might also assist Enron sign up exclusive
 agreements with LNG suppliers and/or buyers.
 
 Please let me know your thoughts ASAP.  I suspect this window of opportunity
 will close quickly.
 
 Best regards,
