 Please let me know if you did anything with this or I will assign.  Since you 
 were copied, I didn't know if you had a conversation with Tanya or Soma.  
 Thanks.  Sara

 I have attached a credit worksheet per Sara's request in order to amend the B 
 of A master.  My understanding is that we intend to only amend the existing 
 document for holding and use of collateral so that we may be able to 
 rehypothecate collateral.  I have tried to construct the worksheet terms such 
 that they reflect what is in the current document, but the old document terms 
 should govern in the case of a discrepancy.  I will be out tomorrow, so 
 please contact Bill with questions.
 
 Thanks,
 Tanya
