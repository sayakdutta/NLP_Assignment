 Eric, here is my response to the paragraph (in SGSI's letter concerning the 
 money due for SGSI's work on the GeoQual web map project) which is underlined 
 on page 3 and which takes the position that if we did not have a written 
 Statement of Work in place, then SGSI owns all the work it did for us and we 
 must cease use of it.  You and Laura might want to use this paragraph in your 
 response to all his other business-related arguments.  (I might add, for the 
 record and as a point for the future, that we can easily get into this kind 
 of trouble when we don't take care to obtain signed Statements of Work before 
 the work starts.)
 
 Here it is:
 
 Mr. Schlosser, your letter states that the ePower Locator, GeoQual, Hamachi, 
 and Mountain Top applications are SGSI's intellectual property because the 
 parties do not have an executed Statement of Work.  This argument is 
 incorrect.  Both parties are bound by the fully executed professional 
 services contract, which clearly states in Article 17 that all material 
 developed by Consultant (SGSI) "shall become the property of Company (EBS) 
 when prepared."  Because the work, whether or not covered in a written 
 Statement of Work, was requested by EBS and performed by SGSI (subject to 
 EBS' concerns about such performance),  the work is clearly covered by the 
 Professional Services Contract, and the foregoing statement of ownership 
 applies.  Accordingly, EBS respectfully refuses your requests concerning such 
 work.
 
 
 
 
 
 Eric and Laura, I would be happy to look at the balance of the letter, once 
 you've written it.  You have my permission to go hard on these folks, if 
 their work was poor and there was no EBS authorization for them to run up 
 such high charges.
 
 
 Kenton
