 Paula -- we've received written questions from the New York Times for a weekend story.  I need your assistance on the following:
 
 Why, in securities filings this year, did Enron describe its principal business as "security brokers, dealers & flotation" when before it had said it was in the business of "wholesale-petroleum & petroleum products"?
 
 Has the board taken any action in regard to the events of the past week? 
 
 Have they called any special meetings?  formed any special committee? 
 
 Have they hired an attorney to review the situation? 
 
 I know you have several meetings today, but when you get a chance, would you give me a call or email me? 
 
 Thanks, Paula!
