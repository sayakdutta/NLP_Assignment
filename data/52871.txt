 
 Bob,
 
 Do you have a standard presentation on Enron's role in creating and
 growing the spot and forward markets for pulp and paper?
 
 We are helping the media group to make a pitch to a big
 customer ($40 billion in revenues) and we would like to provide some examples of our 
 skills in creating and growing new markets.
 
 
 Vince
 
 P.S. It's quite urgent: we were asked to help at the eleventh hour.
