 
 Becky,
 
 It's good to have you back...I don't think I've eaten at Luther's since the 
 last time we all went together.  Tomorrow's good for me.  How's it going 
 being back at work?  Did you have 50 million emails to plow through?

 OK, I smelled Luthers this morning.  It was killing me.  Yum, yum.  How about 
 lunch tomorrow?  B
 
 
 
    
 You were right.  That was pretty sick!!!
 
 Hey, let's all get together for lunch sometime.  When would be a good day?
