 
 Doug,
 
 Here's the revised CA.  I highlighted the changed terms.  In addition, I 
 deleted the prior paragraph 11 which said that the agreement supercedes a 
 prior CA.
 
 I don't know if the InterGen indentity and signatory are the same,  but 
 obviously I left that for you to determine.  I expect that the Enron entity 
 which will bid will be EPMI, so I used that entity.  
 
 
 
 I beefed up the definition of confidential information due to the complexity 
 of the issues, and I added 6 months to  the term since things won't get 
 cranked up for a while.
 
 I look forward to talking to you at your convenience.  Have a good weekend.
 
 Kay
