 
 Carla just changed this deal - must have defaulted to no confirm. We do want 
 it to be confirmed, and the deal has been changed to reflect that in Enpower.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
   
  
 This deal is input not to be confirmed.  Can you check into this and indicate 
 why it should not be confirmed.
 
 Thanks!
