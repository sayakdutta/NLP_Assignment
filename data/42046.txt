         > A man runs into the vet's office carrying his dog, screaming for
 help.
         > The vet rushes him back to an examination room and has him put his
 
 dog
         > down on the examination table. The vet examines the still, limp
 body
         > and after a few moments, tells the man that his dog, regrettably,
 is
         > dead. The man, clearly agitated and not willing to accept this,
         > demands a second opinion. The vet goes into the back room and
 comes
         > out with a cat and puts the cat down next to the dog's body. The
 cat
         > sniffs the body, walks from head to tail, poking and sniffing the
         > dog's body and finally looks at the vet and meows.
         >
         > The vet looks at the man and says, "I'm sorry, but the cat thinks
 that
         > you're dog is dead, too." The man is still unwilling to accept
 that
         > his dog is dead. So the vet brings in a black lab, the lab sniffs
 the
         > body, walks from head to tail, and finally looks at the vet and
 barks.
         > The vet looks at the man and says, "I'm sorry, but the lab thinks
 your
         > dog is dead too."
         >
         > The man, finally resigned to the diagnosis, thanks the vet and
 asks
         > how much he owes. The vet answers, "$650."
         >
         > "$650 to tell me my dog is dead?" exclaims the man.
         >
         > "Well," the vet replies, "I would only have charged you $50 for my
 
         > initial diagnosis. The additional $600 was for the cat scan and
 lab
         > tests."
