 
 Good morning.... Callaway Park buys Disney World ( Milly told me that one)..... 
 
 The Management is trying hard to put on a good face forward, but they fucked this one up nicely.
 
 My plans are simple.. hang out to see if I get paid... after that, not sure. 
 
 I am thinking about taking golf lessons... that how bad things have gotten.
 
 Yikes.. PS, send us a new e-mail of the kids...
 
 Thanks for the note, TIC. 
 
     
 
 
 talk about a $9 billion shotgun wedding....  
 what's the scoop down there... I trust you will come out of this ok.
 hang in there
