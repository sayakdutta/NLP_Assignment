 
 Hi!
 
 Of course I remember you!  How are you, and your son?  What have you been doing?  Do you ever get to see Marilyn and Poli?  How are things at Compaq?  Is the Compaq/HP merger going to happen?  Things are going well here (at Enron!?!?)...considering it is the "biggest corporate debacle" in history.  Thanks for asking about Meghan...she's 3, can you believe it?  Jim and I are about to take her to Disney World!
 
 Thanks for emailing me, please tell everyone I said "hello", and talk soon...
 
   
 
     
 
 Michelle,
 
 Hello, It's Sharee Payne...remember me?  We worked together in North
 America PCPG.

 How is Megan?
 
 Take Care,
 Sharee
