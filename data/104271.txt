 Did you ever receive a response on this?  If not, let's discuss.

 All:  Before Rod became a Brit, we were working with Enron Corp. treasury to 
 put in place some masters in the name of ENA for the following parties:
 
 Bear, Stearns Internaitonal Limited
 Credit Agricole Indosuez
 CSFB International
 Lehman Brother Finance S.A.
 Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc.
 Deutsche Bank
 
 These masters will be used to for equity deals on ENE stock.  The Treasury 
 group has concluded together with Rex Rogers and V&E, that Enron Corp. is the 
 appropriate swap counterparty for these masters and NOT ENA.
 
 Who in credit will be available to assist me in this process?  Thanks.  Sara
