 she said she would get it for me after this conference call.  Are there going to be more Enron layoffs?
 
  
     
 I spoke with Julie and asked her again as well....my only concern with UBS is that they are swamped at the moment, and these requests usually take a day or two to turnaround (I have put the request to UBS as well - so lets see who does it first!).
 
 Let me know if you get it from Julie or if I receive from UBS first, will give you a call to fax.

 I have asked her a couple of times, so if you have one that would be better.
 
 
 
  
     
 Good morning Cara!  Hope that you had a good weekend - when do you move into the new condo?
 
 1.  UBS payrolls are the same as Enron (isn't that nice - no change there)!
 
 2.  Julie Kearney should have a copy (I know she was keeping copies in case something happened to the fed ex packages).  Let me know if she doesn't have for some reason.
 
 Have a great day!

 Good Morning Darling,
 
 Do you know when the UBS paydays are?  We are just trying to figure out what to expect.
 
 Also,  I need a copy of my signed agreement with UBS, the loan folks for my new condo want it.  If you will fax it to me, but call me first so I can wait by the fax for it, I would be grateful.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Cara Freeland! ;)
