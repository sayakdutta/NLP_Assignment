 Chris--Attached is the spreadsheet that we spoke of earlier today.  I have 
 made
 the correction to TCO Op 2, Mkt Area 20 into NYSEG (i.e. +854 dth/day).   I
 will make the necessary changes to the AGL volumes over the next few minutes.
 As we discussed, we'll need to resolve the question about Central Hudson off
 Iroquois (we may not need any volumes there since Duke is the supplier), and 
 as
 I said, we'll be discussing our needs into southern Connecticut on a firm 
 basis
 with other suppliers.   I am also attaching the spreadsheet with the storage
 injections for assigned storage.   I believe that we need to negotiate the
 price for all of the  April storage injections.
