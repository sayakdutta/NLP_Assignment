 
 I feel fairly confident that you received change orders 1-4.  If not, please 
 advise.  One of those change orders changed the delivery dates for the LV Co 
 Gen equipment.
 
 
 
 






 
  
 The Guaranteed Delivery Dates in Section 10.2.1 were taken from the
 original agreement.  I am not aware of any change order modifying those
 dates.

 I'm reviewing.  Are dates in Section 10.2.1 correct?  Lee, I'll forward
 you
 my comments separately.
