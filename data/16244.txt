 I did not hear about the announcement - please send!!
 
 C1 is doing a demo integration with us.  We are having a hard time getting a
 booth at their conference, but at least we will be able to announce a loose
 partnership with them.
 
 We meet with Ariba tomorrow.
 
 How was the dome?  San Diego was beautiful!
