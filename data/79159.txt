 Please note that Amelia will be honored and the Committee will thank you for sponsorship (see below).  Amelia asked if you were being a guest.  Did you check with Judy and the kids?
 
  
     
 Julie, here is an email invitation, and I'll bring the hard copy tomorrow.  I have registered Danny on the website, so you'll get a confirmation (or he will) by email.  Here's the basic program:  There are only four private nominations from Houston on the torch relay.  The four companies asked to submit a nomination were Enron, Texas Instruments, Motorola, and a technology group from Rice University.  These four companies have one torchbearer each (me from Enron) who will be briefly honored at the reception.  Then the Lieutenant Governor of the State of Utah will thank Danny for Enron's nomination of a torchbearer (me), and three other companies will receive the same honor, and that's it, so it shouldn't be very time consuming for him.  They said the presentations would begin at 7:15 pm.
 

 
 Thanks for your help with this  (The RSVP link below gives you about the same info that you see here.)
