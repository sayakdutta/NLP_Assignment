 
 I'm going to visit with the Hermanator briefly tomorrow.  Would you like to 
 join me?

 Let's do 2:30 tomorrow for 30 minutes in 3394.
 
 
    
 Yikes.  Would you have just 30 minutes sometime during the afternoon 
 tomorrow?  I really struck out with everyone else for Friday.  Otherwise, 
 I'll be glad to schedule a meeting on Friday (in addition to this one 
 tomorrow) to review the structure with the various players.  You pick a time 
 (the earlier being better for me).
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay

 I am already booked solid tomorrow afternoon on another deal.  Friday is much 
 better.
 
 



   
 Looks like Thursday at 300pm is working out for most people to meet to 
 discuss the VEPCO PPA. The meeting will be held in EB38C1.
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.
