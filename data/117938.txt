 The above PDF file is the latest version of the TBMA/ISDA bankruptcy
 amendments reflecting discussions at yesterday's FDIC meeting.  Note that
 other regulators (including Treasury, SEC, CFTC, the FED (NY and Washington,
 FDIC) were also in attendance at yesterday's meeting.
 
 We currently await the outcome of this morning's staff meeting of financial
 regulators. The focus of this meeting was to discuss the BMA/ISDA amendment
 package.
