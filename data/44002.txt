 Attached is a marked-up draft of the Enron standard confidentiality 
 agreement.  Please review it and get back to me with your comments.
 
 Additionally, I have attached a copy of the Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement that 
 makes Ormet's changes to the Guarantee Agreement on Exhibit D consistent on 
 the Exhibit C Guarantee Agreement.
 
 Pending your comments on the Confidentialty Agreement, the only item 
 outstanding is the $1.5 million collateral threshhold.
 
 I look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible.
 
 Thanks,
 Mike
