 
 Melissa,   I would prefer to have Brian Bierbach sign.  His title is Vice 
 President.  Let me know if you need anything else.  
 Thanks.
 
 
 
 
 
 

    
 
 
 Gerald - I am preparing the affidavit, and we would prefer if it is signed
 by a business person, rather than a lawyer.  What was the name of the
 business person in Denver who was on the conference call when we
 were arranging this deal?  Would it be okay if he signed? Sorry I can't
 remember his name.
 
 Melissa
