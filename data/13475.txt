 Tara,
 
 You are right -- those changes were not included.  For Vice President level 
 employees, corporate comp.does not promote guaranteed performance bonuses.  
 
 The request that he be able to "get out" of his employment contract if he is 
 not promoted also is not something that we can do; otherwise, it will 
 undermine the enforceability of our non-competes across the board.
 
  I spoke with David Oxley on both of those points, and he concurred that 
 these changes could not be made. 
 
 Michelle

 Thanks for this, Twanda
 
 I have two comments; 
 
 1)I cannot find the exception clause which indicates that David Pope can 
 resign if he doesn't make MD as described in previous email. Am I missing 
 this or can we not put this in?
 
 2)Danny McCarty wanted guaranteed bonus for 2000 rather than performance 
 target bonus as per email. Is this possible?
 
 Thanks
 Tara
