 We need to make a small change in Edwards, AFB schedule for March 2002
 for the Excess hourly schedule (accounting line # 4783).  Since we will
 not be having any excess energy to schedule in the month of April 2002
 the HE 24  for March 31st will need to be changed from 2 MWs to 0 MWs. 
 I would suggest that HE 5 and HE 6 be increased by 1 MW each hour to new
 total of  2 MWs each hour.  The reason for doing this is for control
 area check out between WAPA in Mountain Standard Time and SCE in Pacific
 Standard Time.  We cannot have any excess energy accounted for in April
 by SCE in its control area.  
 
 I've attached a revised schedule with the March 31 adjustment described
 above.  We need to make this change and provide to SCE no later than COB
 Thursday, March 28th.  Let me know if you want to implement the change
 in the manner that I've done.  Thanks for your help.
