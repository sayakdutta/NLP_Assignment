 I would much rather go and annoy your happy butt as much as possible.  Plus
 it make me feel like I'm doing part of the work.  I just might come up and
 spend the night tonight.  Be there around 10:30 or 11.

     You win!   How you want your $20.   How about in dimes, unrolled.

    said he  would go, but kinda hee hawing around.   I'm going so I don't
    have
    to worry about Bonner having to wait on Don.   No sense in you going.
    Just a quick trip up and back.   I'll pick me up a book to listen to on
    the
    way.
