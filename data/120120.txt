 
 Rika, 
 I have had a request and I also think it is a good idea to put the regional gas price for the following regions.
 
 PJM - Transco Zone 6 Non New York
 NY - Transco Zone 6 New York
 NEPOOL - Algonquin
 
 The heat rates would then be calculated off the appropriate regional gas price.
 
 Thanks
 Paul
