 There's been a lot of shit happening with my company and frankely,
 I don't know what's going to happen over the next few months.  As a 
 result, we decided to wait at least a few months until our financial
 situation is better known.  
 
 Glad to hear everything's going well.  Did you go out to California?
 What are your plans over Thanksgiving?

 Chump,
 
 I've been super busy the last two weeks.  The pace seems to be cyclical and
 we are definitely in high gear right now.  I don't expect it to slack off
 until the Thanksgiving break with another push coming just before Xmas.  The
 good news is, I am a third of the way through.
 
 Did you ever get a car?
 
 Frank
 
 PS  Did you see WVU put up 80 on RU?  They suck!
