 riding.  I was just a little afraid I might need grease.

 Hey, FYI,
 
 I took your bike by Bikesport on Saturday and was going to leave it and the
 guy looked at it on the spot and said it looked to be in great condition.
 He aired up the tires and all I need to do is get on it and ride it!!!
 
 Thanks again.
 
 
 
 
     
 
 
 Offer still good.  How goes things with the new beau?  Also, thanks for the
 cooked meats.  They were delicious!

 Morning, Glory,
 
 Hope you are doing well and had a good weekend.
 
 I am still considering the MS 150 and wanted to know if your offer is still
 good for borrowing your bicycle.  If you have changed your mind, it is no
 big deal.  Promise!
