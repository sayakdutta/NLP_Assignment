 I think that we can arrange a few video conference meetings instead.
 I don't see a  justification for extending the stay over the weekend if we 
 have an alternative solution.

 I met Maureen yesterday and had a useful discussion on her role within 
 Enron.  I think it would be very helpful to promote the Research group 
 function of the company, particularly given Maureen's background,  if she 
 could be introduced to some of the main traders down at MG.  Unfortunately 
 she won't have time to meet with MG unless we can schedule some meetings on 
 Monday.
 
 Would you be happy for her to extend her stay here till Monday to allow the 
 meetings to take place?
 
 Regards
