 
 It might be worth it to add Long Term California to Greg's trader ID profile 
 - if it's not too much trouble. He said it was unlikely he'd use it, but 
 there's always the potential. No rush, of course. And thanks again for your 
 help.

 Hello again Kate,
 
 Please see the desks below that Greg Wolfe is attached, and inform me

 Hi Kate,
 
 Your request is complete, effective upon refresh of the EnPower System, or 
 3/17/01.
 
 Let us know if Paul needs access to any other desks.
 
 Best Rgds.

 Thanks for doing that so quickly. I just spoke with Paul and he said it would 
 be best to include every long term desk under his name since he will 
 potentially do deals with all of the traders -
 
 Long Term Southwest
 Long Term Northwest
 Long Term California
 Long Term West Management
 
 Again, thank you, and please let me know if there's anything else I can do.

 Hello Kate,
 
 I've added Paul Choi to the EnPower System, however, in order for a Trader or 
 Mid-Marketer
 to have access to a Power Desk, he must be added to the specific desk by the 
 GCP Team.
 
 Please supply a specific list of desks in which Paul Choi needs access.
 
 Example Request(s): 
 
 Please add these Power Trader(s) to the following Desks: Paul Choi, Greg Wolfe
 
 CP/ID 66189 (not required, but helpful)     EPMI Short Term West Hourly
 CP/ID 56849  "     EPMI Long Term West Management
 
 Thanks,

 Thank you in advance for you help in adding this trader's name to the system:
 
 Add this Power Trader to the EnPower: Paul Choi
 
 Samuel Schott has told me that you would prefer to have the desk this trader 
 works for, but because Paul is a mid-marketer he works with several different 
 desks, including Long Term California and Long Term Southwest. Please let me 
 know if you need more information.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate Symes
