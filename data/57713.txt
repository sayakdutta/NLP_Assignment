 Mr. Kean,
 
 I've attached a document outlining a proposal for an associate in Enron's
 Capital & Risk Management Services division to come and speak in several
 graduate and undergraduate classes this semester. Times and dates are 
 extremely
 negotiable. I will make all necessary arrangements to ensure a pleasant visit.
 
 Thank you for your time and have a great day. I look forward to hearing from
 you.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Rene Chapoton
