 Do I go and drop him off, or go?
 
 
 
     
 
 Hi, 
 Could you consider taking Nathan to Cub Scouts tonight?  Bruce is sick, so
 Becky and one of the other Dads are going to run the meeting.  Becky thought
 it would probably only be ? hour.  (This is a Den meeting, usually 1 hour,
 rather than the longer Pack meeting.)  It starts at 6:30.  Thanks.
