 
 I'd love to indulge you all with a repeat performance but I fear alas my liver would go on strike, and from what I understand the liver is a fairly vital organ...my stomach already expressed it's frustration with my behavior last Friday.
 
 Despite all of this I still look forward to engaging in engrossing AND coherent conversation with those of you who decide to show tonight.

 By the way, do we have a particular time in mind?
 
  
     
 Well, I feel like I missed out on a lot last Friday, hence the get together tonight.  The plan is the Front Porch right after work for anyone thats interested.  However, come knowing (good or bad) Susan, and most likely Eric, are foregoing a repeat performance. 
 
 So please forward to anyone I have missed and hope to see you there.
 
 Chris and Nick, I know its probably a long shot that the two of you will come, but thought I would try. Its been too long.
