 
 I think this is a detrimental reliance case or fraud.  I want to be 
 aggressive on this.  Richard, please let me know what theory is best.  Do we 
 have counsel for Washington?

 In the days immediately before the application for a price cap, Puget came to 
 us and asked us to enter into several put options.  We did so. I am advised 
 by the traders that if this price cap were to actually be in effect,  our put 
 option transactions would not make sense for us economically and we would 
 never have entered into them had we known of their intention to make this 
 filing.   I am under some pressure  to explain two things:  (i) whether the 
 fact that they knew they were going to file for the cap when they did the 
 options is some kind of fraud, and (ii) whether the WSPP Agreement or our 
 ISDA swap agreements have any clauses in them to address this kind of 
 thing,ie. is this some kind of "illegality" issue?  I am working on the 
 second issue and have discussed it with Mark Taylor, but on the first issue, 
 I need advice from Richard and anyone else who can help.----cgy

 Puget Sound has filed a complaint against all jurisdictional sellers of 
 wholesale energy and/or capacity in the Pacific Northwest, including parties 
 to WSPP agreement.  Puget Sound requests FERC to impose price cap on 
 wholesale sales of energy and capacity in the Pacific Northwest equal to the 
 lowest price cap "established, ordered, or permitted by the Commission for 
 wholesale purchases by the Cal ISO or Cal PX . . . ."  Puget requests an 
 effective date of December 25,2000.
