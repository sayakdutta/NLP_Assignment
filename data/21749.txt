 
 Guys, have we started the mobilization on the tear-down of the two 501FD's at 
 Gleason?  Will they be machining the equipment on site - it appears to me 
 that we should not let that equipment leave the site if possible.  Do we have 
 a credible site rep from Westinghouse for both Wheatland and Gleason?  
 
 Please advise.
 
 Thanks
 Delainey

 Guys, I understand that none of the facilities were available today - I 
 thought we were targeting 750 MW.  What is the updated availability schedule 
 for each unit?  We are only a couple of weeks from June 1.  Please advise.
 
 Regards
