 Mark,
 
 Thanks for the help.  I have worked with Anne Koehler a number of times in 
 the past; however, since this is specifically Net Works and may be more of an 
 acquisition than an investment, I wasn't sure who to contact.  Please find 
 attached a brief description of the Altra Gas Pipeline Software Business, 
 along with CIBC's Confidentiality Agreement.  I am sure you will have changes 
 to the CA, as a result, I will try to identify the appropriate contact at the 
 bank.  You may want to give me a call and/or Tom Gros to make sure all of his 
 concerns are addressed.
