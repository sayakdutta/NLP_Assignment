 About two years ago I asked Joe Hrgovcic
 to look tinto EVT applications. As far as I know
 he is the only person in the group, in addition to me, looking at EVT.

 Dear Vince,
 
 Back in July, when you visited our Sydney office you mentioned extreme value 
 theory. I am wondering whether research is looking into the application 
 of extreme value theory to power and esp. to weather. In a recent news 
 article it was highlighted that a trend in the industry towards t_max, t_min, 
 etc. 
 
 I am in particular referring to the news article below:
 
 http://213.219.22.254/i-wex/resources/ef290600.htm
 
 In the past we have observed a similar trend where customers are asking for 
 t_max, t_min, or below or above precipitation structures. The choice in the
 past has been the burn analysis on historical data. However, we are in 
 particular interested in the extreme events, and the application of EVT could 
 provide a meaningful tool for the analysis. 
 
 Has the research group looked into the application of EVT to weather? EVT has 
 a long history of application in hydrology (which would cover parts 
 of the precipitation structures...). Also, research (esp. at ETH in Zuerich) 

 
 
 Thank you! 
 
 
 Regards,
 Christian
