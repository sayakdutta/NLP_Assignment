 As per our telephone conversation, Bill Bradford and Anthony Lupiano
 have reached agreement in regards to the credit Threshold matrix.   The
 credit rating and thresholds are as follows:
 
 BBB+/Baa1 or above:    $15 million
 BBB/Baa2:  $10 million
 BBB-/Baa3:  $5 million
 Below BBB-/Baa3:  Zero
 
 Attached you will find a revised Fourth Amendment.   Please arrange for
 it to be executed and return to my attention.
 
 Many thanks and regards,
