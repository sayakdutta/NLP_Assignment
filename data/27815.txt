 have outsourced the mail room function--quality control has gone to hell.  
 Come to Omaha and hang out for a couple of days and I'll give you some pics 
 in person!  DF

 Which I have done - and is not bad, depending on who is doing the
 staking...

 Seems to me they were looking for Flynn 10 years ago, too. I remember at
 that time, Rod Merriam told me something about how the "FBI" was looking
 for Flynn, at least according to his mom. I DO remember that he was filing
 for bankruptcy in the mid-80's. Then he dissapeared. (Used to live in
 Crystal, or New Hope or somewhere.)

 Oh,....I got it. And a professional job it was, too. Notice that there is
 no "send to" address. Only phone #'s.
 
 Yeah- like I'm gonna call Jeff Hogue.
