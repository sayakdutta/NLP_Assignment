 Do you have any documentation on a gas lift deal with Coastal?Engage? at

 Heidi-  There should be a deal ticket in Sitara for this sale to Engage, but 
 it looks as though 12/99 was the last month a deal was entered 
 (IF/HSC+1.00).  George/Craig- could you guys coordinate who should be rolling 
 this deal or let us know if this gas should not be flowing?  Heidi-  
 historically we've been charging $.60/mm for this transport.

 I am finding flow out there on HPL 215 for meter 1520 (Tx City Coastal 
 States) starting 4/1/00 (actually, no volume was scheduled but looks like it 
 has been allocated since March 1).  Did you want a premium rate for this?
