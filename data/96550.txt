 
 Hi John - You are in good company - I never call or write those I care about; 
 only my "enemies" get to hear or see me.  And if that doesn't tell you how I 
 spend my time, nothing will.  Now that summer is almost upon us (its only 92 
 degrees in Houston), I hope for more.  Give me a call and lets try to catch 
 up this week.
 
 Hope all is well for you.
