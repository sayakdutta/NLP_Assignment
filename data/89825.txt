 This guy claims to have an emerging solar generating technology that he is investigating the feasibility of.  I gave him a primer on what one would need to do to interconnect to the grid and sell to the market.  I invited him to call me if they get to the point of pitching this technology or if they are seeking development capital.  Are you ready to go long solar!!

 I received this note from the EES Business Center.  Can someone from your shop follow-up?  I called this gentleman and couldn't get a definitive answer related to how the power is being generated or how much.  This may be a wild-goose chase.  I'm just not sure.
