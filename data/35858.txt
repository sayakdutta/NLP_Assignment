 Jeff;
 I recommend that CES have ENA match the pricing for each package that has 
 been bid.  This means that we will let the unbid portion of capacity remain 
 under the posting.
 
 Please copy me on your e-mail to ENA.  Thanks
 
 
 
 

    
 
 This should do it. I believe the BGE Rate Schedule on CNG is GSS. Call if you
 need more info.

 I will have a discussion with Dick Jenkins on Tuesday afternoon.  I will
 see what he can offer to us in terms of of bundled delivered package.  ENA
 has 23K a day going to Zone 5.  They should be willing to deal.  Is there
 anyway you can take a stab at what our position is from Nov 00 to Oct 01 by
 zone and op, less the winter storage and SST that we own?  I need a good
 idea what our needs are.  I could compile this myself but I am loaded up on
 finalizing the deal on Monday.  Thanks
 
 
 
 

 
    
 
 Surprisingly, 12,485 of our 15,500 dth/d of capacity that TCO had put out
 for
 bid, has been bid on for between the minimum, $5.171 and $5.1807. CES
 currently
 has it from 11/99 to 10/00 for $4.56.  We have until 7/6 to tell ENA, as
 our
 agent, to tell TCO whether we want to match those bids for the next year or
 let
 it go to the bidders.
 Also here is an update on the non theoretical storage.
