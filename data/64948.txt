 
 there is more than enough room.  there is parking just in the street 
 somewhere.  you might be able to get rock star parking in the front of the 
 place.  if not, just find some place out on the street.  no camo or bright 
 orange and dont make duck calls all night.  i will be there at 6pm.  should 
 be a good weekend.  see you soon.
