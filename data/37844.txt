 
 You all have done an excellent job with the gas daily products.  I have been 
 asked to follow up with you guys to ensure that the products are rolled out 
 on EOL at the same time each day and that they be managed in the same manner 
 that you manage your cash products each day.  We have been asked to have one 
 a day up at all times with a relatively tight two way and to provide market 
 depth.  You may provide market depth, offset to last trade, or use last trade 
 mid functions.  Let me know if you have any questions or concerns regarding 
 this request.
 
 Thanks,
 Mike
