 meet in my office as a team to quickly prioritize tasks for the week 
 regarding the commercialization of our services.  While we will certainly 
 draw upon the knowledge of  others within Operations, we will consider this 
 to be the core resource team.  We want to continue to build momentum for this 
 effort.  Knowing that we are all stretched in managing the day-to-day 
 business, this quick focus each week on the key tasks will keep all of us 
 informed and in alignment.  Thanks!
