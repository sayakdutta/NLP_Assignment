 
 Don't know about the AGA....Seems to be that we are having harder and harder tme as an industry getting it right.
 
 I flew to little rock last weekend for a BPPP bonanza school and had a really cool instructor who was a retired colonel in USAF and F4 pilot. Lots of good stories. Beautiful weeknd for flying.
 Saw Jack Hirsch but didn't ask him about his club's bonanza...
 
 How is yor flying going ?
