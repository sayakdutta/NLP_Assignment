 I tried to call but your phone was busy. I'm an unofficial advisor to the
 White House energy team and they've asked me if Enron's bankruptcy presents
 a potential systemic risk. I told them I did not think so.
 
 This is FYI only... as I am unencumbered by the facts, it was only a
 judgment call on my part.
 
 Feel free to call me at 781 245 2036.
 
 Best of luck... we're thinking of you and wish for the very best.
 
 Ed
