 DO NOT PUT THE CONTRACTOR COMMENTS IN THE B/O CONTRACTS.
 
 I sent a copy to Lee Johnson when first received.  I asked Lee if the 
 comments had any merit.  (Mostly pertaining to scope of supply comments.)  I 
 have not heard back from Lee.
 
 I would expect Lee to let me know if any of the comments would have needed to 
 be incorporated.
