   Cc: IEP Board of Directors
  RE: Legislative Status Report Week Ending 2/16
 
 
 RECENT EVENTS:
 
 -- The Governor=01,s press conference today provided no surprises. Davis
 annouced the framework of a recovery plan for the IOUs that include the
 purchase of their transmission system and a dedicated rate component, not a
 rate increase, on consumers=01, electric bills to allow the utilities to ma=
 ke
 payments to their creditors.  A transcript of the press conference will be
 available later on the Goveronr=01,s web site.
 
 --  As reported earlier this week, the Senate Energy Committee amended and
 passed out SB 6x (Burton), which would establish and state power and
 financing authority, and SB 33x (Burton) which would require the Governor=
 =01,s
 plan to purchase the IOU=01,s transmission to be approved first by the
 Legislature.  Both measures were amended in the Senate Appropriations
 committee and passed out the following day.
 
 In response to Burton=01,s commitment to work with IEP on language limiting=
  the
 Authority=01,s eminent domain powers, IEP has drafted amendments which will=
  be
 presented to Burton staff next week.  At this point, however, I have no
 confidence we will come to any resolution.  Sen. Morrow had a similar
 commitment to fence-in the Authority=01,s =01&adequate reserve capacity=018=
  role, but
 has since given up due to any lack of progress and believes Burton does wan=
 t
 much more authority than merely ensuring reserve capacity.   Given the
 likelihood IEP will not gets its amendment, although we will continue to
 push for it on the Assembly side, we will need to reassess our position on
 this measure.  Considering there doesn=01,t appear to be anything stopping
 either of these bills from making it to the Governor=01,s desk, any opposit=
 ion
 efforts may be futile.
 
 So much for the good news.
 
 -- Siting:  IEP counsel Chris Ellison and I were able to spend a
 considerable amount of time this week with Senator Sher=01,s staff to talk
 about siting issues.  Generally, we believe the meetings went very well and
 we were able to provide comment both on SB 28x and many other siting issues
 not address in the bill.  E+M is still working on putting together an
 official IEP package of siting proposals which should be ready for final
 comment on Tuesday.  There is no indication when SB 28x will be heard.  The
 Senate Energy Committee may have a hearing on Thursday next week but has no=
 t
 decided for sure or what bills will be hears.  We will be anticipating that
 siting is one of them.
 
 -- QFs:  As reported by Steven Kelley this week, recent discussions with
 Sen. Battin indicated that he is attempting to work with the Governor's
 office on language that would, among other things, provide a linkage to the
 "mega bill" and/or stronger language on payment for past due amounts. At
 this point in time, the Governor's office has not responded to Battin's
 request.  While the QF bill could begin moving at any time, pending the
 Governor's action, it is increasingly likely that the QF legislation may no=
 t
 go before the =01&mega=018 bill.
 
  -- The Senate Energy committee also held an informational hearing this wee=
 k
 on the state=01,s audit of the CPUC=01,s audits of SCE and PG&E.  This is t=
 he link
 to the State Auditor=01,s review:
 http://www.senate.ca.gov/ftp/SEN/COMMITTEE/STANDING/ENERGY/_home/Audit.htm.
 From my initial review it appears as if the State Auditor believes there
 were several major issues not handled in the CPUC audits.  Surprised?
 
 -- This week=01,s ECA committee hearing on interruptible programs was cance=
 led.
 
 -- The proposed ECA committee hearing next Tuesday to address Asm. Wright=
 =01,s
 repower bill, AB 36x, may also be cancelled.  E+M is currently researching
 what permitted, current and proposed repower projects would be able to meet
 the definition currently outlined in the bill.  If you have knowledge of an=
 y
 of these projects and can assist with this research, please call me.  Wrigh=
 t
 =01,s office is asking for specific examples to help justify the amendments=
  we
 are requesting..
 
 -- McNally/Temple provided a report on this week=01,s energy briefing for t=
 he
 Assembly Republican caucus which went very well.  According to M/T=01,s rep=
 ort,
 members were appreciative of IEP taking the time to do this and several
 members acknowledged that
 they had never heard the message communicated in such a clear, concise way
 
 --  Attached is the most recent legislative tracking report which includes
 all the special session bills introduced to date.  The report is now 116
 bill strong.  Please let me know if you need copies of any of these bills.
 
 
 UPCOMING EVENTS (?):
 
 -- Monday, February 19th is a holiday so the Legislature will be off, as
 will I.
 
 -- The Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee may have a hearing
 on Tuesday to possibly hear AB 36x (Wright).
 
 -- Senate Energy Committee may meet on Thursday to hear bills to be
 announced.
