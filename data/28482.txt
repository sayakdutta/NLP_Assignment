 
 Great to hear from you!  I'll forward this to the smart guys and see if they 
 have any interest.  Let me know which pipes you'll interconnect with and 
 we'll have a better sense of who else in the organization might be 
 interested.  Kent and Morgan, when we get Tony's response on the 
 interconnects, can you think it through from Florida's perspective also?  
 Thanks.  DF
