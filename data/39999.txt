 You are a director of Pacific Energy Financing Ltd.  I am in the process of 
 converting this Cayman Islands company to a St. Lucia company.  The process 
 requires me to obtain a copy of each directors' passport (only the pages with 
 the photo and name information).   After obtaining the copies I will prepare 
 a statement to attach to the copy and return for each directors' signature.
 
 Please let me know when the copies are available and I will send someone to 
 pick them up.  Thank you for your cooperation.
