 Here are my selections.  We will be interviewing 60 candidates in the first 
 round of interviews, so you can actually select more than 10-12 candidates to 
 put on the closed list.  Also, I've attached  2 resumes from students who 
 have been corresponding with me since the presentation.  Both are interested 
 in Associate positions, but for some reason were not included in the resume 
 book.

 Resume books are being distributed tomorrow morning and should arrive at your 
 EB location later in the day.  Please review the resumes and select 10-12 
 candidates you believe should be on the closed list.  I need your selections 
 no later than Wednesday October 11th because the closed list is due in the 
 Career Management office the following day.  Send your selections via email 
 and carbon copy my coordinator Alyse Herasimchuk.  Thank you for your 
 participation and I look forward to another successful recruiting season at 
 Wharton.
 
 If you have any questions feel free to call me at extension 53214.
