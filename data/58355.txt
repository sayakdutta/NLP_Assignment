 Steve, our theme for the stock celebration is "Oh, The Places You'll Go," 
 which is the title of a Dr. Seuss book.  Everyone on the team loves this idea 
 because the messages in the book represent Enron thinking and culture.  In 
 case, you aren't familiar with the book, Beth Tilney has a copy.  Our plan is 
 to give every employee a book, which will have a note of appreciation on the 
 inside cover from Ken, Jeff and Joe.  We are contacting Random House (who 
 will contact the Seuss estate) to see if we can purchase 20,000 copies and to 
 get permission to use some of the copy in our internal communication 
 materials. The per unit cost is considerably lower due to the volume.
 
 We think employees will like this idea.  What do you think?
 
 Mary
