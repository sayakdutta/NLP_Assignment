 Richard, Andy, 
 
 Ted has been served with a Notice to Produce Documents in litigation between Fred Greenberg (plaintiff) and the Corp board of directors (attached below). The docs Ted is required to produce relate to benefits he may have received from a number of Enron related finance entities in his capacity as Representative of those entities. 
 
 I presume this request can be dealt with entirely in Houston and substantially without Ted's involvement (?). I'd be grateful if you could confirm what the process will be for dealing with this and what input, if any, you will require from Ted. 
 
 Thanks
 
 
 								Mark
