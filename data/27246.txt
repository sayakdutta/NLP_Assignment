 I have a business question,  for a change.   Ercot load is forecast to be as high as 46,124 for hour ending 1200 today.   The actual printed from the website is less than 43,000.   I know that there is South to North congestion,   but is this actual load right?    Is interruptible load being curtailed due to the congestion or is their rain somewhere that isnt showing on our weathermap?
 
 Any help you can give would be appreciated.   I dont think that this is proprietary info or anything.    I am trying to see if the forecast is worthless.
 
 Thanks,
 JMF
