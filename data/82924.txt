 As you know, Mog has been selected for the trading track program.  Her 
 initial rotation is scheduled to be in the structuring group with a follow-up 
 rotation in the back room.  However, she would like to do her initial 
 trading-track rotation in the middle-marketing group.  She would be 
 supporting the New York office (in Houston) where she would be assisting Per 
 Sekse and Carolyn Abramo, marketing to and executing on behalf of commodity 
 hedge funds.  I think this rotation would be very valuable in her 
 trading-track rotation.  After her rotation in this group, she would then 
 proceed with subsequent rotations as previously scheduled.  Since those of 
 you noted above had already agreed on the rotation schedule, John Lavorato 
 asked me to secure your agreement for this change.  He is agreeable provided 
 those of you noted are in agreement as well.  The middle-marketing group 
 would greatly welcome Mog and as I mentioned, I feel this rotation would be 
 very valuable to her as a potential trader in the future.  If I do not 
 receive an objection by Thursday, 5:00 P.M. - I will assume we can proceed 
 ahead.  Thanks for your cooperation.
