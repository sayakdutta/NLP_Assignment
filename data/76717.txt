 
 Scott/Stephen, I'm trying to summarize the essence of these performance 
 guarantees, similiar to what I have for heat rate.  I'm sure I've got 
 something on output and probably reliability, but can you give me a thumb 
 nail sketch of what we are looking for on the rest?
 
 10.3.1   Heat Rate Guarantee.  Seller guarantees that the Heat Rate as 
 measured for each of the Units 
 as demonstrated during the Performance Test, shall be __BTU/kWh. In the event 
 the Heat Rate exceeds the Minimum Heat Rate Guarantee, Seller shall take all 
 necessary actions to correct, retest the deficient Unit and cause the 
 deficient Unit to meet the Minimum Heat Rate Guarantee.  Failure to meet the 
 Heat Rate Guarantee shall prevent Acceptance, unless Purchaser explicitly 
 waives this guarantee in writing.  
 
 {we have a definition of heat rate}
 
 10.3.2   Electrical Output Guarantee.  
   
 10.3.3   Emissions Guarantee. 
 
 10.3.4   Water Consumption Guarantee. 
 
 10.3.5 Sound Guarantee.
 
 10.3.6 Reliability.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
