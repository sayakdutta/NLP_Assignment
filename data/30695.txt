 FYI - Rod indicated that this demo might be of use -relative to- alternative cost center and other reporting solutions.
 This is a solution broadband is using.

 Jim, I'd be happy to schedule a demo with you at your convenience. I'm available anytime this week except early on Wednesday and Thursday 1:00-2:00. Any other time would be fine.

 I would like to set up another look at what you have shown Steve and I, for the audience on the cc line.
 Jim: would you take the lead in setting up a short demo.
