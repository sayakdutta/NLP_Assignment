 i work from 5am to 5pm and it takes me 45 minutes to walk to work from my mom's house where i live unhappily in the basement.  
 
  
     
 Dude...this is unbelievable.  I started the banter on the bottom.  This is
 with the girl that I'm supposed to go to lunch with today.
 
 You don't have to apologize, I'm a pretty curious person myself.
 
 I work from 8 to 5 and walk to work.  It takes me about 20 minutes.  I live
 on 10th Street and 14th Ave.  Now it's your turn...
 
 
     
 
 What time do you typically get off work?  And where do you live?  (Walk to
 work?)  Sorry about all the personal questions, but I have a curious nature.
