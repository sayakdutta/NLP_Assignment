 Dan and Greg,
 
 Attached is a proposed combined gty that TXU is now proposing because of the 
 time constraints (one Gty expired yesterday and another is about to expire on 
 the 15th).  They would like to combine the business of ENA, ECC with two of 
 their trading entities for a total of $50MM.  This format does not include 
 the deregulation  language that the prior gty that I sent you both to review 
 back in March (they are doing this simply to expedite the process).  Please 
 review this format and get back to me with any comments/revisions so that I 
 can communicate them to the counterparty ASAP.
 
 Thanks--
 
 Veronica

 Just wanted to let you know that I still have not received word from either 
 attorney about their acceptance.  So, we haven't received the gty yet.  Let 
 me know what we should do.

 Peter and Dan--
 
 TXU is in the process of amending the current Guaranty to have the cap amount 
 increased due to an increase in trading.  Please review the attached document 
 and send any commentary back to my attention.  The beneficiaries involved are 
 both Enron North America Corp. and Enron Canada Corp.
 
 I would appreciate a prompt response in order to have the Guaranty executed 
 as soon as possible by the counterparty due to the current exposure that we 
 currently have out to them.
 
 
 
 Thank you,
 
 Veronica Espinoza
