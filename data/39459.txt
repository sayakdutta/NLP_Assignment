 hear directly from us that we are not happy with the position he has taken re 
 electronic trading.  Silence by us could be misinterpreted by him.  Let me 
 know what you think.

 Do you really this the right avenue would be directly to Rappaport - isn't it 
 his target audience?
 
 Do we need to do this - do you think the other exchanges will do something?
 
 
    
  
 Rappaport's comments are potentially very negative to us.  I think we should 
 write him a letter in protest.    Mark
