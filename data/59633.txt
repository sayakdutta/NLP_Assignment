 It was just a funny song making fun of Enron.  You didn't miss out on much.
 I signed the offer letter last week, and we went through the orientation and filled out the piles of paperwork.  I won't have the new title and company name officially until the 8th I heard.  
 
 What is up with you?  How's the car treating you?  Were you able to sell the maroon thing?
 I'm house shopping now, I want to build one, just don't know where.  It is fun looking though.
 
 Talk to you later,

 Hey,
 
 Are you officially an employee of the new company ?  If so when are they
 going to start flowing gas again?  I tried execute the attached file but was
 unable.  What was it?  Anything else going on?
