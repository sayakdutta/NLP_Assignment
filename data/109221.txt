 Hunter:
 
 The equipment is installed behind Rain's desk and the network port has been 
 made active.  The Server Team has to activate the sender, but they're running 
 some printer issues this afternoon, and may not be able to get to it today.  
 I am leaving for vacation today so the Remedy ticket # is: 170276.  You can 
 call x34888 and reference the ticket number for tracking while I'm gone.  The 
 Team Lead for Trader Support on your floor is Don Adam, and he may be able to 
 help facilitate a resolution for you if nothing happens by tomorrow afternoon.
 
 Regards,
 
 Steve
