 and I think I may have found something.  I have a letter from you to Jeff 
 dated November 15, 2000, regarding a wire transfer in the amount of 
 $110,109.00.  It broadly outlines expenses and references an attached report, 
 which I unfortunately do not have.  Would this letter be of any help to you?  
 Please let me know, and I'll be happy to send it right to where ever you 
 designate.  SRS
 
 
 
 

   
  
 
 Hi Jeff,
 
 I was trying to get a copy of the expense report of Swanswalk (the company
 we set up to buy the house in Rio) and I discovered that unfortunately my
 copy is in the boxes I sent to London from Brazil and they still have not
 cleared customs in the U.K. If you recall, I sent you a copy of the report a
 few months ago and I was wondering if you kept a copy in your files. If you
 did can you please fax me a copy in the U.K at 011-44-2078239871?
 
 Thanks and I hope all is well with you.
 
 Diomedes.
