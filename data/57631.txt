 Regarding voicemail I left you regading my current compensation, I  do not 
 intend to bug you about this, but at some point, I would appreciate knowing 
 whether my  base compensation ( and stock compensation  given recent price 
 movements )  are set at the appropriate level, in relationship to peers in 
 public affairs, company, and externally. Thanks.
