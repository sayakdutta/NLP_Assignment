 know 
 why.  It seems that some of the desks have some functions but mine never 
 does.   My desk
 seems to be pretty apathetic (probably not a good thing).  I think we've 
 relied, more than
 any of our other desks, on the financial and e-commerce sides of the 
 business.  Probably
 not a great thing.  Anyway, lets get together for a cocktail or dinner 
 sometime within the 
 next month.  Did you guys move to the Galleria location yet.  Let me know - 
 we'll go get 
 a big steak at Morton's or Ruths' Chris.  I assume a country boy like you is 
 into some
 good red meat.
