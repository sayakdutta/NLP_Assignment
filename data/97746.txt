 John, 
              We were dug up at two locations between Liberty and Beaumont by 
 a contractor working for PF Net on Monday, June 26.  The contractor was 
 Dan-Rik Construction Company out of Lafayette, La.   The contractor hit and 
 damaged our facility at two locations, one being between our existing splice 
 # 1 and splice #2,  three thousand feet of China.   The other location is 
 under a canal, in the same vicinity.  
 
    The contractor contact information is : Dan Rik Construction Company

    We are in the process of  restoring our facilities and will invoice 'Dan 
 Rik Construction'  all costs associated with the restoration.   PF Net is 
 following our route through Texas into Louisiana and I am concerned about 
 dig-ups that may occur bwtween China and the Louisiana border.  Is an 
 injunction the only way to keep them a safe and reasonable distance from our 
 facitlity?  Can we somehow put them on notice that we won't tolerate any 
 future dig-ups and that if they do  damage our facility, we will replace it 
 from splice to splice at their expense?  Please let me know.  
 
 Thank you.
