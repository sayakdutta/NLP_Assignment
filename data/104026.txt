 
 Ken:  Where can I find the CFTC's statement that the swap policy statement is 
 not available for agricultural trade options?  We are in a "holding pattern" 
 for the time being.  No products have been developed.  Thanks.  Sara

 With respect to agricultural trade options, the CFTC has specifically said 
 that the swaps exemtion and the swaps policy statement are not available.  I 
 will call you.
 

 
 Ken:  In connection with our new product (and  absence of any physical 
 activity
 in that product), I have the following question:
 
 If neither ENA nor its counterparty is able to qualify as an offeree for
 purposes of the Trade Option Exemption (17 CFR Sec. 32.13, as amended) but 
 each
 is an eligible swap participant (or better yet, each party has $10 million in
 net worth as per Sec. 32.13) can the option still be exempt from CFTC 
 regulation
 under the Swap Policy Statement or any CFTC interpretive letters?
 
 I have concerns about not relying fully on the Trade Option Exemption but I 
 also
 understood that the CFTC has informally said that the Swap Policy Statement
 provides a safe harbor for both swaps and options.
 
 I am available to speak at your convenience.  Thanks.  Sara [713/853-5620]
