 Mark, please assign this matter.  (Was a prior deal done out of Canada?)  Thank you.
 
 Nicole, Mark Taylor will assign this matter to an attorney in our group.  I am unaware of "Alberta docs" and also am not aware of a master netting agreement with RBC.  Mark Taylor will advise as to who will be handling this file.  
 
 Thanks.  Mary
 
  
     
 Hi Mary - 
 
 Guess things really come full circle at Enron - it looks like we may be working together again.  I am working in the Global Finance Group in London and Bill Appleby and I are looking to do an oil prepay with RBC.  I understand that you are one of the attorneys who will work on this with us.  I have actually never worked through the prepay documentation, and was wondering if you could send over some standard prepay doc language.  Better yet, if you have the Alberta docs, could you please send those (I believe that this was the last prepay we did with RBC).  Also, could we get a copy of the master netting agreement with RBC. 
 
 Thanks so much.
 
 Look forward to working with you again!
 
 Nicole
