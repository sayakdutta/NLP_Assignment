 and me in Houston over the next couple of months.  We will probably first 
 meet in Jim's office and then go to lunch.  Mark

 Mark, received your voice-mail. Our national Chairman, David Jackson, and I 
 are at your disposal. Just give us a bit of a heads-up on timing and we will 
 come to Houston. Best regards, Dan.
