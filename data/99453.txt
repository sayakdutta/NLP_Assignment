Paul was going to get together with the commercial team and see if they had any issues. Paul will contact you today with these changes/additions. If they are not substantive, I don't need to see them. Send Limor, Paul, and me a copy of the filed pleading. Thanks for your help.

 Paul: 
 We will get you a draft by the end of the day on Wednesday.  You are correct that our answer (or other pleading) is due on Monday, September 17.
 Let me know if you have any questions.

 REQUEST FOR LEGAL ADVICE 
   
 Thank you for the written advice. Obviously prospects of success 
 assessed at "[no] more than 50%..." (ie. definitely less than 50%) is 
 depressing, given initial expectations. We now need to maximise our 
 bargaining power for acquisition of the smelter through the litigation 
 which McCook have forced on us. 
   
 We look forward to receiving the draft Defence and Counterclaim for 
 comments/approval. We will need this fairly urgently, since the 20 day 
 period for service expires next Monday, 17 Sept 2001 (according to my 
 calculations - please confirm). Can you please ensure that they are sent 
 to all the copy parties on the email (now including Houston litigation 
 dept). Thank you.

          PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL 
         All:  Attached is our follow-up memorandum regarding the merits 
 of Enron's claim to enforce the Tolling Agreement against Longview. 
 Please feel free to contact either Rick or me if you have any questions.
