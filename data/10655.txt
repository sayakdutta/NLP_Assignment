 Let's look at it Wednesday. Also, with the high flows we got coming up from the south now, let's make sure we don't limit our capacity by doing this. thanks. sj

 I vote for Wednesday.  As you mention, we would be sure that Continental is running.  It would also be financially beneficial for Oneok to wait.

 Guess we better look at turning the C line around on the 31st, or should we wait until the 2nd, to make sure they get up? sj
