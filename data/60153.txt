 
 Can we meet after we are sold - things are very hectic now.  How about some time in February?
 
  
     
 
 Happy New Year. 
 I know you must be very busy, but I would enjoy the  opportunity to spend a few minutes with you to discuss the former CommodityLogic  group, now CLPartners.
 Please let me know where and when would be  convenient for you.
  
 All the best,
  
 Tom
