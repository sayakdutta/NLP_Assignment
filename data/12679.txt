 stations from around the world</A>
 
 This is a good site to quickly find worldwide radio stations on the
 internet....can sort any way first by continent then by news, talk, type of
 music etc.   Can be very interesting to "tune in" to say a world hot spot
 when something is happening.  I go to KOMA and Bob Brinker and Guam from
 here.   For instance, there was some news on a possible military takeover on
 the island of Fiji this morning...i went to a Fiji news station.
