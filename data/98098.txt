 
 I just wanted to remind everyone involved with the TVA litigation (and 
 potential litigation) to be mindful of the possibility that some of our 
 internal communications in the next several weeks may be the subject of TVA 
 discovery requests in the coming months. Please do not generate any notes or 
 e-mails without talking to me first. When scheduling meetings regarding 
 strategy, please include an attorney so that we can protect the 
 communications through the attorney-client privilege. If you have any 
 questions about this procedure, do not hesitate to call me at ext. 35587
