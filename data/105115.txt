 
 Hello there!  Hope all is well.  Will you be at the legal conference later 
 this month?
 
 Would you please provide us with information identifying the specific entity 
 requiring the brokerage account and a brief description of the transaction 
 for which the account is required.  Also, for purposes of your unanimous 
 consent or resolution,  you should note that either of Ted Murphy or Rick Buy 
 should be one of the two signatories required for opening the account.  Let 
 me know if you have any questions.  Sara
