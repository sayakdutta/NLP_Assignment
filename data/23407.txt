 Jim Bouillion of CRM and Gary Cooney of McGriff, Seibels (our insurance broker) asked that I raise three matters with you: 1. Scheduling of a meeting with the D & O carriers' counsel; 2. Obtaining additional D & O coverage; and, 3. Defense counsel selection in light of the possible "advise of counsel" defense and subrogation rights of the carriers.  I know that you are covered up, but I would not expect discussion of these issues to take more than 15 minutes. I will wait to hear form you or Steph. Thanks.
