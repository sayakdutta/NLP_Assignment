 How do we work together to set the bogie? I know on the MDEA deal there was an agreement on how it was calculated, including an agreement re the heat rates of the various units. 
 
 Is this a gas only facility? 
 
 How do we handle the transmission costs, or will we be selling the power at the same spot they are delivering it?
 
 Are there minimum units of energy they will start their facility up for?
 
 Thanks,

 We'll be marketing power from their Kenansville plant on a unit contingent basis.  Together, we will establish a bogie price (their marginal cost of generation), and any value we can get them above this bogie price will earn us 25% of the extra upside we manage to get them.  They have a right to terminate with a 30-day notice and/or sell their power to other third parties at anytime.

 Getting warmer.  Could you send me an email with a brief description of how you see us marketing their energy.
