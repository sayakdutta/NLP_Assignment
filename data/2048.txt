 The Office of the Chairman would like to invite you to participate at an=20
 Enron Executive Forum.  This invitation is extended to
 anyone who attended an Executive Impact and Influence Program within the pa=
 st=20
 two years.  These informal, interactive forums
 will be 90 minutes in length and held several times per year.
 
 Most of the participants in the Executive Impact and Influence program have=
 =20
 indicated a strong desire to express opinions, share
 ideas, and ask questions to the Office of the Chairman. Although not=20
 mandatory to attend, the forums are designed to address those issues.  They=
 =20
 also afford the Office of the Chairman opportunities to speak directly to i=
 ts=20
 executive team, describe plans and initiatives, do =01&reality checks=018, =
 create a=20
 =01&rallying point=018 and ensure Enron=01,s executive management is on the=
  =01&same=20
 page=018 about where Enron is going---and why.
 
 To accommodate anticipated demand, we currently have two sessions:
 
 Choice: (Please rank in order of preference 1 or 2 for a session below.  Yo=
 u=20
 will attend only one session.)
 
 ______ Thursday, March 29, 2001 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in EB50M
 
 ______ Friday, March 30, 2001 from 2:30 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. in EB50M
 
 
 The Office of the Chairman will host the forum. Here=01,s how it will work:
 ? Each session will have approximately 20 participants.
 ? The format will be honest, open, interactive dialogue.
 ? This will be your forum. Don=01,t expect to simply sit and listen to=20
 presentations.=20
 ? This will not be the place for anonymity. You can safely ask your own=20
 questions and express your own opinions.
 ? You can submit questions/issues in advance or raise them during the forum=
 .
 ? Some examples of topics you might want to discuss include, but are not=20
 limited to: the direction of Enron, business   goals/results, M&A activitie=
 s,=20
 projects/initiatives, culture, leadership, management practices, diversity,=
 =20
 values, etc.
 
 Because the forum will work only if everyone actively participates, we=20
 encourage you to accept this invitation only if you=20
 intend to have something to say and if you are willing to allow others to d=
 o=20
 the same. For planning purposes, it is essential that=20
 you RSVP no later than Friday, March 16, 2001 by return e-mail to Debbie=20
 Nowak, or via fax 713.646.8586. =20
 
 Once we have ensured an even distribution of participants throughout these=
 =20
 sessions, we will confirm with you, in writing,
 as to what session you will attend.  We will try to honor requests for firs=
 t=20
 choices as much as possible. =20
 
 Should you have any questions or concerns, please notify Gerry Gibson by=20

 Thank you.
