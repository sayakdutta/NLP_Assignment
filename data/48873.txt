 Dear Vince,
 
 I would like to confirm the invitation for you to participate at our annual  
 congress in Houston. Following our conversation, I would be most interested 
 in  including a presentation on 'Modeling price volatility in US power  
 markets'  in the pricing, hedging & trading stream on the 14th May,  2001.
 
 I am keen to confirm each speaker and session by the end of next week, which  
 will then allow time to work with each presenter on titles and points that 
 will  provide an accurate summary for the session.
 
 If you have any overall views or suggestions regarding the conference feel  

 extn. 225. I look forward to confirming your participation at  Energy & Power 
 Risk Management 2001. IMPORTANT: Due to system problems I am  using another 
 system. Please do not reply to this email. Please reply to the  address given 
 above.
 
 Yours sincerely,
 
 Paul Bristow
