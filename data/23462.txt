 Rob/Jim -
 
 B&M's affiliate in The Philippines has represented us for years.  They are
 actively engaged in our efforts to sell Batangas and Subic back to The
 Phillipines.
 
 B&M's affiliate in Japan represented Enron in Japan.  Supervision of this
 work is now out of London so I'm not sure of current status.
 
 I believe that one of our Brazil law firms is also a B&M affiliate.  I'm
 copying this to John Novak for more input.
 
 I'll look into any others.
