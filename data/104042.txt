 Sara,
 
 Can we trade with counter-parties in Chile??  We have a strong credit in 
 Chile that wants to purchase an 18 month financial swap for newsprint.  See 
 note below for more in.  Let me know what we need to do...
 
 Thanks.

 The full name of the company is Empresas CMPC based in Chile
 
 web site is www.cmpc.cl 
 
 There might be a problem with the site only being in Spanish, but I know that 
 credit here got S+P data on them.
 
 Sending the Report tonight.
 
 Regards
 
 Darren
