 I heard you've been raising a ruckus about our activities on the price caps 
 -- asking us to do more.  Thanks.  I feel as if I have been a voice in the 
 wilderness for the past six months when I was trying to get people to pay 
 attention to the bad things happening in CA and warning that the problems 
 (mainly a threat of reregulation) will spread elsewhere.
