 delivered a very good speech.   He had the crowd (but for the pie throwin' 
 types) squarely on his side.
 
 Best,

 SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A Texas energy executive got more than boos and jeers 
 before starting a speech on California's energy crisis, he got a pie in the 
 face. 
 Jeffrey Skilling, chief executive of Houston-based Enron Corp., was nailed 
 with a pie by a protester at the beginning of his speech at the Commonwealth 
 Club of California.

 Enron has come under fire after accusations from Gov. Gray Davis and state 
 officials that it and other energy companies forced electricity prices 
 skyward by holding back supply. 
 Enron has denied such claims, and joined other power producers in arguing 
 that the state and utilities owes them billions in unpaid bills. 
 Davis acknowledged that Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which has declared 
 bankruptcy, and Southern California Edison together still owe generators such 
 as Enron, Duke Energy, Mirant and Reliant Energy about $2.5 billion for past 
 electricity sales. 
 State officials countered that wholesalers charged as much as $9 billion in 
 illegal overcharges dating back to May 2000. The feuding groups are to meet 
 in a single room next week under a federal order to try and work out 
 agreements that could determine how billions of dollars will be divided.
