 
 John:  Marie gave me your message.  I will call you after lunch to discuss 
 Total.  The Marval firm in B.A. is ENA's outside legal counsel for 
 derivatives advice.  ENA lawyers hire and speak with ENA's outside counsel.  
 I have spoken with our outside counsel on derivatives issues in Argentina.  I 
 will discuss this further with you when you and I have our conversation.
