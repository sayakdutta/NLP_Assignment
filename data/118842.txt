 
 Just a heads up - Mark H. asked me to set up a day that he and I could come 
 to your office to discuss the legal issues surrounding electronic 
 confirmations of transactions generally but in particular those done over 
 EnronOnline.  I'll check with his assistant and get a couple of potential 
 dates.
