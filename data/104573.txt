 
 Gary is going to provide me with a list of OTC products for priority 
 trading.  He has been in discussions with tax and structuring in Houston for 
 the S. Cone.  The group has considered (i) trading onshore, (ii) trading as a 
 sub of Elektro (and can this be a sub of an offshore entity?) and (iii) 
 trading offshore.  They have studied the CC5 account requirements and have 
 had conversations wtih JP Morgan and BofA.  There appears to be little 
 communication with anyone in Brazil and Joe Kishkill is going to Sao Paulo 
 next week.  I'll be more specific in a day or so.  I'm still having problems 
 tying into the database (this is ridiculous!).  Did you receive my voice 
 mail?  SS 
 
 
     
 
 
 
 Have you been able to get a better handle on what it is that Gary wants to do?
