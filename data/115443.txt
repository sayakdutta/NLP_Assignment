 
 Thanks for checking. I entered this deal today and am still getting used to 
 all the different variations of company names. You're right - it's El Paso 
 Merchant.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate

 Hi Kate!
 I just want to make sure that this is the correct counterparty name.  Usually 
 we trade with El Paso Merchant Energy, L.P.  Is this name entered correctly?
