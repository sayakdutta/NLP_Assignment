 
 Billy,
 
 I like it.  My only suggestion is to put in a statement like - that after all 
 your discussions with business unit head and AAs  we are (changing) improving 
 the program on the suggestions that you all wanted to see.  I think this 
 could help everyone believe they were a part of the changes personally.
 
 Just an idea, I like it very much as it is.
 
 Good luck,
 m
