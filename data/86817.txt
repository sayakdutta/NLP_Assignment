 donation, I'm glad we got it, because we ended up short on the cash collected 
 for the cookies.

 Laura wrote her name on the tissue paper because she forgot a card. Her gift
 was the bath bag with the lip gloss.
 Sorry for the confusion. That's great about the cookie sales. Did Karen
 George tell you that someone gave us a $20.00 donation as well!
 Great job!

 Hi, Elise.  Sorry to bother you, but when Kali was unwrapping her presents
 last night, there were two without cards or tags (probably lost in
 transit!!).  We narrowed it down to Laura and Sofi.  So that we can get the
 thank you notes correct, did Laura give Kali  a Skipper doll or a bath set
 in a blue bag?  Thanks for your help.

 P.S.- We ended up selling 131 boxes at the booth on Saturday.
