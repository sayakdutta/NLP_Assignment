 Steve, I gave this fellow your phone number if he decides to call.  Would you like me to route these somewhere else?  It was all I could think of late last evening.  (I should have already forwarded our phones to voicemail!).

 Ken,
 
 Rosa Lee indicated that e-mail would be a great way to initially communicate
 with you regarding the announcement during the Astros pre-game show that
 your CEO stepped down today.
 
 When you are ready to evaluate your options to staff the position, my CEO
 and I would like to meet with you to discuss Allen Austin Lowe & Powers'
 capabilities to do a thorough retain search for this position.  Two salient
 points are: 1) We have filled 100% of our retained searches, and  2) We
 guarantee our candidates for one year.
 
 Allen Austin Lowe & Powers has done work for Enron in the past and is
 located here in Houston.
 
 I can be reached on my direct line listed below or on my cell at (281)
 923-4563.
 
 Regards,
 
 Mike Gergen
 Allen Austin Lowe & Powers
