 
 Here are the email addresses again.  I'll shoot you off an email before I 
 come over...hopefully, by that time you'll be somewhat settled and have a 
 phone number where you can be reached.  Or, I may just see you at the 
 office.  I have to pay a visit as there are a several people working over 
 there now that I used to work with here (plus, I may try to set up a few 
 interviews).
