 all of the capacity" sentence.  With that clarification, I think we ought to 
 get this posted and the letters out to shippers.  Susan--make it so.  
 Thanks.  df  
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
   
  
 As revised is ok, letter also,  but shouldn't we refer to the fact we didn't 
 get binding bids, since we are way beyond March 2nd?  MK
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
   
  
 Here are my comments--I'd like to take out the stuff about the rate and any 
 implication that we have flexible terms and conditions.  DF
