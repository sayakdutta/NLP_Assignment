 All:  I spoke with Kim this morning and although she is anxious to meet 
 everyone, we decided that it would be more productive to try to schedule a 
 luncheon meeting to discuss current issues related to the confirmation desk.  
 I understand that Joe Hunter, Melissa Murphy and David Dupre will be 
 providing Kim with a list of "issues" and we have been invited to add to that 
 list.
 
 Please send me your list of any confirmation issues that you would like 
 raised with Kim which I will cumulate and forward.
 
 You may ignore the message below.  Thanks.  Sara
