 
 Actually, I'm travelling tomorrow.  If we could do it between 8 and 9:30 AM (PST), that would work.  Otherwise, I'll need to do Wednesday if possible.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
 
  
     
 Mr. Dasovich,
 
 Bob Williams has asked me to schedule a conf. call regarding the November 7 Prehearing Conference.  Are you available tomorrow from 1:00 - 2:00 p.m. CST?  Thanks.
