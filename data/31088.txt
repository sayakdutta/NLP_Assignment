 
 Just a note.  Effective April 1st, we will not have the purchase at St 85 or 
 the PSNC transport.  This is a new contract each month - we are currently 
 shipping 145 dt's.

 Good Afternoon.
 
 Just a heads up so that you may contact Chris Germany.  We have one customer 
 at
 PSNC.  Effective April 1st, CES will no longer be supplying gas to this
 customer as their expires.  I just do not want to have a mix up for April and
 have Chris contract with PSNC for capacity when none will be needed.  I am in
 the process of notifing PSNC.  Just wanted to keep you in the loop and give 
 you
 the option to inform Chris.
