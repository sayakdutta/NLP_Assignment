 Thanks

 See Julie's note below.   We'll want to go ahead and proceed with the Quarter Forecast Meeting even if Danny's not available, right?

 Please note that Danny will returning on November 13th from a business trip (out 11th-13th) and not able to make the 1:30 Quarter Forecast Meeting with Stan.  Note the Management Conference is November 14-16 and the following week is Thanksgiving.  
 
 Please advise if you want to reset the meeting. Thanks.
