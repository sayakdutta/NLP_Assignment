 We would like to make progress as soon as possible on setting up these legall 
 entities, as other tax-driven restructurings are about to be unleashed and 
 getting the operational side of the transfer into a new entity will take the 
 longest to execute.
 shows the step we wish to take.
 I have deliberately not placed ECCL anywhere because it is probably moving 
 around.
 On what basis should we decide whether to create ECHI and ECCI as LLCs or 
 Corporations?
 
 Many thanks,
 Richard
