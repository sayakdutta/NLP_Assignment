 
 Folks:
 
 Here's the final.   I incorporated some comments from Christine and emailed a 
 copy to Aceves.  Jimmie/Dylan let me know if one of you can bring a hard copy 
 to class tomorrow.  If not, he's now got an electronic copy, and I'll drop 
 off a hard copy on Tuesday.  Hope to see you (for at least half the class) 
 tomorrow.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
