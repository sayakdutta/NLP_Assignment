 
 Okay...My itinerary is as follows:  Arriving in San Diego 2:20 am Friday 
 night (I'll need your new address for the cab) and departing Sunday at 6:15 
 pm.  If you just want to leave the key under the mat that would be perfect 
 for me...I'll probably crash immediately anyway.  I am so excited to be 
 coming out there - -  I really need a break from Houston...not to mention 
 work.  The Gas Lamp district Saturday night sounds like fun and I would love 
 to meet your friends.  Also, please don't feel like you have to plan the 
 whole weekend, I have no problem going with the flow.  
 
 See you in a couple of weeks,
 Susan
