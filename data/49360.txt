 Hi, Vince:
 
 We are considering a preliminary list of speakers for Rice/Enron Seminar 
 Series in Finance for Fall 2001 and Spring 2002.? Do you have any persons in 
 mind that you and your group want to include in the list?? Finance faculty 
 will meet to finalize the list later.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Albert
 
 P.S.: Is Ronnie Chahal still around?? She is currently in my Enron 

 an error message indicating a failure of delivering email to her address.
