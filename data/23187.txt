 
 Dave, the memo looks fine to me.  Please send it.  Thank you. Jim
 
  
     
 Jim,
 
 We need to advise the Executive Committee members that the November 2
 meeting is canceled so they can free next Friday up on their calendars.
 
 Shall I send the memo below (after you've added the dates you propose
 and made any other modifications you wish), or would you rather I
 contact them myself and simply tell them to stand by for more
 information?
 
 Thanks.
 
 David

 RE: Our Inaugural Meeting
 
 Due to conflicts in several of our members' schedules, I have determined
 to re-schedule our inaugural meeting from November 2 to a later date. I
 hope this does not greatly inconvenience those of you who have already
 made your plans to attend on the 2nd.
 
 Rather than simply announcing the new date, I'd like to try to find a
 date suitable for all members. Please advise David Winn (

 availability on the following dates for our meeting in Dallas - as we
 originally planned, we will begin with a working lunch at 12:00 p.m.
 followed by drinks and an early dinner afterwards:
 
 a) ____________
 
 b) ____________
 
 c) ____________
 
 d) ____________
 
 After reviewing your responses, we'll promptly schedule our meeting for
 the date most convenient to the greatest number of committee members and
 notify you of the new date.
 
 Please pardon this change in plans. I do think it is important that we
 have a full attendance as we chart our course for our first year, and
 I'm looking forward to getting on with our work.
