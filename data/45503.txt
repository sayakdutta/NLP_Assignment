 
 I just got another call from Sandy Steffen, and she would like, if possible, 
 to resolve any contract issues with have with each of the product groups, so 
 they can be set up to trade by tomorrow.   She also expressed an interest 
 espectially today  in NATURAL GAS.   After talking to her can you let me know 
 under what contract and/or limitations they can trade.  Thanks
 
 It appears she has only heard back from the online team

 Per my conv. w/Sandy Steffen w/the referenced counterparty (ph:  
 734/887--2048, fax: 734/887-2056):
 POWER:  It appears they would like to trade many of the East Coast power 
 contracts.  She isn't sure whether the Purchase and Sale Agreement they have 
 in place with us would cover East Coast power, and whether it would cover 
 firm and non-firm power.  Also, she was wondering whether we trade power 
 transmission (I had no idea, silly me).  Further, even if we have a master in 
 place with them, I don't know whether we would want to transact under it or 
 under a GTC.  My records show they have come thru before through EOL and 
 Legal shut down for power (Credit has them open). 
 EMISSIONS:  They would also like to transact SO2, and want to get a master in 
 place with  us.  I told her I would have one of the emissions lawyers talk to 
 her (they are already open w/Legal & Credit to trade emissions).
 MASTER USER CHANGE:  She already has a password set up with us and would like 
 to change the master user.
