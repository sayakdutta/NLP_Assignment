 Kay/John:
 
 NRG has signed the CA.  I'm planning on sending them the clean drafts of the 
 LLC Agreement and Letter Agreement drafts provided by Carolyn last week.  
 Please let me know if these drafts have been superseded or not.
 
 Also, I understand from Ben that the deal with Coral is scheduled to close on 
 Thursday.  I would like to know on a more definitive basis if this is indeed 
 true.  NRG remains very interested in the equipment.
 
 Please advise.
 Thanks,
 Jim

 Jim-your e-mail to Carolyn Campbell was just forwarded to me.  The changes
 to the confidentiality agreement are ok.
 
 Since Carolyn will be out most of this week, please direct any
 correspondence regarding this matter to me.  Thanks
