 
 What a happy coincidence about the book!  We'll have to share thoughts when 
 we're done reading it.  The New York Times gave it a rave review, which made 
 it so popular it was sold out for quite some time.
 
 I've had to scold our buddy up there in the frozen north.  He's having to 
 work on a master physical/financial netting agreement for a Canadian 
 counterparty and has been calling me to ask basic ISDA questions that were 
 covered in my class.  I told him if you two were paying more attention 
 instead of clowning around so much...oh well, good thing I can't get him with 
 a ruler up in Canada!  
 
 Take care, and I'll look forward to chatting with you...
