 Jeff asked me to let you know that he really appreciates this opportunity, but his time in the office is at such a premium right now due to his heavy travel schedule, it would be difficult at best to work them in.  He has turned down several invitations to join boards because he just can't commit the time.  So, while he is flattered by their interest, if and when Mr. Quackenbush calls we will decline.
 
 It was nice talking to you.  Glad to hear all is well.
 
 Yours faithfully, Sherri ;-)
 
 
 
 

   
  
 
 
 Jeff,
 
 Great to see Enron and you doing so well.  Congratulations on the -belated-
 CEO ship, the blowout first quarter,
 and the recent piece in Bloomberg.
 
 Since we last met Luminant has done a important and impactful work for Enron
 (EES, Enron Networks, Global
 Sourcing, Broadband among others).  The Oasis and the Websource Intranet
 sites are examples of the results of
 this work.  Phillippe recently selected Luminant as one five integrators
 that Enron will use going forward.
 
 David Quackenbush, Luminants COO, has been personally involved in leading
 the work at Enron.  He and
 Jim Corey Luminant's CEO would like to have the opportunity of meeting with
 you, bringing you up to date
 on the work, and inviting you to consider joining the Luminant board.
 
 I am no longer affiliated with Luminant but David asked me to let you know
 of their interest.  He will be
 following up and seeing if there will be an opportunity for you to meet with
 them.
 
 Regards,
 
 Gil Marmol
