 
 I had a VERY long call with the two lawyers.  I would say for the most part 
 that Tiger will reconsider many of our provisions now that the lawyers 
 understand our position.  Big issues:  arbitration (I need an explanation in 
 order to go to our general counsel)
                                           Limitiation of Liability
 
 All else is negotiable.  SS
