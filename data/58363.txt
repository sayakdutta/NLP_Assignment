 on the site to adress gas prices.

 I anticipate that GPG management will be asked at several upcoming industry 
 meetings to comment on the reasons for and implications of rising natural gas 
 prices.  Attached is a  proposed set of talking points for use in Q&A and 
 briefing materials.    Please let me know if you find these message points to 
 be consistent with our general Enron response to pricing inquiries.
