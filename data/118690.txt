 Mark,
 
 Further to our conversation the other day, are you happy for us to change the 
 following in the GTC screen in EnronOnline:
 
 Old:  "(Guest Users will view Generic GTCs which are shown for information 
 purposes only)"
 
 New: "(Guest Users will view sample GTC's which may differ in some respects 
 from execution versions)"
 
 Dave
