 Thank you for your response. I was very happy to hear from you.
 
 I am also taking next week off and will be back to work on December 27th.
 
 Please do call me when you get back. Would very much appreciate the 
 opportunity to have a quick lunch with you, if possible. Hope everything is 
 going well.
 
 Have wonderful Christmas holidays.

     Dear Mr. Kaminski:
 
     How are you doing? I want to find out if we can meet again for a quick 
 lunch.
 
     You might know that in Maharashtra, India there is now a new Chief 
 Minister
     (CEO of the State Government). I am proud to say that he and I are from 
 the same
     town, Latur.
 
     I would really enjoy talking with you again, at your convenience.
 
     I will call you tomorrow to follow up.
 
     Thank you.
 
     Sincerely,
 
     Maruti More
