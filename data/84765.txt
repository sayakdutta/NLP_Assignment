 the rest of the day.  If this is something that has to be sent out today, 
 incorporate these comments in any new version.  Otherwise lets talk about it 
 tommorrow.

 Gerald, (its Sunday and this is what I have)
 
 Davis is going to make some changes that he and Courtney discussed yesterday 
 in addition to some more equipment and project details.  He will likely do 
 that tonight 
 at home so we will send an updated draft in the moring.  
 
 Defining the LLC stuff to them is not going to happen and will be removed 
 from this 
 document before packaging for Eastman.  
 
 The Force Majuere and other sections are going to be difficult to sell to 
 Eastman and
 we are going to need to work on that portion tomorrow.
 
 Have a great day.
