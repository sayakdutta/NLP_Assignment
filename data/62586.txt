 Can you settle this guy down.  As well as always whining about his fake trading account, he wants to accellerate out of real time early.  Tell him to do his time and learn.  Also he wanted to go to Harry's group next which is a mistake. He needs to learn the business not the derivatives.

 hi Kam,
 
 This is Punit. I have received this email from you but have no other earlier than this one. so when u say 'again' i dont understand. i didnt know i was in such a position and tho i tried to work this from home...i was told i wud not be able to do it unless i put in an 'e-request' which i am in the process of doing. Also i think someone else is trading off my account cos i was on leave and not scheduled to come in till 1730 today and to my surprise i find that there were trades on my account!!!
 
 Please look into this closely including the VaR violation thing.
 
 
 Thank you.
 
 
 Punit.
 
 
 P.S : these are the trades that popped up in my account today from nowhere. 
 
  
     
 Punit,
 
 You have exceeded your VaR limit again today.  I will be taking $100,000 from your P&L tonight.  You must decrease your position today.
