 Even if we get bought out, the trading arm will still be going strong.  Gas and Power are the only things that ever made us money.  And you better still be there if I'm coming all the way back to see you!!

 If we are still here that is.  ENE is at $7.36 - mood isn't so good.
 
  
     
 Hey- I'll be working directly for Savita Puthigai.  :)  Should be good and I can't wait to be back home!  (Then we'll go for Chick-fil-a and catch up.)

 Hey girl.  Who are you working for?  You know all my favorite women (except for Judy) work for EnronOnline.
 
  
     
 Hi All-
 
 Just thought I'd let you know that I've accepted a new position within EnronOnline and I'll be moving back to Houston in early December.  Should be fun!  I'm looking forward to seeing you all soon and getting back into the swing of things.  
 
 Hope all is well-
 Angie
