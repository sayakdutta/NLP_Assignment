 John,
 
 I've been approached by a couple of loads in Montana totalling 50-75 MWs.  Zufferli and I did some rough math on the costs of transmission and what our implied offer would be and haven't heard back from the counterparties.  I think that you need more critical mass to make a project work.

 Fed Ex the PPA sales pitch to me.
  
 Also, I read in the newspaper that Montana was tight for power.  I couldn't tell wether they are tight or the price is just high.  Can we sell long term power to a counterparty or two or three in Montana and build a line?
