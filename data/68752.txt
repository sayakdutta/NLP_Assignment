 If you have viewed your benefit elections on eHROnline, then you may of 
 noticed the missing coverage amount for Child Life Insurance.   For Child 
 Life Insurance, you will be able to see the coverage cost of $.42 per pay 
 period.  However, the amount of coverage will reflect $0.00.  
 
 During conversion to SAP, we discovered that there was no dependent child 
 record created, we need immediate action from you
 
 Please respond to this email by Thursday, June 29 by 3:00 p.m. with your 
 child's name, date of birth and social security number.  Once we have entered 
 all dependent data in SAP your amount of coverage will reflect $10,000 per 
 child in eHROnline.
 
 Thank you,
