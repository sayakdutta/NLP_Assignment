 
 meeting up at 8 is fine
 
 i am going to the gym to see how my back is , i still feel something but it is not 
 like before so i will see 
 
 i will call you later
 
 
  
     
 okay- had a meeting this morning with a new prospect and then
 filled out a complaint at the dry cleaners on a shirt they shrunk of mine
 I am going to stop by a going away party for a guy in my group with Kathleen from 6-7
 then my friend Steinum's going away  is at 9pm at State Bar
 So was wondering if we can catch up around 8 and grab a late dinner
 so that we could stop by State bar so I could say goodbye to Steinum
 does that sound groovy with you?? or do you want to come with us at 6 too??
 love
 me
