 
 Can you please coordinate this meeting to ensure it is productive.   We may need an initial screening mtg. to assess whether the tool can help us from a fundamental/trading standpoint.
 
 Thanks.

 As you may already know, PJM created a spin-off company known as PJM Technologies.  Their goal has been to create packaged, turn-key solutions for the creation of ISOs/RTOs.  
 
 Kevin has expressed an interest in acquiring some of their tools to use in our own analyses of LMP markets.  I have been working with Fran Barrett and Stan Kijewski of PJM Technologies to set up a meeting regarding this potential project.  T. Jae has scheduled a meeting for October 3rd here in Houston for PJM Tech to visit and explain the various tools available and help us determine how they might be used to our advantage.
 
 Unfortunately, I have a speaking engagement on the 3rd, and will not be able to attend.  Therefore, I am attaching the brief overview paper below to provide a bit more background for you all.  There is also a more detailed presentation available at www.pjmtech.com.  It requires you have the most current version of Flash in order to work correctly.
 
 If you have any questions, please let me know and I will try to answer them.
