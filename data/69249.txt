 Please fill out the Book admin section and the trading group section for your 
 appropriate books,  and send back to Chris and copy me by the date listed 
 below.  Thanks for your help.  Hopefully this will eliminate the official 
 book macro.  Thanks

 Attached is the updated spreadsheet, which provides the additional 
 information that you requested.  The Region Code for each book and your 
 previous evaluation of the book status' have been included.  I hope this will 
 help your group more easily identify which books are theirs.  As you are 
 aware, Sally considers this a high priority project.  I would appreciate it 
 if you could return this spreadsheet to me by Wednesday, the 14th.  
 
 Please refer to the previous memo about the rules for each field that needs 
 to be updated.  If you have any questions, please call me at x33102.
 
 Thanks for your help on this.
 
 Chris
