 
 Hi Manny & Jack,
 
 Attached is our draft Master Purchase/Sale Agreement for physical natural gas transactions.  Once we get the ISDA signed and executed we can start on this contract.  It would be good to go ahead and get it in place so that when/if we want to do a physical deal, we won't have to worry about paper.
 
 Did we get you everything that you need to go forward with the ISDA?
 
 I will talk to you next week.  Have a good weekend.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kim
