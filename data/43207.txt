 
 I am glad it worked out for you.  It will be interesting to see how things unfold in the days ahead.
 
  
     
 Stan,
 
 I wanted to thank you again for your guidance through my recent organizational changes.  I want you to know that I am in firm support of wherever you carry the flag, no matter what it may say on that flag.  If you need me and my team to take a hill, we'll make it happen.
 
 Others in the group appreciated my staying, as presented in the following notes, but I would not have been in the position to make this decision without your support.
 
 You and the family have a well deserved Happy Thanksgiving.
 
 Appreciatively,
 Steve

 Steve, I hope you are not disappointed, because I am sure I speak for the majority in saying we did not want you to leave us.  Thanks for staying.
 
  
     
 Glad to hear this.  Good move
