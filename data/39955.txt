 The FT has contacted ISDA regarding our contribution to an upcoming article
 they are writing on the emergence of electronic trading. 
 
 ISDA staff will give them regulatory background in US and Europe.  I thought
 it might be worthwhile for them to hear a business/legal perspective as
 well. 
 
 Would you be interested in speaking with the reporter within the next couple
 of days?  Please advise.  Many thanks!
