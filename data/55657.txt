 Mr. Fastow,
 
 I'm writing all of our participants and confirming plans for the upcoming
 corporate finance meetings on May 4-5 here.  As a reminder, you are slated
 to sit on the executive option/equity dilution panel on Saturday
 morning.  Dave Yermack from NYU, the number one expert on this issue, is
 presenting at that session.  (Again, serving as a panelist should require
 little preparation on your behalf.)
 
 Also, you and your wife are welcome to attend the dinner on Friday evening,
 May 4.  It will be held in the Baker Institute across from the business
 school.  Tom Copeland is our speaker - (I think he plans to focus his
 remarks on real options).  Vince Kaminski  has told me he will be at the
 dinner, however his wife is out of town and will not be.
 
 Please call me direct if I can be of any help or assistance.   I look
 forward to seeing you soon.  I've attached a copy of the program along with
 a name rooster of those planning to attend.
 
 
 Dave Ikenberry
