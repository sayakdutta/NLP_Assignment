They will install the equipment for free and charge $24/mo ($14/mo if you sign up for Sprint Long Distance).  Do you have this?  If so, how do you like it?  Did you hear about Jessie?  Anyway, I just wanted to ask you about this.  I have dial-up now and it really sucks, but I'm a tight-wad and didn't want to pay what DSL costs.  Take Care.
