 
 Mike, thanks for your patience.  I have severe laryngitis so I cannot even 
 speak.  I received a copy of the index for the Utah statute to which Deseret 
 is subject.  I'm afraid that I need Utah counsel to answer my questions.  I'm 
 working on that right now.  If you call me, I'll only be able to respond via 
 e-mail.  Sara
