 Michael,
 
 I received today the attached letter from Jonathon Rosenthal of Saybrook
 Capital.
 
 Based on the conversation you and I had yesterday, I think that a proper
 counter proposal would be to meet in LA, organize a credit committee,
 and instruct Saybrook to seek funding from PG&E and SCE.  But, I would
 be interested in hearing your thoughts.
