 Yes, I think it can be done. I am in London
 right now and I shall come back next week Thursday.
 
 Please, give me call about it.

 Vince,
 
 Sounds like there are several Enron people very interested in our
 seminar.  Many thanks for passing the idea around.
 
 Do you think that these groups might provide some sponsorship?  I didn't
 know whether you have already asked them and they are thinking about it or
 whether I need to approach them directly.  I would appreciate any
 suggestions you have.
 
 Regards,
 Hill
