 
 Debbie,
 
 FYI, Sally Beck will be flying up afternoon of Sept. 28.  Please make her 
 reservation for 28th only.  Also, do you have the address of Stone Davis Hall 
 where dinner & presentation will be held?  I need that for her itinerary.  
 And lastly, can you put me on  it easier for me.
 
 Thanks,
 Patti x39106
