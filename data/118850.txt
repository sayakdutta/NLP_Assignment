 We are concerned about the Asian markets tonight and how they
 will react to Brazil. We feel you should consider closing open
 positions before the end of the day in case Asia self destructs tonight.
 
 The U.S. markets have recovered strongly but are still showing signs
 of further weakness. Time to be careful until a new market trend is
 established.
 
 Good Luck
