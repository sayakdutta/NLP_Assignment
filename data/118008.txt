 from the physical power side.  I'll sit down with him today and get him up to 
 speed.

 Do you know anything about this ? Do you think we will be in shape to lanuch 
 these on Monday ?
 
  
     
 We should have the first one out Monday if we can get legal to sign off. 
 Apparently the person handling long descriptions for physical products quit 
 and we have no replacement to look at the descriptions.
