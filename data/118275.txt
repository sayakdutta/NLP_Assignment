 There will be meetings in Houston at Enron to discuss the new draft of the 
 Offering Memo and the To Do Checklist as follows:
 1.  Wednesday, August 25th, 2pm-7pm, in EB2868; and
 2.  Thursday, August 26th, 8AM-10:30AM in EB 27c1, and continuing after 
 10:30AM in EB2868.
 
 The Wednesday afternoon meeting is the MOST CRITICAL because Larry, John 
 Osborne of Skadden, and a few others are only available to meet on Wednesday. 
 Please make every effort to attend.  In addition, please review prior to the 
 meeting not only the revised OM, but also the checklist, a revised version of 
 which will be distributed later today to include Bob Baird's and my addition 
 thoughts.
 
 For those flying in from NYC, when you reach the Enron Building, please have 
 Enron Security call Larry's assistant, Kim Zachery, at 853-1971, who will 
 meet you on the 28th floor.  In her absence, please have Security contact my 
 assistant, Chaundra Woods, at 345-7621.
