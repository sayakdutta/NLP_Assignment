 
 An application called AP Data Viewer.  Accounts payable uses it to retrieve 
 status on document such as invoice payments, wires, payment requests, etc....
 
 I've just spoken to Pam and I think I'm requesting the right thing but using 
 the wrong form.  Will you please reject this so I can start all over?  
 
 Thanks
 Dana
