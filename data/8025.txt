 John,
 
 There has been a fair amount of discussion about this as well as the 
 reporting of drift for the North America businesses.  Both Mike McConnell and 
 Jeff Shankman are opposed to moving the location of drift in the DPR.  I know 
 that North America included US drift in its plan and includes "drift 
 earnings" in its margin.  I believe you do the same in Europe.  Jeff is 
 adamant that we not  move US drift from EGM's section of the DPR and has 
 asked for UK drift to remain, as well.  You may want to call Jeff.  Sally and 
 I will do what ever you guys decide.

 Please deal with this.  Wes, you know what I think and what we've decided 
 on.  Jeff
  
     
 FYI

 I prepare the London Summary and I have been requested by John Sherriff here 
 in London to have changes made to the reporting format of the Executive 
 Viewer report.  John's request and the changes he has asked for are detailed 
 below.  In essence, John would like Enron Europe's 'UK Drift' revenue to be 
 reported under the 'Enron Europe' heading in the Exec Viewer instead of being 
 reported under the 'Global Markets' heading.  If you agree to this change 
 could you advise Chris Abel and Johnny Thibodeux to make the appropriate 
 changes.  If, however,  you would like to discuss the matter further please 
 contact John Sherriff.  
 
 Regards
 
 Michael

 John,
 
 The attached is the format I believe we discussed and agreed with Ted a few 
 days ago. In order that the guys in Houston will make the changes they 
 require your authorisation.
 
 If you can authorise by return then Michael Kass and I will forward it on to 
 the necessary people below.
 
 If you are not happy with the attached please let me know what needs to be 
 changed.
 
 Thanks James

 Changes are required to the reporting format of Enron Europe's P/L in the 
 Executive Viewer .  Below is a list of these changes as well as the person 
 responsible for effecting each change:
 
 Gary Hickerson: The UK Drift book is to be reclassified from the 'Enron 
 Global Markets' heading to the 'Enron Europe' heading; 
 
 Susie Ayala: The Enron Europe (Net Fair Value) Equity Investments book is to 
 reclassified from 'Merchant Summary' to the 'Enron Europe' heading;
 
 Chris Abel: The following changes are to be made to the books reported under 
 the 'Enron Europe' heading:
  - J Block is to be reported as a separate line item;
  - Structured Derivatives UK is to include all other structured derivatives 
 and power/gas accruals (currently reported under 'Other' line item); 
  - For each of the Electricty books, could you change the word Electricity to 
 Power in the headings (for consistency purposes).
