 As soon as we finish calcing our book on Friday, we should be good to go.  We will start as soon as possible.

 With the amount of activity this weekend, our DBA group is facing the prospect of working all night this Friday to meet a Saturday 12:00 noon deadline to begin IT testing of the Estate production environment.
 
 Is there any way we can start the outage at least a few hours earlier on Friday?  Please respond one way or another.
 
 Thanks,  Steve
 
  
     
 
 
  
     
 Good Morning,
 
 To support the Enron Estate / NETCO split, Enpower will be going down this weekend.  Starting at 6:00pm Friday, January 11th, we begin the process of moving databases & renaming them for the two companies.  The application is scheduled to be back online at 6:00pm on Saturday, January 12th.  The application team & any users volunteering for weekend testing will then begin performing some basic test scripts to ensure the applications still work.
 
 Please note that after the change, you will need to change any Excel Spreadsheets or Access Databases that connect to the "PWRPRODN" or "PWRPRODN_DED" database aliases to "ESTPWRPN".
 
 Thanks,  David Poston
