 
 Where are you located?  I'll come by to get them after I go to the credit union.
 
  
     
 I have copies of the Dominion (CNGP) for EES for 11/01, 12/01, 1/02. I have not received any statements for 2/01. The stack is too much to fax.  Would you like for me to send them interoffice?
 
 Thanks
 Patricia
