 
 what is going on?  i figured that you wouldn't be coming to houston due to 
 the weather on saturday.  just let me know if you want to come in and we can 
 hit the town.  i won't be in houston over thanksgiving or the following 
 weekend.  actually, the following weekend i will be in new orleans.  my 
 brother is coming in town and we are staying at my family's place in the 
 quarter.  talk to you soon.
