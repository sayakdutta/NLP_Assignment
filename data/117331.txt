 Hello Mark,
 
 Justin Boyd told me that your can help me with questions regarding Chile.
 We got a request for guest access through MG.
 The company is called Escondida and is a subsidiary of BHP Australia.
 
 Please advise if I can set up a guest account or not.
 F.Y.I.: MG is planning to put a "in w/h Chile" contract for Copper on-line as 
 soon as Enron has done the due diligence for this country.
 Thanks !
 
 
 Best regards
