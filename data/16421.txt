 Can't thank you guys enough for coming.  It was a great time, and Prentice 
 was really happy that you made it.  Hope you didn't get too much of a 
 headache listening to me play (?) the bass.  Please pass along thanks to 
 Lisa, and no reciprocation needed.  Great to have you.  Happy holidays.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
