 
 It was great to see a friendly face!  Don't ever hesitate to wave or stop in 
 and say hello.  Can you believe that I had been on the 30th floor since the 
 summer of 1994?!  I know that sets some kind of record at Enron!!  It is kind 
 of fun to be up here.  The appreciation for the jobs that we do in operations 
 has grown over the last several years, thanks to the hard work of you and so 
 many others.  
 
 My family is doing great.  The children start school tomorrow.  Meagan will 
 be a junior in high school -- we took a brief trip with her this summer for 
 an early look at some colleges.  It will be a big year for Amanda -- she 
 starts junior high in 6th grade.  And Tyler would tell you proudly that he is 
 "two and a half".  What a delight he continues to be!!  
  
 I know that Erin has worked hard.  I hope that she and her husband are doing 
 well.  --Sally

 Sally --
 
 I acted impulsively when I saw you this a.m.  I was so excited to know you 
 were on the 33rd floor where I was picking up United Way shirts that I didn't 
 control my enthusiasm over seeing you.
 
 I apologize if I disrupted you.

 P.S.  I hope your family is doing fine.  Erin graduates in December from 
 UT-Dallas with her masters in Speech Path.  She and her husband are doing 
 very well and very much in love.
