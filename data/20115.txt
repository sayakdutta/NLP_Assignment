 Thanks.  Your attention is appreciated.  I know your swamped and focused on other things.  But these administrative details are important.  It's what keeps the trains running on time ... the electricity flowing through the wires ... it's why you can go into a McDonald's from Poughkeepsie to Pitsburgh and the Big Macs taste the same ... .  
 
  
     
 Here are my additions.  Tried to turn around quickly, so I apologize in advance for errors. My adds are in yellow.  If anyone has questions, don't hesitate to let me know.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Once again, I've had my inadequacies pointed out and highlighted for all.  
 
  
     
 Did anyone else get the attachment?  If not, Paul, could you resend?  Thanks.
 
  
     
 Attached is the strawman.  Note that the Sheet 2--drops participation to bare essentials.  Sheet 3 assumes a 40% budget cut from Sheet 1.   The deleted actions are different in Sheet 2 and Sheet 3.  
 
 Jeff:  Please review ASAP, add the gas matters to Sheet 1, delete gas matters that are not essential in Sheet 2, and take a 40% haircut in Sheet 3.  Also add back any other matters that I have deleted that you disagree with, but make sure that Sheet 3 continues to meet the 40% haircut target.  Then send to Sue Mara for review.  
 
 Sue:  Please review ASAP after Jeff.  I need to get this into Rick by Wednesday.  
 
 Alan:  Please take a look and pass any comments along to me.
