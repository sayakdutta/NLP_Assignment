 inaccuracies we cannot live with.  I'm assuming the rest of the group will 
 react similarly and Norm will be stuck filing his own exhibit.  Your thoughts?

      Your proposed draft exhibit goes substantially beyond the ALJ's order.
 ALJ Biren specifically stated that the the late-filed exhibit "should be
 narrowly focused on the mismatch of capacity." Tr. 1021.Thus, you need to
 eliminate the column entitled "Total Take-away Capacity."  Furthermore, the
 column is both suspect (e.g., the representation that EOR is 770 MMcfd) and
 misleading (e.g., the inclusion of SWG or PG&E in "S. Calif Take-away
 Capacity").  Also, you need to eliminate the "Avg. Daily Market" box.  The
 following is what should be submitted to ALJ Biren:
 (See attached file: #1070989 v1 - FIRM PIPELINE CAPACITY DELIVERY (EX. TO
 I.99-07-003).doc)
