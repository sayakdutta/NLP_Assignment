 Hi Friends!
 
 The big Rice-ALP final presentation day is almost here:  MONDAY, May 7th,   4pm,    at Enron, 1400 Smith.  Please come to the Enron Lobby and ask for me or my assistant, Melinda McCarty.
 
 After the presentation, you are cordially invited to dinner and an Astro's game (vs Phillies)  at the Enron Box at Enron Field.  As participation in the Enron Box at Enron Field is limited to this special invitation list only, please confirm your attendance via return eMail, or via voice mail to me at 713-853-6117 ASAP.
 
 We're very excited about the work the Rice ALP team has done and we're all greatly looking forward to the presentation.
 
 Hope to see everyone Monday!!
 
 Best regards!
 
 --Christie.
