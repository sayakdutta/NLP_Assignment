 Dear all,
 
 Firstly, apologies for the delay in finalising this study; a considerable 
 amount of data analysis was required.  The idea is to aggregate monthly, 
 weekly and daily volatilities such that we can price individual options on 
 half hours into the future.  We have a reliable methodology for the monthly 
 vol curve at the EFA slot level.  The first issue to address was to use a 
 "reverse basvol" to estimate the monthly vol curve at the half-hourly level 
 of detail.  This required an estimation of half-hourly price return 
 correlations.  This resulted in a scaling factor of approximately 1.30 that 
 is applied to all EFA vols to convert to half-hourly (the scaling factors are 
 slightly different by EFA slot, but not by nearly as much as might be 
 expected). 
 
 For the weekly and hourly half hourly vols, a historical analysis was carried 
 out on the past few years data; a weighting-scheme was applied to add more 
 emphasis to standard deviations calculated on more recent data.  
 
 COMBINING THE VOLATILITIES
 The idea is to let the monthly vol curve get us to the start of the month and 
 then assume that all half hours are positioned at 2 weeks and 3 days into the 
 next month.  The volatility is aggregated using these time-weightings to 
 ensure that we don't have a wildly different volatility for the options at 
 the start of a month and at the end of a month.  Below is an example for half 
 hour #38:
 
 I put the spreadsheet HalfHourlyVolModel.xls into the public directory, 
 S:\RESEARCH\ANJAM\HHOPTIONVOLMODEL\. I suggest we use the matrix of forward 
 volatilities on the summary page and see what kind of numbers we get.  There 
 may need to be some fine-tuning of the time-weightings, but in general, I 
 believe we can start utilising these semi-final numbers.
 
 Regards,
