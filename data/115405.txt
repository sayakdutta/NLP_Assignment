 sorry - confusion - tom alonso had the williams deal with APB down as a 
 purchase, but he's changing it to a sale just in the interest of checking out 
 now. Deal # is 534492

 do you know the williams deal number?
 
 
 
 

 
   
  
 Yes - it's a Puget deal. I'm trying to contact Sean right now to see if he 
 and Diana overlapped on these deals. I only see them written once in his 
 trade log, but I'm auditing the second two to find out who entered them.

 534497 is a pudget deal?
 
 
 
 

 
   
  
 Verified with Diana and Sean - these should be APB.
 
 and the Williams deal should be resolved - deal # is 534497

 apb does not recognize, these may be duplicated deals that are already in the 
 system.
