 I thought I would drop you a quick note.  How are things going?  I hope your still getting lots of deals done and knocking them deal at Enron Direct.  I decided I would take a look at the Stampeder's stats before I dropped you the line.  It looks like things are getting a little better (other than turnovers).  Good luck tonight.........there is no one I hate more than the Saskatchewan Roughriders.
 
 Regards,
 
 Jon
