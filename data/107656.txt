 Dear Mr. Shankman,
      Thank you very much for your quick reply.  Attached is my resume.  I
 highlight the relevant skills in the summary.  The position is with the EES
 MMC EAST department / WHOLESALE, RETAIL & COMM, ENRON ENERGY SERVICES. It was
 posted on Dec. 11, but the Human Resource dept said that if it is still on
 the internet, it is open.
      Look forward to hearing your comments / suggestions.
 Regards,
 Rina
