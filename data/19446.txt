 
 Hey.  Work prevented me from going to class at all last nite.  Does the course seem like it will be good?  Were there a million people there?  Chances are very low that I'll get in, but I'm gonna try anyway.  I'm on vacation next week (yeah), but maybe we can catch during the break on the following Tuesday or Wednesday.  Good to see you the other night.  Take care.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
 
  
     
 Hey there!
 
 How are you?  How's your summer? I'm nearing the end
 of summer school and cannot wait til it's over. The
 class has been a new low point in terms of educational
 value-it sucks! ...in fact, I'm in class now.
 
 Work is fine-not thrilling.  Again-I'm thinking about
 taking advantage of Sun's flexible work deal and
 moving back up to the city. I do not like the south
 bay much.
 
 Trying to get a happy hour together in August...are
 you around?
 
 Let me know how you are...
 Courtney
