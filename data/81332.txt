 Thanks for all you help!
 
  
     
 Jon,
 
 I submitted an e-request for your access to O:\TDS.  You should see an e-mail once access has been granted.

 Kam,
 
 Could you please grant me access to the O:\TDS directory so that I can load curves in Brad McKay's absence, as well as set my own in the future.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Jon
