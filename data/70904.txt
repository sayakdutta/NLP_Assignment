 Michael's class party is tomorrow at 2:15 followed at 3:15 by the gym class
 party.
 
 Next Wednesday school is out at 11:30 and he should be picked up in the car
 pool line. The Children's Center is open until 6pm that day if needed.
 
 Thanks for taking care of me last night and this morning.
 
 Love, Neil
 
 I forgot to write a check for the Astros tickets last night. Do you want to
 write it and get it over to John?  Twenty games would be $2,377.20.
