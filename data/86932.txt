 I don't think anything has changed.  The transport rate is $.2421 + 0.3% fuel.  The pricing is the average + $.01.  I've emailed Tricia to see what the problem is.

 Susan,
 
 We have received our statement for September and the price has changed from
 our original contract and what we have previously been paid.  The statement
 shows that we are being paid three different amounts for various volumes,
 rather than the average of the three prices plus $.01.  I have spoken with
 Tricia Truong and she suggest I speak to you.
 
 Also the transportation has changed on the statement.  Has this changed?
 
 Is something in error or has the contract changed?
 
 Thank you,
 
 Stevens
