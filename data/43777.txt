 thanks again,
 kh
 
 

    
 
 
 Kevin, we have not yet had the opportunity to meet as I have not been able to
 make it to the Committee meetings as Carrie had set-up. Taking a look at the
 Agenda, I can probably help with items 5 or 6 and would be happy to develop and
 deliver a presentation or would ensure that a senior representative from
 Enbridge would do that. My natural tendency (with my current position in
 Northern Pipeline Development) would be towards the Agenda Item No. 5 (New
 Supply  Sources), but I probably could find a good resource within Enbridge to
 present some views and thinking on the Infrastructure De-bottlenecking item.
 
 Please let me know what you think............ wayne
 
 I look forward to the Conference and to getting a chance to meet you.

 Hi everyone!!
 
            For those of you I haven't met personnally, my name is Kevin
 Hyatt.  I am currently chairing the Natural Gas Infrastructure
 subcommittee for the Electric Power Conference 2002 to be held in March.
 You are receiving this email because you have previously expressed an
 interest in serving on the committee.
 
 Attached below is the current subcommittee track agenda with the 4
 sessions and each session's speaking topics.  The track and topics were
 developed over the last 3 months with various inputs from committee
 members and the Trade Fair Group staff.
 
 Our current challenge is finding speakers for items 1, 6, and 15
 (highlighted in red).  If you move your cursor over the topic, the
 comment box will appear outlining in a little better detail what info we
 are trying to present for the conference attendees.
 
 I am working on lining up several speakers but as of yet have only
 confirmed one from Calpine.  What I need each of you to do is review the
 agenda, think about who you may know who would be a good speaker for the
 topic, then call them to see if they are interested.  Speeches should
 last no more than 30 minutes with a Q&A period afterward.
 
 If possible, please email or call me with your results by Friday 10/26.
 Interested speakers will receive a formal invitation from the Trade Fair
 Group confirming their attendance.
 
 Thanks for your help.  Don't hesitate to call me (713-853-5559) or
 Carrie Shapiro (713-463-9595 x307) with any questions!!
