 Sure.  I guess you didn't get my email about getting a table.  Well, I now have a phone, and hopefully you'll have one soon.  Let's definitely shoot for Thursday.  I may take Friday off if I get everything done this week.
 
 Sorry too!
 
 What do you think about Stacy's news????
 
  
     
 I am so sorry,  a lesson on communication.  I called and left a message and waited by the elevators.  Lets try for Thurs or Fri?  
 
  
     
 Hey, lady,
 
 I just got back from eating on 2.  I grabbed a table and looked for you the entire time, but didn't see you.  Then I got your message.  Where were you?
 
 Let's try it again soon.
