 We want to hear from you!  The eThink Team is asking each Enron employee to 
 submit one "Dream eSpeaker" suggestion for consideration to host an eSpeak 
 session.
 
 Is there someone outside of Enron that you feel would have a valid audience 
 inside Enron?  Or, is there someone at Enron you think we have overlooked 
 thus far?
