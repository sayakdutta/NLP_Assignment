                                       Powerful forces are at work to 
 challenge you on a new level of association.
                                       Travel may be part of the new game 
 plan. Investigate the possibility of a move
                                       to a new locale. You might consider a 
 home away from home as well. This is
                                       the time to express a latent talent or 
 learn a new technique in relation to
                                       investments. You may have to work out 
 some conflicts in a relationship,
                                       however. Don't let hurt feelings 
 prevent you from making a new start.
