 now?  For how long?  Thru the Legal Conference?  I would be happy to help in 
 whatever way I can.  As you know, we've recently revised our forms, so this 
 would be a good time to get him indoctrinated.
 
 I will, of course, be sad to have you leave us.  You have been wonderful to 
 work with from both a personal and professional standpoin.  Your baby's gain 
 in your time is a loss to Enron, because are a most valued asset to our 
 company.  I hope our lives will cross again some time!  Best wishes for your 
 future, you deserve the best!
