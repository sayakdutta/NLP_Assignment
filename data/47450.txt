 Sam & Stephanie,
 
 Re:  Cargill Ferrous International
 
 It was my understanding with the EOL Team that all divisions would have the 
 legal incorporated entity as part of the name.  Stephanie, I my preference is 
 to kick their Password Application back and get them to change it to read 
 something like "Cargill Ferrous International, a division of Cargill, Inc."  
 or "Cargill, Inc. acting through its Cargill Ferrous International Division".
