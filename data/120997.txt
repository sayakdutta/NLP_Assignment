 The confirmation group will resend the confirms and it does look like we will need you guys to sign them and fax them back to us.  Our fax number is listed below.  Let me know if you need anything else.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kim

 Sure, we can refax the confirmations - Richard, please take care of this. 
 
 Yes, we should get them to sign and fax them back to us - our fax number is 713-646-4816.

 Ellen,
 
 Palo Alto asked me to refax the confirms that we recently sent because they had problems with their fax machine.  Also, do we need to have them sign the confirms and send them back to us?  If so, I need to l let them know.
 
 thanks for your help,
 
 Kim
