 Hi Debra;
 Attached are documents for your review regarding Aquila's request of Enron
 to amend our current Gas contract to replace/assign the UtiliCorp
 responsibilities to Aquila, Inc.
 I have sent along for your review, the supporting documentation from both
 Moody's and S&P regarding the Aquila credit rating, the Secretary of State
 filing/order showing Aquila's name change, our underlying contract and a
 proposed amendment for your review/execution.
 
 It appears that this amendment is necessary because there has been a delay
 in the execution of a new contract which would have removed UtiliCorp as a
 party.
 
 Because of the Aquila spin off, we are under a significant time constraint
 to remove UCU from all Aquila contracts.
 
 If you have any questions regarding this, please do not hesitate to contact
 me.
