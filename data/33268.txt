 
 I don't know how this asset management deal works on demand charges.  Could you give me a demand charge report out of Unify please?
 
 
  
     
 The spreadsheet for Nov. does not have any demand expense listed for Tetco. The Service P/L report shows demand cost on contracts 895829 and 895835, deal numbers 1146868 and 1146936.
 
 Do you need to update spreadsheet?
 
 Thanks,
 BF
