 FYI, Clay and I are regular participants in these calls.  I will update both 
 of you from time to time by voicemail as important events occur

 We will continue to have a daily Dabhol Task Force Call primarily aimed to 
 update the working group team with participation by senior management as they 
 deem appropriate. All of you are invited to participate. You may find that 
 until major events occur, participating everyday is not useful. Thus, when 
 major updates occur, we will send a separate e-mail requesting that all be on 
 the phone call. However, all team members working directly on this project 
 are expected to attend everyday.
 
 On Wednesday, January 10, we will be discussing outcome of lender meetings in 
 New York. 
 
 To assist the India team with finishing our daily meetings and returning back 
 to the office or perhaps even allowing time for people to get home before the 
 call begins, I am changing the time of the ongoing calls, starting Wednesday, 
 January 10, to 8:30pm India, 9:00am Houston.
 
 If there are others to be added to the distribution list for this call, 
 please communicate directly with Mrudula Gadade via e-mail.
 
 The dial-in details remain the same:
