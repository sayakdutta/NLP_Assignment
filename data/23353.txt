 I know that it is impossible to get you on the phone. I have left a couple of messages. I just thought I would let you know how much I feel for you and all of the good Enron folks. You all are in our thoughts and prayers. It does not seem possible that Houston's flagship company and premier corporate citizen could get struck by lightning. If it happens to you all, it could happen to anybody. I have been following the situation daily because I have been representing Tyco in a revision of their existing contract with EESO. It has not been pretty.
 
 As you know, I have twice volunteered our firm's assistance to Enron in anyway we could be of help. I took the lack of response to mean you had all the help you needed. We have been approached by a couple of clients to advise them and to represent them if there appears no solution to Enron's problems short of protection of the bankruptcy court. Do you have an objection to our representation of them? I will assume that you have none if I do not hear from you to the contrary.
