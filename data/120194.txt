 Hoon,
 I just looked at the Bernhardt website and I didn't see the style we want, but
 they had on the catalog at the Noel store.
 
 the style is CATALINA - two love seats and a wage (the middle part) and it comes
 w/ 4 pillows
 the fabric is FLAIR - on the sofa the code is 7063-010
                  - on two pillows the code is 7143-032
                  - on two pillows the code is 7132-002
 
 Noel's price - $5228 with delivery included
 
 I would like two or three more pillows, depending  on the additional cost.
 
 
 Let me know what Louis Shanks and the other place  says about it!
 
 Love
 me
