 Do you know who is commenting on the Enron reps and warranties mentioned in 
 the cover memo either from your side or our side?  Also, Mark Evans is 
 calling me tomorrow at 10 to go over the "New" structure.  Let me know if you 
 want to be plugged in.  I'm not sure if the swap docs are affected.
