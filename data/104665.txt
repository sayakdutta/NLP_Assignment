 
 Sharon & Susan:  We will send blackline shortly.  With respect to your fax of 
 11/10/00, please note the following:
 
 1.  continuing guaranty is fine
 2.  Rider A will require further discussion and is not acceptable
 3.  30 days is too long and not justifiable but we are agreeable to extend 
 time to  10 Business Days
 4.  Replacement credit support is not acceptable
 
 If you still wish to pursue unacceptable items, please advise and I will try 
 to  arrange a call for you and the Enron Corp. lawyer, Clement Abrams, who is 
 currently out of town.  He returns tomorrow.  
 
 Thanks.  Sara
