 Scott ,
  
 Here is the email that I sent to John Hodge yesterday.  It has the  conf. letter with blanks to be filled in as an attachment.  One attachment  is in Word Perfect 9 format and the other is in wordpad format in case you have  trouble opening the WP version.
  
 Thanks in advance for your prompt response.
