 The purpose of the account is to buy 0.5% of TGS shares.  By buying those 
 shares, Enron will be able to utilize NOLs that are currently trapped in 
 CIESA, the parent company of TGS.  Jeff Kinneman's group will handle actual 
 market execution.  Glenn, please forward to Ted and Sara a  copy of the 
 signed DASH.
 
 Regards,  Bruce
