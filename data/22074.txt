 
 Mike, duly noted; however, there will be at this point no change in the scope 
 and function of Redmond's group.
 
 Thanks

    Role?
 
 Dave,
 
 Congratulations on an apparently expanded role.  I know you have a lot more 
 important issues to deal with at the moment, but will the Enron Americas 
 organization result in a change in the role of the technical group and 
 resource requirements?   When you have a chance to discuss the implications 
 (if any) it might be worth discussing.
 
 Also, on a personal note, if there are new roles associated with the Enron 
 Americas org for which I might be qualified, I'd certainly be interested in 
 any new opportunities that come about.
 
 Thanks!
 
 Mike
