 The new Las Vegas Pool product will bridge into sitara as -
 Pipe: Kern River Gas Transmission
 Zone: Las Vegas
 Facility: UNA - Las Vegas
 
 It is buyer's choice; the pool consists of -
 Harry Allen (2-4015)
 Apex (2-4002)
 Blue Diamond (2-4016)
 Pecos (2-4013)
 Lone Mountain (2-4012)
 
 Pecos and Lone Mountain do not seem to be options when manually booking
 a deal in sitara. If they are not in the system they probably need to be set up.
 
 The meters will be determined before 10:30 during scheduling. The deals will
 bridge with the UNA - Las Vegas meter/facility.
 
 Let me know what you think.
 Thanks,
 Jason
