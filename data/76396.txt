 there.  I know New Orleans has deals that time of year.  There is also 
 Guadalupe River Ranch, and some decent B & B's in Galveston.
 
 
 
 
 
 


   
  
 They do not have anything for the 29-30th. She said there was something in
 her reservation book she wanted to check out but it didn't look good. I
 asked about other dates and she said nothing back to back. She will e-mail
 me later today or Monday with more info. You mentioned New Orleans. How
 about New York if we have to fly? We also talked about London after the
 first of the year. The 30th is very close to the first...NM
