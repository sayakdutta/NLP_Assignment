 Results of Monday meeting:
 1)  Marion will continue to maintain a spreadsheet of outstanding shipper receivables for reservation, commodity and cash in/out balances.
 2)  Marion will supply John K & Sally with an estimate on Friday for the upcoming week of expected cash flow based on the history of cash received (using Jerry's existing spreadsheet) and maintaining an ongoing daily cash receipts balance (at a high level).
 3)  Reviewing whether the invoice due date can be moved up to follow tariff, ie, net 10 days falls on Sunday, can  invoice due date be on Friday (9th) prior to Sunday (11th).
 4)  Jerry S will follow up with the SAP IT team to automate his report after reviewing report requirements with John K, Rick & myself.
 5)  MS Reps will follow up with customers sending cash in to Enron office rather than lockbox or by wire.
  
 We plan to give this a try for a month.  If problem arise, we will reconsider the decisions.
