 
 I am a proud papa!  She's so cute too!
 
 What are you doing in CT?  I thougt you were in  CA?
 
 Things are going ok for me.  Me and my "Woman" (we are not married - yet) are living in an apartment near Kirby and Westheimer.  I'm tired all the time anymore - not from staying up with the baby, that's woman's work.  I'm reading a Tom Clancy book and I can't put it down.
 
  
     
 
 Congrats on the new baby! You must be a very proud papa!
  
 Hope all is well with you. Drop me a line when you get a free moment.
