 Michelle,
 
 I'm faxing you a letter I received this morning from attorney's representing Thomas Gramlich.
 
 To refresh your memory, Tom was the chap that resigned in May but had a 6 months notice period in his MG employment letter.  He was the head sales person in our Lead Trading Group and given that he is going to work for a competitor, we wanted to use all of his notice period to keep him out of the market for as long as possible until we could find a suitable replacement.  September 26 would be the end of his notice period and his attorneys are proposing a June 30th release date.
 
 As notice periods are not enforceable in the US, our hands may be tied, but I wanted to keep you advised.  Please let me know if you think there is anything we can do.
 
 
 Thanks
