 
 Attached please find referenced list.  The only amended counterparty with a 
 change was Murphy Exploration which was shut down for power.  I wonder, when 
 we are working with amended counterparties, if there is some way that my 
 prior approval could be on the recent spread sheet?  Right now I have to go 
 find the old spread sheet to find out what I approved it for last time to see 
 if I have any problem with the change.  So usually, unless I have - change 
 next to amended, it means I had no change to what I said before.  Does that 
 make sens?
