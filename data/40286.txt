 
 Your ideas about decertifying the Cal ISO are very interesting but I question 
 your likelihood of success given FERC's lack of political will (thanks to 
 George W.'s new leadership ) to sue the ISO to get rid of the newly-appointed 
 ISO board.

 Hi Mary,
 
 Here's the situation as I see it:
 
 DSTAR does indeed still have the bad governance problem to which you
 alluded. On the other hand, it's turned out that the independent
 Governing Board members have (except in a few cases) been pretty
 reasonable and pro-markets.  So on the key issue of governance, what I
 think we need to do is get DSTAR filed, and then protest at FERC that
 the Advisory Committee is fatally flawed (by definition, it will always
 be 10 incumbents vs. 2 non-incumbents, with 2 more
 likely-to-side-with-incumbents) - so FERC should order the Bylaws
 regarding the Advisory Committee to be changed to something more
 equitable - e.g., what we have in RTOWest.
 
 But aside from the governance, there are a lot of good things about
 DSTAR (which have resulted from our pushback at the Board since the
 fall).  recall that the two key flaws of RTOWest are that (i) FTRs are
 all preallocated to incumbents with no obligation to bring them to
 market; and (2) RTOWest would not have jurisdiction over all FERC
 services and associated facilities.  On both of these issues, we are
 much better off in DSTAR.  In DSTAR, FTR auction REVENUES, not FTRs, are
 being preallocated - so we've won in DSTAR on this important issue.  And
 as to scope of jurisdiction, while the jury is still out (we don't know
 what the PTOs are going to do), the counsel to the Board is basically in
 agreement with our position.
 
 In most other ways, DSTAR and RTOWest are pretty much the same (the
 result of Enron's sponsorship of my work and Tom Delaney's advocacy of
 the Enron physical rights model over the years).
 
 There are still a number of important DSTAR issues to be resolved... but
 overall, we stand to win on most of them.
 
 So: the advantages of pushing FERC to decertify the CAISO and require
 the CA IOUs to join DSTAR (or else lose their market-based rate
 authority for themselves and their subsidiaries)are: (1) DSTAR+CA could
 be up and running within 12 months; (2) FERC doesn't have to get into
 pitched battle with CA over the CAISO governance issues.  It simply gets
 rid of the CAISO, and with it, the xenophobic control over the ISO by
 the state of California; (3)DSTAR - which plans to file its Tariff in
 March/April, becomes a model for RTOWest.
