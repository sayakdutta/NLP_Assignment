 I am sending you this note to let you know that my email address has
 changed. I have been having trouble receiving emails from different
 individuals and have been unable to correct it, so I created a new address.
 If you could please now address all emails to me at
 

 
 I would greatly appreciate it.
 
 Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you.
