 
 But Rory (who by the way is responsible for this mess!) now has decided that 
 he'd like to do a Xmas "make up" on the 29th, which is smack dab in the 
 middle of when we'll be up at the dome (tween xmas and new year's--hopefully 
 you and eldon will join us so we can kick yer butts in spades).  so the 29th 
 is very bad, as you can imagine.  if we could do the 24th, that would be 
 great.  when's your plane leave on the 24th?
