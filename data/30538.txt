 I have categorized the the following O&M categories for the entity income statement as follows:
 					Cost Element						
 Employee Expenses			52002500
 					52003000
 					52003500
 					52002000
 					52004000
 					52004500
 
 Outside Services			52507400
 					52507500
 					52508000
 					52507000
 
 Technology Expense			52502000	
 					52504500		
 
 Also, NNG and TW IT both have non-payroll capital, which I am going to net against "Other Operating Expenses".  Please let me know if you agree with this.			
 
 Thanks,
