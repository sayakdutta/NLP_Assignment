 working on a different deal on an impossible schedule. You know the drill.
 
 Bart is a Washington & Lee guy.  He is older than Ned, so he didn't go to 
 school with him.  Just a little trivia...

 I haven't heard from Barton-have you?
 
 
     
 
 Spalding, Spradling, whatever.  I know it isn't Houston stuff (yet)...

 I've worked with Kilpatrick Stockton's North Carolina office quite a bit,
 mostly regulatory- they are so so.  It is my understanding that the Atlanta
 office messed up a simple thing for Lisa, and that's all I know about them.
 I've worked extensively with King & Spalding, both their Houston office
 (multiple matters) and Atlanta (two matters), and have had good results.
 I've always worked through John Keffer in Houston, who then hooked me up
 with the right folks in Atlanta.

 The Georgia sites have slid down hill and reached the bottom. I have to
 consult with local counsel re groundwater issues. I understand the options
 are King & Spaulding and Kilpatrick & Stockton. I've worked with neither.
 Can you evaluate/recommend either?
