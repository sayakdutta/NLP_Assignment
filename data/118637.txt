 
 Sorry for the delay - our general policy is (and the first response to this 
 type of question should be) that , due to system requirements, it is not 
 possible to provide for different online contracts for different 
 counterparties.  Having said that, in the few cases where a counterparty has 
 raised what we consider to be valid and material concerns, we have agreed to 
 a side letter agreement with that particular counterparty to vary the terms 
 of the ETA.  So if the counterparty resist the first response and threatens 
 to not use the system for legal reasons, you should refer them to the legal 
 department.  They can contact either Carol St. Clair (x33989) or me (x37459).

 Hello Mark, 
 Please advise me on this matter and let me know if you want me to follow up 
 with the customer or if you contact customer.  EOL customer is inquiring 
 about if their Lawyers can modify or  make comments to the ETA. Thanks.
