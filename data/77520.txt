 
 Hi Gerry,
 
 Enron is a great place for an engineer to work in a non-technical position.  
 In fact, I work with reformed engineers daily, in various capacities.  
 
 Enron has an analyst program for college graduates, where the analysts go 
 through six month rotations in various parts of the business. In addition, 
 there is a good job search feature on Enron's website.  If you see something 
 that looks promising, I'll check things out around here to see if I can get 
 the inside scoop.  
 
 FYI, Enron North America, Enron Broadband, and Enron Energy Services are good 
 choices.  ENA is the old Enron Capital & Trade, so it is the real heart of 
 Enron (yes, it is where I now work).  Enron is also focusing on industrial 
 development (paper, steel, and who knows what else). I don't suggest EECC. 
 
 Hope to see you soon,
 
 Kay
