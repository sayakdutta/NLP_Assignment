 Good question. I am not sure what the copyright regulations are in regards
 to that website. I know we have full access to Enron's BRM course content -
 you can copy/paste straight from there.
 
 I will ask Kirk McDaniels about the Nymex website first thing tomorrow
 morning and get back to you.
 
 Have a good night.
