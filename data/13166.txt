 Hi Michelle.  I am so sorry that i was unable to chat with you at last week's 
 meeting with David.  I have a question regarding photos on the MD/VP 
 biographic profiles (which will be provided at the VP/MD Global meetings on 
 31 July and 1 Aug. 
 
  I am told that insofar as possible we should ensure photos are included on 
 all the bio profiles-- but I also understand that there are legal 
 considerations (i.e. we need to get employee concurrence to include the 
 pictures).
 
 I gather that there is a disclaimer or consent form that the VP's and MD's 
 will have to sign and wondered if you would have a copy of this consent form 
 for me to use.  
 Any info you can provide on this would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks in 
 advance.
 
  Gina
