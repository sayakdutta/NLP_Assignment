 Any thoughts on this one?  --Sally

 Eric Le Dain is renegotiating the Petro Canada contract and has a question 
 with regard to costs.  Canada is allocated a portion of your groups costs via 
 the service agreement and we are trying to determine what portion would be 
 applicable to PetroCanada.  Can you provide me with the name of an individual 
 in your group with whom I could discuss this allocation.  I'm going to have 
 to provide Eric with an answer by early next week.  Thanks for your 
 assistance.
