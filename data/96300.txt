 Elizabeth,
 
 I work for Georganne and we are trying to find all the pieces in the risk 
 books.  It would be very helpful if we could get the appendices that are 
 mentioned in the document below.  Could you help me with this?
 
 thanks

 Can you please forward a copy of the letter we sent out Tuesday morning to 
 Georgeanne Hodges so that she has all of the correct values?  Thanks.
