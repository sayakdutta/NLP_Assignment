 the burden of proof rests on your shoulders
 
  
     
 They were a gift.
 
 
     
 
 i'll just need a receipt and you're done
 
     
                 
    Sure.  The original cost was $100.
 
    
                 
 
    you're done on the 85% discount ?
 
        
                             
       We should be done then.

          What size are your shoes?
 
          
                                         
 
          i'd have to see them and they'd have to fit my shoes, but as long
    as
       the
          discount is in the 85-90% range,
          i'm cool with it.
 
              
                                                    Subject:
 
             I have a pair of shoe trees that are slightly too big for my
       shoes.
          Do
             you
             want a look.  I'd give them to you, but I need a pair myself,
    and
       I'm
             cheap.
             I suggest some sort of sale whereby we both win.  I sell you
    the
       new
             shoe
             trees for a discount (you win) and I use that money to finance
    my
             purchase
             (in turn receiving a discount on that pair).  What do you say
       bitch?
