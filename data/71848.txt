 I was off work yesterday, so I just got your email.  You gotta love 
 President's Day.  We went to the rodeo last night, and I'm really tired 
 today.  I'm too old to go out on a school night!
 
 Mom said that the dr wants to do a sonogram on Dad's neck to check out the 
 blockage.  When I talked to her they didn't know when it would be scheduled.  
 Evidently there is some unclogging procedure they can do.  Sounds dangerous 
 to me, but I don't really know anything about it.
 
 Too bad about Katie's asthma.  I was worried that Paige has it, but she went 
 through a bunch of tests and they said she doesn't have it.  Just really bad 
 allergies that make her wheeze.  I'm not sure of the difference, but I 
 believe this dr.
 
 Michael still isn't interested in playing team sports.  We asked this spring 
 and he said not yet.  I don't know why he doesn't want to play, but I don't 
 want to push him either.  Maybe I should take him to watch some little kids 
 play.  Maybe we can come watch Annie play.
 
 Neil's rodeo stuff will be over next week. Everything else is business as 
 usual around here.  
 
 Say "hey" to everyone.
 
 Love,
 
 Kay
