 
 I hope you are enjoying your time in Barcelona.  A couple of requests:
 
 Could you give the name of your colleague at hbs who's research you presented at the last Enron Advisory Council meeting?
 We are organizing our annual management conference and I would like to bounce some ideas off of you and ask for some recommendations for speakers.  Call when you get a chance. 713.853.1586.
 
 Thanks.
