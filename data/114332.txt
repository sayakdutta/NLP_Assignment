 Glenn-
 
 I really have no interest in Lewis River or Klamath since there is zero correlation to the Columbia flows....  However, I'll offer the whole deal at $3 million per year with the hair if they're insistent.  Or we'll do any power options the weather desk wants.
 
  
     
 Where do we stand on this? I sent Sanjeev some Asian Option Pricing last week; I get the sense he wants to pursue the original stream flow structure (one which were not comfortable with). Let me know what our commercial position is. Thanks

 How is the pricing for the stream flow going?
 
 Please let me know,
