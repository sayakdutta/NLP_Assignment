 The Forbes April 30, 2001 editorial piece "Slow Starters" on page 24 discusses
 the "entry tax" which is the capital burden for starting a new business.  It 
 states that rich countries
 on average have relatively low entry costs while poor countries have 
 stagering entry costs caused
 by corruption, endless beuacracy, and cost of delays.  These "entry hurdles" 
 and asscoiated costs
 do not produce any tangible benefits for consumers, workers or the 
 environment.
 
 We might want to make the analogy of "entry tax" for new deregulated gas & 
 power markets.  Things like
 negotiated third-party access (rather than regulated TPA) substantially slow 
 the speed of new entrants and hence deter competition.
 Negotiated TPA creates uncertainty for new entrants (they never know what 
 they are going to get) and clearly slows
 the new comers down.
 
 I will send you a copy of the Forbes piece.
