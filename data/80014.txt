 
 Jeff, 
 
 FYI, I just got this from Tom.  We don't have a very big opportunity here!  
 Tom did tell me that his numbers were going to be difficult to get.  Not that 
 i don't want to put $5 trillion on our chart, but what do you think we should 
 put as market size?  Nat gas, power and our existing verticals only?  What do 
 you think?
 
 He is the only one to give me a number yet.  I am going to discuss it at the 
 staff meeting.
 
 Mike

 Mike,
 
 Please find attached my initial attempt at 100,000-foot-level numbers for 
 CommodityLogic.  I am happy to discuss further at your convenience.
 
 All the best,
 
 Tom
