 can generate an ISDA master to send to the counterparty.  Sara
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
    
 Sara,
  I just joined Enron about 1 month ago and am just getting use to the 
 process.  Could you start the ISDA process with EnSight Resources.  The 
 address and phone number and contact information are below in the John Suttle 
 memo.  Thank you very much.

 John,
  Could you set up EnSight Resources an account with Enron, so they can 
 transact some NYMEX NG fixed price swaps with us in the near future.  Karen 
 Anthony is the CFO and she can provide you any financials that you need to 
 get them set-up.
 
 The address is:
 
 Karen Anthony
 CFO
 EnSight Resources, LLC
 333 Texas St, Suite 1175
 Shreveport, LA 71101

 Thanks for your help in this matter.
