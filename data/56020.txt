 
 Margaret,
 
 I don't have it. Maybe we can get a copy directly from  the CBOT.
 Info  Central could help.

 Margaret,
 
 First of all I apologize for not sending you the information to complete the 
 chart that you gave me.  I have been travelling because of work and then 
 vacation, maybe I spent 3 or 4 full working days in the office in the last 4 
 weeks.  Now that I am going through my to do list I cannot find that page 
 that you gave me .  Could you  please send it to me again?
 
 On the other hand I was wondering if maybe within Enron possibly at Info 
 Central or with one of your friends at the trading desk you could get me a 
 copy of a book titled:                   Chicago Board of Trade Commodity 
 Trading Manual 
                       ISBN: 1579580025
                       Publisher: Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers, Incorporated
                       Pub.   It si not in stock at the dot com libraries and it will take them a long 
 time to deliver.   I need this bbok in order to produce a document that Steve 
 Kean requested from me a couple of weeks ago.
 
 Thank you very much for your help.
 
 Best,
 
 Ricardo
