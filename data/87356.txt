 We have reservations for 7 p.m. tomorrow at Boudro's on the Riverwalk.  It 
 comes highly recommended, and of course, the company will be wonderful!  We 
 will need to leave La Cantera about 6:15 or 6:20, so let's plan to meet at 
 6:15 at the front desk.  If this is somewhat ambiguous when we get there, 
 then I'll leave word for you there or look for you.  See you!
