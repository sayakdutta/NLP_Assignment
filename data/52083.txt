 Iris had asked if it was possible to get a room in London with a kitchenette 
 so she could make some of her own meals since she is vegetarian .  The 
 Anetheum has apartments with kitchens but they cost a $100 a day more than 
 the regular room.   Should I just give her a regular room?    Sorry to bother 
 you with all of this, but I don't know the appropriate thing to do in this 
 case.
