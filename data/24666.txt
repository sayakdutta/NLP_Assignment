 I am guessing that you guys have market knowledge of shut-in costs for western Canada.  We have heard all of the typical low price rumors of Rockies shut-ins at a dollar.  I am going to put Steve South and Paul Lucci in charge of presenting a shut-in analysis by field in the Rockies and san juan.  What do I need to have these guys look at in terms of variable costs.  Is it as simple as gathering and processing?  
 
 Let me know your thoughts.
 
 Thanks,
