 
 That's so weird, I'm been running around the office all day today yelling; we're done, we're done. But only for a different reason.  Do you want your old job   back?  Congrat's on school.  Come down here and buy us a drink! 
 
 
     
 
 I'm done!!  I'm all done!!  Remember when I left you guys a message after
 having my eyes done?  Well this is the same feeling.  It's just so great, I
 had to share it with all of you.  It's a tremendous feeling.  I can't stop
 smiling.  Thanks for all your help on my many little projects for school.
 
 Talk to you guys later.  Take care,
 
 Jess
