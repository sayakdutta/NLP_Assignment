 I received a brief report on the meetings we today with the IFC on weather 
 derivatives.  It sounds like the meetings wenet very well and that there is 
 much to follow up on here in DC.  We are pleased to do so.   I would like to 
 ask that we have more consultation with your group in planning the meetings 
 as we move forward.   John Hardy and his folks know these groups well and we 
 can give valuable input in how to maximize our time with the multilateral 
 institutions.  Thanks.
