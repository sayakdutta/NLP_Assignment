 today at 11 AM.  Quesiton:  After Clinton's speech, don't you think the 
 convention is going to cry when they have to sit through Al Gore?  I'm 
 worried----he's so pathetic.
 
 
 
 



   
 
 
 
 I thought was pretty awesome!? My favorite was his Harry Truman quote that I 
 had never heard before:? "If you want to live like a Republican, you better 
 vote like a Democrat."? Scotty - maybe that's a line you can use!
 
 Joke: 
 Memory Clinic 
 Two elderly couples were enjoying friendly conversation when 
 one of the men asked the other, "Fred, how was the memory 
 clinic you went to last month?" 
 
 "Outstanding," Fred replied. "They taught us all the latest 
 psychological techniques: visualization, association, etc. 
 It was great." 
 
 "That's great! And what was the name of the clinic?" 
 
 Fred went blank. He thought and thought, but couldn't 
 remember. Then a smile broke across his face and he asked, 
 "What do you call that flower with the long stem and 
 thorns?" 
 
 "You mean a rose?" 
 
 "Yes, that's it!" 
 
 He turned to his wife, "Rose, what was the name of that 
 memory clinic?"
