 Shelley, I wish you the best of luck and God's blessings on your trip!
 Hopefully, all will go smoothly.  We will be praying for you and Alina.  If
 there is something I can help Kim and Chad with while you are gone, or some
 help you need when you get back, please don't hesitate to ask.  We are here
 to help!!
 
 


  
 
 
 Attached is a copy of an outline of the children's Christmas Eve service
 that 
 I reviewed with Patty last night.  I have delivered a hard copy of the 
 outline and readings to the Church Office.  Sorry to dash off an email 
 without calling everyone -before I leave town.
 
 Nancy - I'm hoping that you are still amenable to playing the piano.  If you
 
 have selections that you prefer -- feel free to change my selections.  They 
 were picked only because the kids know these songs.  It is particularly a
 joy 
 to hear them sing the chorus of "The First Noel."
 
 Babara Thompson - I was hoping that you could ask the children at children's
 
 church whether any of them are interested in volunteering to read for the 
 worship .
 
 Stephanie - I am hoping that you can line up an adult leader willing to play
 
 overall MC and to read the Christmas message.  If you find someone- please 
 let Patty know.  Otherwise I think she may be amenable to pinchhit.
 
 Lisa C. - Could you please line up a greeter/door tender for the worship.  
 And, also check with the trustees to make sure the sanctuary is unlocked in 
 time.
 
 
 Thanks everyone.  I just lover rattling off email orders!
