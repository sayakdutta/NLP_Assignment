 Paul, in comparing freight rates for Med vs Caribs and Caribs vs Caribs (cargo size), I do see Bo's point.  
 
 For smaller lot sizes (8,600 - 11,800 MT), the rates are abt.:
 	$50 - $60 W. Africa to Med and 
  	$60 - $80 W. Africa to Caribs
 
 however,
 
 the larger cargoes (20,000 - 30,000 MT) curently moving are as follows:
 	$30 - $40 W. Africa to Med and
 	$40 - $60 W. Africa to Caribs
 
 So, in comparison to the Med, the additional freight incurred on moving a 8,600 MT cargo to 
 Puerto Rico vs a 20,000 MT cargo to the Med is $40.00, or for an 11,800 MT cargo $20.00.
 
 Granted, these are not negotiated numbers, so they could be slightly better.
 
 Let me know your thoughts.
 
 Just keep in mind that PDVSA is there to supply an October cargo at +7.  I would hesitate to purchase from an alternative source lest they back off on other negotiations.
 
 Best regards,
 Suzanne
