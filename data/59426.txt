 Albert,
 
 I spot checked a few of these and they are not all official.  Can you please list only the Nov 30th official post-id's?  I can't tell from your post-id sheets if I'm picking the correct ones.
 
 Thanks
 
 
 
  
     
 Here is the Post ID's that we officialized on November 30th.  Call me if you have any questions.
