 
 The only other matters I know of are (i) the Thursday morning interview of 
 Timothy Hailes for a position in the Houston Swap Group and (ii) that Mark 
 mentioned to me that he is planning a trip up to Teeside on Wednesday.  We 
 are trying to set up another interview on Thursday (with David Lacey) but it 
 hasn't been finalized yet.
