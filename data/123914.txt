 Stacey,
 
 Wondering if you could provide a little help.  The career services
 assistance packet we picked up on our way out listed an email address to
 send our resumes.  The email was listed as follows:
 

 
 It doesn't work.  For one thing email addresses do not have spaces between
 words, it is usually a . or _ but not a blank space, the email program will
 not accept a blank space.
 
 I tried emailing to



 
 Every one of them got returned.  Is the email address not functional yet or
 am I am missing something?  Could you forward this email to the appropriate
 person?  In the mean time I will try the fax numbers provided.
 
 Thanks
 
 Also thank you for forwarding those voicemails.  Having been in Houston for
 less than 6 months and reentering the working world after being a full-time
 student for 2 years, my contact base in Houston is very limited.  At least I
 will be able to call a few people in the morning.
 
 Thank you
