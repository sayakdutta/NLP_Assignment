 Brain,
 This version is OK.
 Looks like you have some extra text in the headings for items 14 & 15, for
 the other software package.
 
 John,
 *   GE can sign this version of the consolidation agreement (Brian can
 edit the headings for 14 & 15).
 *   The last versions of the On & Off Shore agreements can be signed
 (Those with Brain's 12/Jun/00).
 *   The "Letter (Termination) Agreement" can be signed (The version with
 K. Mann's 13/Jun/00).
 Please advise status of GEIOC signature on Consolidation Agreement and
 On-Shore Contract
 
 Regards,
 Jeff Smith

 Sorry guys:
 
 I added the clause on the Parent Guarantee and without thinking, made it a
 GE
 obligation.  It was supposed to be an Enron requirement.  So I have
 corrected
 that in Clause 15.  GE already has the same obligation in the Contracts.
 
 John Schroeder:  This will be the Version that we execute, so please forward
 this one to your guy in Mexico.
