 
 Ehud,
 
 Thanks for your  message.
 
 I have talked briefly to Rick about it and we came to the conclusion that we could substitute Greg Whalley 
 for Jeff. I assume that your interest is more in having a speaker from Enron than a specific person.
 
 Of course, we have to get on Greg's calendar but I can make these arrangements as soon as I hear from you.

 Vince / Rick,
 
 Greetings.
 
 With the two-week passage of time since the 8/14 announcement, I write at
 this time to inquire:
 
 1.  Has sufficient time elapsed for this to be a propitious time to raise
 this issue?
 2.  Does the issue require re-visiting, and would a renewed invitation be
 favorably received by both Skilling and Enron?
 
 My colleagues and I look forward to Vince's 9/10 visit.  Best,
 Ehud
