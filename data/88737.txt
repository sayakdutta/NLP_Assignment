 
 Nancy,
 
 Thanks for your e-mail.  Regarding  Section 1.2, ENA  perfers  the "Oral 
 Procedure" which as noted  in  Section 1.2 on page two is considered a 
 "writing" and to have been "signed".  For all transactions under the GISB, a 
 written confirmation will be sent by ENA  notwithstanding the choice  "Oral" 
 on the first page.   
 
 I am checking on the status of the term deal. 
 
 Regards,
