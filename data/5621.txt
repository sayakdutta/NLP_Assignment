 as far as enron, i think long term it is a buy, but wall street has no confidence in managament and there is definately a negative sentiment.  i think in the short term we will definately see the teens.

 sorry i am so late in returning the e-mail, but have been on vacation since last wednesday.  as far as enron, it looks like another down day today on the open.  i hate to tell you to sell now, but i wouldn't want to own enron right now.  i could see enron moving down to the teens much easier than moving up to the thirties.  i might just sell now and look to buy backl ower.
  
 let me know what you think

 Good morning. Do you have any advice about whether I should unload ENE? Seems it cannot take a forward step without then taking 3 steps back. I have never seen a company so effectively shoot itself in the foot. What do you think?-L
