 I'm guessing that Peoples wants to use this form in lieu of the credit 
 agreement.  Maybe I'm wrong.

 Kay -- The attached notes look like they would be used for member loans to 
 Enovate under the LLC Agmt (i.e., loans for capital expenditures and other 
 purposes not covered by the credit facilities provided under the Credit 
 Agreements).   (As you'll see when you review the attachments, those notes 
 are non-interest bearing demand notes.)
 
 Re:  the attached form of note -- it should work for purposes of member loans 
 under the LLC Agmt, but you will need to decide how the LLC Agmt loans and 
 the Credit Agreement's revolving loans "work" together ... i.e., can the LLC 
 Agmt loans be paid from cash flow that would otherwise go to pay down the 
 revolvers, and will they be subordinated to the revolvers?

 I haven't looked at this yet...
