 Paul and Mark,
 
 You should be able to get into the Caminus system as outlined below, after you have been added to the user group.
 
 To initiate the installation of the Caminus Zai*Net application, the users should perform the following:
 
 Click Start button
 Click Programs menu
 Click Business Applications menu
 Double click the Caminus ZaiNet option
 
 
 After you reboot your system, you will be able to log in to Caminus Zai*net.  Your User ID is your first and last initials, followed by the numbers "01" (e.g. Fred Flintstone would be FF01), and your initial password is "password".  You will be prompted to change your password on initial log in.
 
 Thanks,
 Vince Strohmeyer
