 
 Please note Maviglio's comments in response to Sec of State Bill Jones' claim 
 that Davis' consultants have violated ethics laws by not filing conflict of 
 interest reports with the state while working for Davis.  Maviglio sez:
 
 Jones is "on a witch hunt on something outside his jurisdiction." 
 Mark, quit feeding PR lines to Davis' people.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
