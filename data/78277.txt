 Estelle and Barbara:
 
 PPL's lenders have requested two items relating to the escrow prior to
 funding:
 
 1.  Fax copy of the Escrow Agreement signed by Citibank; and
 2.  E-mail confirmation that the escrow account has been opened.
 
 Can you please furnish these items as early as possible on Thursday morning.
 The parties intend to fund the escrow before 10:00 central time.  The money
 needs to make one stop before it gets to you, so the earlier it can get
 started the better.  Please furnish these items to the following
 individuals:
 



 
 Thank you.
