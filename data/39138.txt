 The Australian Financial Markets Association has sent to ISDA a copy of
 CLERP6, the draft legislation reforming the Australian Corporations Law
 relating to securities and derivatives.  We  understand that is expected to
 be implemented in January 2001.  ISDA has not yet reviewed the draft.
 
  We attach a copy of the draft legislation for your information
