 of
 our monthly flowing volume requirements for the NIPSCO Choice program,
 including estimated peak-day requirements (part of which come out of
 storage).   I am referring to the values in Cols. L,M, and N in the attached.
 Can you please give us a price quote for getting these volumes to the NIPSCO
 citygate?
 
 Please call me if you have questions.
 
 Thanks.
