 Jim and I will be on vacation from March 12th thru March 16th.  Jim took a lap top computer with him and is reachable by cell phone.  Kim has our pager and cell phone numbers.  I will be calling in to see how Eric is doing and to see if any of my folks have any questions about their employment contracts.  I asked Philip to keep an eye on Eric as well.  Eric sat in the morning meeting today and will fill for me next week.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Tom
