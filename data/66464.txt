 I want to apologize to everyone for my Houdini act on Friday.  I went home to get a new battery for my cell phone (the phone died, I didn't turn it off), change clothes, etc. and ended up falling asleep on my couch.  It's lame but that is what happened.  I understand you had trouble finding the house (from cell messages).  Again, I am sorry for not getting back in touch.  
 
 Thanks
 Harry B.
