 Sara,
 
 I was interested in the 1991 and 1998 definitions because they referenced by 
 name in the Rabo-RBC TRS Confirmation (Cerberus restructuring).  I didn't 
 realize there was a newer version of the definitions.  Unless that 
 Confirmation is scheduled to be modified to refer solely to the 2000 
 definitions, I'd like to get a copy of all 3 if possible.
 
 Thanks,
 Bill
 
 
    
  
 Bill:  Is there a reason why you don't want the ISDA 2000 Definitions/Annex A 
 (which supercede the 1991 and 1998 Definitions)?  Sara

 Sara,
 
 Brent suggested you might have copies of the above-referenced documents that 
 you could e-mail or interoffice to me (EB 1768).  If not, any suggestions 
 regarding where I might get my hands on them?
 
 Thanks,
 Bill
