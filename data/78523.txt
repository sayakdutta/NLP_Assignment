 
 This is the rock gym party.  I bought presents for this and the Houstonian 
 party, which is next Wednesday.

 Is this the one at the Houstonian? What are the hours? Maybe I could drop
 him off and come back to pick him up? NM

 Yikes!  I just realized that tomorrow is Mason's birthday party.  I know
 Michael would love to go.  Both my husband and I work, but I will attempt
 to take off and bring him.  Thanks for the invitation.
