 Carolyn/Kay - 
 I apologize for the latest of getting these documents to you, but I was 
 unaware of the timeline until just an hour ago. 
 
 Doug/John - I've left 5 originals of each letter for Jeff's signature in his 
 office.? He will sign when he gets in and I will bring them around to you 
 around 8am.
