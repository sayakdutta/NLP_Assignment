 
 That's fine with me - I've booked it.  Just let me know if you need to change the time.
 
  
     
 Mark,
 
 How does 3-4pm on Monday work for you ?  Jay Webb can meet at that time as well.  However, Brad Richter might need to push the time back a bit since he is arriving from Europe that day.
 
 Thanks,
 Carin
