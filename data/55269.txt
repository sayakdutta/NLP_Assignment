 Yes. I would appreciate it.

 The only one I can find is the Dhabol one.  Do you still want that one 
 alone?  I'm sorry we don't have the others.

 Beth,
 
 Thanks. 
 
 Dhabol is one. There should be 2 more case studies we used.
 One about old EGS, the 2nd about TVA options.
 
 2-3 copies will be sufficient.

 I just found some copies!  How many do you need and I will have them 
 delivered to you.
 
 They are the case about the Dabhol project in India.  Is that the one you 
 were thinking of?

 Beth,
 
 I have a favor to ask. Do we have copies of Harvard Business School
 case studies about Enron? We use these case studies during Super Saturdays.
 I need a few copies. This is for Prof. John Martin.
