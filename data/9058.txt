 originated it so that the Manager section can be completed.  By including the 
 manager's name, that will help me to identify who this person is, what job 
 they perform and whether or not the request makes sense.  I have over 400 
 people in my group, so without more detail on these requests it is not worth 
 taking my time to approve these.  --Sally
