 
 First of all, this is a brand-new contract, not a modification of one that 
 used to be IT.
 It's for LFT space that we have posted according to our usual procedure.  A 
 receipt point has now been specified:  Bloomfield Compressor.  Our tariff 
 allows us to cancel LFT up to 10 days a month, but it also provides that the 
 parties can agree that the number of days can be fewer, so Sempra negotiated 
 us down to only one day.  TK worked with Darrell Schoolcraft on this and they 
 determined this would be acceptable from an operational standpoint.  
 Scheduling will happen pursuant to the LFT priority set forth in our tariff.
 I left a message for you just now; call when you have a minute.

 Susan, MKM's got some good questions about this.  I'm still nervous as a cat 
 about the deals, so please give me a call Mon. AM and let me know what you 
 know about the scheduling priority and how it has changed now that this is an 
 LFT deal.  DF

 We really do need to understand the scheduling of this,  if alternates 
 haven't been scheduled, IT are and now an LFT---  seems a little 
 questionable, so we need to understand the answer.  Also without knowing the 
 receipt point how do we know the deal can be done as LFT??  MK

 I forgot to add that this is an LFT.
