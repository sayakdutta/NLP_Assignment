 There has been some confusion as to the schedule for Thursday and Friday.
 
 Thursday is intended to be used to review presentations and concepts and 
 generally prepare for the larger Friday meeting. As of yet, we have not 
 scheduled any formal meeting times on Thursday.
 
 Friday is the "official" presentation day. Although the core group can expect 
 to be offsite for the entire day, other non-EnronOnlinians will only be there 
 from 10 am to 12 pm. These two hours will contain the most critical phase 2 
 information and discussions and will follow this agenda (incorporating 
 various presentations/parts of presentations as decided on Thursday):
 
  1.  Phase 1.1+  Changes to the current system based on trader and customer 
 feedback and issues.
  2. Phase 2
  (i)  Technical
  (ii)  Content & Community
