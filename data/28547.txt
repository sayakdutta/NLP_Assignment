 Last brief draft for now!
  
     
 Attached is the initial draft of the NGA Section 5 argument for the pipeline petitioners' joint brief opposing segmentation.
 
 I have attached the document in both Word and WordPerfect.  The document was converted into WordPerfect from Word, which should explain any WordPerfect formatting problems.
 
 The Statement of the Case for the segmentation brief will be circulated on Tuesday morning.
