 
 Joe,
 
 Thanks for the email.  Project Summer does bring up some big questions and 
 issues and I am not up to speed on the current thinking.  We'll talk later 
 and i'll find out the issues and viewpoints.  On your other issue, I 
 understand and we'll discuss.
 
 Thanks,
 mike

 Mike,
 
 You have probably heard that a tentative agreement has been reached on 
 Project Summer.
 
 When convenient, I would like to talk to you about what that means for the 
 South Amercia Networks effort.  Given that we have been pursuing this stuff 
 through a matrix approach many questions arise.
 
 I am not sure of the Project Summer view or the Enron view.  I have the 
 feeling it is not a "big blip" on anyone's radar screen. 
 
 I did not bring this up during the weekly call because D'Arcy and Steve do 
 not know anything (at least officially and/or from me).
 
 Also, for what it is worth, I am assessing personal options at this point.  I 
 am not necessarily wed to the "Newco" (unless Enron puts out a former EI 
 hiring moratorium) despite what people may be assuming.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kish
