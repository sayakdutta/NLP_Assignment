 All:
 
 Best wishes for a restful and pleasant holiday season!  The time off is well 
 deserved.
 
 I also wish to express my sincere appreciation for the hard work and 
 dedication displayed by each of you over the past year.  I'm well aware of 
 the long hours and individual contributions that are not always widely 
 known.  However, comments and notes received, particularly during the last 
 half of 1999, suggest that others not only notice your individual 
 contributions but have also come to appreciate RAC's value to the overall 
 organisation.  Your individual efforts during 1999 reflected well on us all.
 
 I look forward to seeing each of you after the holiday season and wish you a 
 happy and prosperous New Year. 
 
 
 Warmest Regards,
 
 Steve
