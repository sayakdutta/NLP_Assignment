 There are several little features that EOL traders such as myself would like 
 to see on the website and stack manager.  I realize that there may be bigger 
 issues being worked on currently, but would it be possible for EOL to survey 
 Enron traders as well as outside traders on suggestions for enhancements??  
 For example, I'd like to be able to sort completed trades by date on stack 
 manager.  Also, it would be nice if we could have a shading feature on the 
 website, so people could shade products different colors.  This might cut 
 down on trades made in error.
 
 Thanks,
