 Pan Canadian Energy Services has the following request:
 
 For all EOL traded deals they do not want to recieve the Annex A that is 
 attached to our Omnibus-EOL templates.  They claim that since they have 
 already signed off on the GTC in order to trade on EOL, then they do not want 
 to repeat any work and have to review an additional GTC when we send them a 
 Confirmation.  Is it possible to exclude any Annex A (GTC) when we send an 
 Omnibus Confirmation for trades done on EOL?
 

 
 Thanks,
 Joe
