 
 Theresa Staab and I would like to come to Houston on Monday and spend some time with you and Jason on Tuesday.  We need to discuss some specifics on the purchase proposal such as how you want each netback to be determined, logistics and documentation.
 
 Let me know what time would work for you on Tuesday.  We probably need a fair amount of time.
 
 Tyrell and I are working on a monetization structure for your gathering system.  Can you tell me if the Oil and Gas Division was able to keep the gains associated with the rollout of the hedges?  We think we might have a structure worth looking at.
 
 P.S. Dan and I would like to call you on Friday in regards to the Ft Union capacity.  Some time in the afternoon.
