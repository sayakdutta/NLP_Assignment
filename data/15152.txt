 Fran,
 
 I'm pretty sure I've already been hit for some of these.  If you could provide me a P&L copy from June 1 thru today (either electronic or paper) I'd appreciate it.
 
  
     
 Sean and Diana:
 
 Just wanna give you a heads up.  From Settlements we learned that there will be -$870,820.56 prior month adjustments in your book due to BPA and Modesto related deals .  I have researched on all the items and believe they are valid.  Please take a look and let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  If you don't disagree you shall expect to see this hit in your P&L for 8/31/01.

 Please also note that there might be other items to come between now and the end of this month.  I will let you know when that happens.
 
 Thanks,
 Fran
