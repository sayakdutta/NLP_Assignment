 Please find attached for your review the most recent form of the above 
 agreement, blacklined to show the changes to the previous draft distributed 
 to you.  I believe that we have now settled on the form of the agreement, but 
 there remain a few commercial issues which we will be resolving in the next 
 week or so.  If anyone has any final comments on the form, please communicate 
 them to me as soon as possible.  I would also like to have any input from Rob 
 Hemstock and Aleck Dadson on any particular issues relating to market 
 operations in Ontario or Alberta.  I also need someone in the Toronto office 
 to provide me with the definition of "Interval Meters" that I have included 
 as a potential delivery point.  I have left that definition as a bullet and 
 we will need to fill it in or remove it, if the latter makes more sense.  
 Finally, once the last few business issues are resolved next week, I would 
 like to set up a call with Jeff Hodge and Elizabeth Sager to obtain final 
 internal legal approval on this agreement so that our commercial people can 
 commence marketing the paper to potential counterparties.  Mark Powell will 
 be using this form of the agreement in conjunction with the current ENA form 
 of physical power GTC to prepare a Canadian form of physical power GTC that 
 may be used to transact physical power transactions of less than one year in 
 duration with counterparties with whom we do not have masters in place.
 
 Thanks
 
 Greg
