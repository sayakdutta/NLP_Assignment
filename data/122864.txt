 
 Check out NOK Feb 55 puts, NZYMK.X  They are up 4-5/8 while NOK is down  
 4-5/8.  2932 contracts out wth 24 traded today so liquidity shouild be OK.
 
 Buy 400 ERICY for ~$4000 and one NOK put contract of NZYMK.x.  That should 
 give you a delta on NOK equiv to shorting $4000 of the stock.
 
 Did I figure this right?
