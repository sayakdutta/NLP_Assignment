 
 Hi.  I'm here -- just barely though -- my sinus infection is back.  Can we get together in my office (the less elevator riding the better) sometime between 11-1?  I'm planning to be out of office tomorrow.
 
  
     
 Shelley:
 Welcome back! I was wondering if you had 30 minutes today to discuss NNG's major customers from a strategic perspective.  Stan has asked me (on a very confidential basis) to explore various "buy back" options for NNG, including raising a lot of money!  I wanted to get your thoughts on certain customers' willingness to participate in an ownership interest in NNG.  I did not want to meet with Dave and his team given the Dynegy transition. I am free all morning except at 9 and this afternoon except from 2 to 4.
