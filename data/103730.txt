 
 Brent, Andrea and I had a "status" conversation this afternoon.  Brent will 
 go to Sao Paulo on July 20 to meet with Andrea, Randy and commercial people.  
 Andrea has requested that you and I go to Brazil after July 28 when the 
 outside lawyer is back from vacation.  In general, the three of us are 
 conforming and updating physical resolutions (final and proposed) and 
 identifying additional research necessary to address the financial trading 
 issues.  These are related to specific deals originating in Brazil (which are 
 truly settled financially, e.g., a purported prepay where no physical 
 commodity was to be delivered) and issues arising here in Houston (e.g., the 
 Hickerson request for fixed income, FX and equity trading).  Brent will be 
 discussing pending transaction structures while in Sao Paulo. 
 
 It appears  that Brent is the "point person" for dealing directly with the 
 Sao Paulo office and he will bring me in as necessary (although I will be 
 dealing frequently with Andrea).
