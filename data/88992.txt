 
  Thanks for your e-mail,  I will be out of the office for next week,  I will get my attorney to review this final revision upon my return and we can close.
 
 thanks
 
  
     
 Debra:
 
 Attached is a redline version of the GISB Addendum we've been negotiating.
 My attorney edited the first paragraph to clarify things based on our
 previous conversation.  Take a look and let me know if it meets your
 approval. If this is OK, then I'll send you originals for execution.
 
 Thanks,
