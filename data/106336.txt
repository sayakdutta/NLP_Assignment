 P.S.  Also, what's going on with Caroline Abramo and the hedge funds?

 Hi Sara, see the message below about the Merchant Energy deal.  I believe 
 this deal has not been completed yet.
 
 Thanks,
 Melissa

 Mega just called and said they are going to hold off on this deal until later 
 in the week. I spoke to Brent Hendry who gave me some good information re: 
 the confirm and said we could just work directly with the Confirms Group to 
 get the Confirm out if and when the deal is done.   Sorry for the fire 
 drill.  
 
  
 Thanks

 Hello Carol, I know Sara is on vacation.  Below is a draft confirmation 
 letter that Sara and I prepared for a deal that Chris Foster in the Portland 
 office may do today.  If he does do this deal will you be the attorney to 
 look at the confirm?
 
 Thanks,
 Melissa

 Sara:
 
 I received a call from Mega today.  That financial gas/power deal could come 
 together today.  Attached is the draft confirm you prepared.  Let me know 
 ASAP if you have any "issues" with closing this deal pursuant to the language 
 you prepared.  I will contact you immediately if it closes.
 
 Thanks!
 
 Chris
