 The Enron Corporate Policy Committee has been invited to attend the Tuesday, 
 December 12th Board meeting. The meeting begins in Executive Session, a 
 closed session, involving the Board members at 8:00 a.m. Following the 
 Executive Session, the Corporate Policy Committee will be asked to join the 
 Open Session beginning at approximately 9:00 a.m. Since we are never sure of 
 the exact length of the Executive Session, we request that, if you are 
 attending, you wait in EB5001 until the Executive Session is completed.
