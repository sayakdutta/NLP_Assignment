 I am going to pass on the current offer.  I want to hold on to Taylor.  I
 don't think Garner will be worth a shit.  Now if you would want to do
 Watters for Robinson straight up, I would do that.

 My tickets are in the student section for the game - I have four.  I don't
 know if you want to sit in the student section b/c you really won't be
 sitting much - most of the students stand up the entire game.  So, if you
 want to sit, we need to work on getting some seats in the alumni section.
 
 Jason - if you and Donnita want to come, you can have my two extra seats in
 the student section, assuming what I said above is correct.
 
 Let me know
