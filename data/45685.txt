 
 Per an email from Soma yesterday, Brian Hull wanted to transact out of their 
 Toronto Branch, so I used their Toronto address in the agreement.  We do not 
 have "transactions numbers" on our ISDA's.  I would take it if things proceed 
 today, that we will date the agreement as of today, so the date of the 
 agreement will be the only identifying information.  Toronto-Dominion will 
 need to look at the notice information I put in the agreement and confirm 
 that it is acceptable.  I pulled it from a recent agreeement they sent us.

 Sara/Tana, do you know the answers to Kevin's questions below?  If so, could 
 you e-mail the particulars to him as soon as possible.
 
 Thanks

 As per my voicemail, attached are the officer's certificates we will require.
 
 Do you know what address TD Bank will be using on the ISDAs?  (presumably 
 their Calgary Main Branch)  also, are there transaction numbers for each of 
 the ISDAs yet so that we can fill in the blanks on the certificate and 
 opinions (RE ISDA Agreement Master No. ?)
 
 Thanks
 
 Kevin
