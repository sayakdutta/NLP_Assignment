 Enclosed for your review are the draft comments on the Revised Proposed
 Decision in the Gas Restructuring Investigation.  WGSI and Enron have
 indicated a desire to file supportive comments.  Edison has indicated an
 interest in reviewing our draft for the purpose of considering joining in
 our comments.  Please send edited electronic versions with underline and
 strikeout to MBD at this address no later than noon tomorrow. These comments
 must be filed tomorrow before 5 pm.  I am sorry for the lateness of the
 draft, but these are not extensive comments.  Except for the little
 bombshell about extending commission jurisdiction over gas marketers, I see
 little in the RPD to warrant our opposition.  Even if the Commission
 proceeds with the jurisdictional grab, I believe it can be overturned by the
 Court of Appeals.
 
 I look forward to your comments.
 
 Mike Day
