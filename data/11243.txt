 
 Spoke w/ Skilling re OI "binary" decision. He is willing to enter into the 
 deal. His rational is that he thinks we will be ok on OWC in the final 
 analysis. He did  say to reserve for the deal adequately and structure it as 
 appropriate for the circumstances. He also wanted to know if there is 
 anything different here than on OWC. I told him that it wasn't significantly 
 different (both strong underlying businesses with huge event risk attached)
 
 Lets get dash completed and then I will voice mail Jeff w/ specifics and get 
 his verbal signature.
