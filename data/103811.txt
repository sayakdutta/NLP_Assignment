 like a copy of the Japanese materials.  thanks.  Sara

 I had to order a set of the ISDA Japanese documents for John Viverito, who 
 will be leaving for Japan soon, so if anyone needs a copy I have them.  Also, 
 London sent me a copy of the Amsterdam Power Exchange Rules, which I don't 
 think anyone will need, but if you do, I have those too.
