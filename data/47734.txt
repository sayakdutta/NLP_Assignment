 
 Per my voicemail, attached is the assignment of the FPL trade.  If you could 
 please attach as Exhibit A, the specifics of the trade and then fax the 
 assignment to the counterparty.  When the counterparty faxes the signed 
 Assignment back we will have to have it initialled by a lawyer since it is a 
 contract, and send it up to me and I will get someone to sign it.
