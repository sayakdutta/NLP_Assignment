 Prearranged Release Agreement and the Trailblazer PA Assignment Agreement.  
 The documents have been revised to reflect the amendment to Transaction No.1 
 to increase the DCQ by 6, 195 MMBtu per day.  A few other cleanup changes 
 were also made.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
