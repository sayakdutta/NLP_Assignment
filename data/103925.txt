 Notes for confirm comments.

 I left a message with Judy Lee on Wednesday and left a voice mail with Scott 
 as well.  I have not heard back from Swiss Re yet.

 I received a call from Judy Lee at Swiss RE (212-317-5523) regarding the 
 standard confirmation we use.  She said that their legal department wishes to 
 omit Section 4 on Representation.  I said I would forward it on to our legal 
 department for consideration.  Below, I have attached the most recent confirm 
 we sent them.  Please advise on how I should proceed.
 Thanks
 Scott
