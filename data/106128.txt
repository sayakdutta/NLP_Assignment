 Transaction is entered into.

 From a credit standpoint, potential risk of this 25,000 bbls/mo, May'01, 
 financial swap is very small.  But I recognize ECP issues since no support 
 and no information has ever been available.  Can we include a representation 
 that, upon execution, would establish eligibility.  I will manage credit 
 under volume/tenor limits and implied support of a AA parent.  If acceptable, 
 please send language to Confirmations for use in this (v24545) and all future 
 trades.
 
 thanks

 Yes, "eligible contract participant"  ("ECP") is an issue.  Both ENA and 
 ECTRI are Delaware corporations and are therefore subject to the jurisdiction 
 of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the U.S. regulatory agency with 
 oversight for derivatives).  As a practical matter, I understand that ECTRI 
 does have many executed ISDA agreements.  I do not know the volume of 
 "omnibus" trades.  However, the ECTRI omnibus should have ECP representations 
 in the annex.

 A financial trade v24545 was done with Total International Limited.  This 
 entity is subsidiary of a very good credit customer, TotalElf (S&P rated 
 AA-).  Risk is acceptable, small volumes, short tenor, but from a legal 
 standpoint, I do not think this entity is an "Eligible Contract Party" as we 
 have no guaranty support or financial statements to support trading.  I 
 noticed that quite a bit of financial trades are currently booked in London 
 with this customer.  Does Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp. 
 (London financial) have the same ECP requirements as ENA.  If so, I would 
 like to know how they have established eligibility.
