As part of the June transition ENA will not be doing any bidweek business at points other than Waha, Katy Tailgate and Carthage.  Therefore even if we wanted to cover this deal (which we don't), we can't.  Let me know if there is a problem with them getting there own transportation agreement.

 just a quick reminder that we need to cover the Entex delivery off of Oasis.
 
 currently ENA has a transport agreement on Oasis.  This agreement will not be assigned.
 
 Not use AEP has an agreement on Oasis.  Just to make sure, I would recommend we
 sale the gas to AEP/HPL at the point for the month of June just to make sure the delivery
 is made.
 
 Let me know what you think.
 
 thanks
