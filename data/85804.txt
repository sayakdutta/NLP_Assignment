 Let's discuss

 We expect a ruling in the 336 docket to allocate receipt point capacity on =
 El Paso, and that could be done before the end of the year.  BUT, we expect=
  that will be subject of rehearing applications and possibly even court app=
 eal.  And that allocation is likely to be revised if and when the full requ=
 irements/capacity problems get addressed in the other dockets in which they=
  are pending.  So, the possibility of revisions to receipt point allocation=
 s exist even after an order is issued, and is final and non-appealable in 3=
 36.  The language in the draft agreement states that Huber acknowledges tha=
 t EP's capacity allocation procedures are under review by FERC and that the=
  capacity under contract will be bound by any modifications resulting from =
 any FERC proceeding related to such capacity allocation procedures.  I thin=
 k this is broad enough to cover all potential FERC actions, as it says "any=
 " FERC proceeding.  Since we want to keep it open for future revisions, I w=
 ould not advise inserting the usual  "final, non-appealable order" since yo=
 u want to be able to track any changes that come along, however they may be=
  themselves changed by a later order. =20
 
 Hope this makes sense.  =20
 
  
     
 
 Oops - here they are...

 ndicator that triggers events.

 Attached are the latest based on our discussions.  I couldn't redline the C=
 apacity Release Agreement, so I am only sending a clean version.  I would s=
 till make a general caveat, that we still need to do a final review of the =
 gathering agreement.  This could add to the Transaction Agreement.
