 Please see the below.  The VMAC agreement we did for CommodityLogic, if you do not already have it in your files, is in my O drive in CommodityLogic under Confidentiality Agreements.  I password protected it.  The password is "cllegal".

 Mark, 
 
 We will be discussing a clearing project with them. They would basically provide our customers on EnronOnline an alternative to trade through a cleared mechanism, at a fee to VMAC.

 Please provide me with a brief description of the project or work that is going to be discussed with VMAC and a contact name/e-mail address.  We will do the necessary conflict check and send the agreement to VMAC directly.
 
 Thanks.

 Marc,
 
 Thanks for your prompt response. I currently need the same NDA modified for Enron Net Works. Thanks for your help.

 Pursuant to your voice mail message, attached is a copy of the NDA I prepared for VMAC with CL.  If you need a document of this nature for EOL, please let me know and our office can prepare it and forward it for your use.  The Legal Dept. prepares and forwards NDA's so that we can track them and ensure terms are legally acceptable.
