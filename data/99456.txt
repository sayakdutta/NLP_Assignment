 Camille,
 
 Based on your message below, I believe it advisable to issue a formal notice to Newtown responding to their cancellation notice and reaffirming our legal position on the enforceablility of the Transaction.  I have revised the letter that I prepared for you Friday and would appreciate your review and comment.  Please call me with any questions or comments regarding the attached.

 Steve, 
 
 Thank you for the legal interpretation.  After our conference call today with you and Newtown Paper dismissing the idea that this is a force majeure claim, 
 we held our position to keep this deal on the books.
