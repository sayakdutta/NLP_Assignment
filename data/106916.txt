 
 Chuck:  I am currently in our Buenos Aires office for the week.  I have to 
 resolve our few issues when I return to Houston.  I can tell you, however, 
 that we cannot agree to provide you with the legal opinion as to 
 enforceability as we discussed in our conversation last week.  I'll follow up 
 with you next week.  Sara
 
 
 
 

    
 
 Sara,
 
      Just a quick note to see where we stand.  Please drop me a line when
 you have a moment.
