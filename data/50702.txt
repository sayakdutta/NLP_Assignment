  Vince 
 Thanks again for agreeing to speak at our conference. 
 It is attracting considerable interest. . 
 
 Is it possible for you to send us copies of your slides by May 18 to meet our 
 deadline for 
 preparing the material.? If you have? a related paper available that covers 
 some of the same material that would do instead but 
 naturally we would prefer the slides. 
 
 I would like to mention again the?? the pre-conference dinner at 
 7 pm on Sunday May 30 for the speakers 
 We hope very much you can be present 
 
 I was also hoping you would be available for the last? session of the day to 
 be panel member 
 The provisional title? is 
 Managing Risk in Illiquid Markets 
 The chair is Pat Concessi of Deloitte and Touche 
 The panel last from 3.30 until 4.30 and we would like panel members should 
 speaker for 
 a few minutes and take questions from the floor. 
 
 In the meantime if you have any questions please let Amy or myself know 
 
 Sincerely 
 Phelim P Boyle
