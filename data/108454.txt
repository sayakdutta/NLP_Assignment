 Jeff,
 To ensure that the business units are involved in the recruiting of top 
 quality candidates I am requesting your assistance in the Super Saturday that 
 is scheduled for either Saturday, November 4th, November 11th or December 
 9th.  We would like for you to participate as follows:
 
 Be the speaker at breakfast
 Interview candidates 
 Facilitate the decision making meeting
 
 The breakfast is from 7:30 AM until 8:30 AM.  The speech would begin at 
 approximately 8:00 AM and need not be more than 15 to 20 minutes.  You would 
 interview approximately 4-6 candidates.  A vital part of the process is 
 determining which candidates will receive offers to join the Program.  We 
 would like for you to facilitate the decision making meeting.  The meeting 
 will be held in 5C2 beginning at 1:30 PM. and conclude by 3:30 PM.  We will 
 provide the administrative assistance.
 Your assistance and input would be greatly appreciated.  Please let me know 
 as soon as possible of your availability.
 Thanks in advance.
 
 By the way thanks for the help you have provided with Penn at both the 
 graduate and undergraduate level.  It is very much appreciated.
 
 Charlene
