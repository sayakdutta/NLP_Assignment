 Hi Errol & Sherry,
 
 We received confirmations for the above referenced
 deals from Paribas (they confirm us) and Paribas' confirm
 differs from what we show in TAGG.  Paribas' trader, Herve,
 says that he spoke with John Arnold after the deal was done 
 and changed the price from 8.15 to 8.14 and the index from
 Gas Daily to NYMEX.     TAGG still reflects the terms that
 EOL has.  
 
 Can one of you please find out if John Arnold agreed to these
 changes, and if so, can you make the necessary changes
 to TAGG?  
 
 Let me know.
 Thanks a lot,
 Diane
