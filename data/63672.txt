 
 Hi Sherri -
 
 Ken said that he will pledge $750.00 - $5 per mile.  Sally will pass on to 
 Holly in the Foundation office to prepare a check to get to you.

 Well, the bike is inspected, a few training rides have been made, and the 
 camping gear is being dusted off (yes, he is actually camping at the 
 fairgrounds in LaGrange!).  Now all our fearless leader (and incidentally, 
 the National Multiple Sclerosis Society's 2000 Man of the Year), Jeff 
 Skilling, needs is your help in raising money for MS.
 
 Enron's MS150 Dream Team is bigger than some townships in these parts - over 
 350 Enron employees, led by Jeff, will ride from Houston to Austin under the 
 Enron Flag April 15-16, and the team's goal is to raise $350,000.  I am 
 challenging (is begging a better word?) each of you to pledge a certain 
 amount per mile - i.e., $1, $2, $5, it's your call.  I'll even give you a 
 break on the calculation and use 150 miles, even though Jeff swears it's 
 closer to 170 miles (you know how he is with numbers).  Of course, a flat 
 pledge is also appreciated.  And don't forget, Enron will match your pledge 
 to this very worthy cause 1-1.
 
 I hope you will join the team and help Enron maintain its status as the top 
 money raiser of all MS150 rides in the NATION!  Thank you for your 
 consideration.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call me.
