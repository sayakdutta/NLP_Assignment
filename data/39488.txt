 I have left Jeff and Mike a voicemail suggesting that we sign the CA and take 
 the lead on this.  Will advise when I hear a reply from them

 Rick,
 
 As you recall we had previously decided to have E Power be the counterparty 
 to BHP for formal arrangements in pursuing the terminal opportunity is Japan. 
 Should we reconsider this approach given the new organization. E Power 
 interest is in cheap fuel and not the terminal or pipelines. Please advise 
 and I will handle with Carey. We have a meeting in Japan with BHP on Oct 16th 
 to execute the CA.
