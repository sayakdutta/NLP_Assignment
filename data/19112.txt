 
 FYI.  I'll be participating in a "round table discussion" on California next 
 Monday on the Berkeley campus.  It's being sponsored by the Policy School and 
 some folks from the Business School.  Laura Tyson and a former FCC mucky-muck 
 (Howard Shalansky) will moderate the two panels.  Alums who now work in the 
 energy biz are putting up funding for the event (e.g., Columbia, American 
 Public Power Ass.)  We're providing a modest stipend.
 
 There are two "round tables."  First one is "Why did we do this?," and the 
 second one is "Where to from here?"  I'll be on the second panel.  Go to the 
 attached website for agenda and other info.  I intend to pull from the 
 messages, filings and other materials that we've developed over the course of 
 the last several weeks/months.  I'll distribute talking points for review and 
 comment sometime this week.  But please feel free to send thoughts, 
 suggestions, etc. early and often.  
 
 Best,
 Jeff
