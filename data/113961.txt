 
 Douglas,
 
 Thanks for your interest...My book does go into some option detail (not 
 really collars since they're a combination of the tools I discuss) and plenty 
 of swap transactions.  Obviously, I think you would gain some insight for 
 both your personal and professional interests if you go through it.  Thanks 
 again,
 
 Fletcher Sturm
