 Jim,
 
 This is a note to let you know what happened as per your calls on my behalf.
 
 The short answer is not much.
 
 I had lunch with John Keffer and Randy Coles of King & Spalding.  We had a
 cordial conversation, but I concluded and stated that the firm was well
 covered regarding the skills that I might offer.
 
 John Klauberg and I had a most enjoyable breakfast.  He seemed interested.
 However, I haven't heard any thing.
 
 Pat Oxford didn't return my call. I spoke with Lynn Coleman, but didn't hear
 any thing back.
 
 Vicky Price and I have exchanged calls, but haven't had a chance to speak.
 
 On another fronts, I was contacted by Strasburger regarding their Mexico and
 other Latin work.  They claim to have done a little work for Enron.  Also, I
 am still in discussions with Shook, Hardy & Bacon, the Kansas City firm with
 about 40 lawyers here in Houston.
 
 Before anything get finalized, I would like to run it by you just to get an
 independent reaction.
 
 Thanks for your support and help.
 
 Mont
