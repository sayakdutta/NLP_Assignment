 
 Celeste,
 
 I am recommending Jason Sokolov for summer internship with Enron.
 Jason is currently working part-time for Mike Roberts and makes
 very valuable contribution  to a number on-going projects.
 
 We are very happy with his performance and see him as a valuable future
 Enron employee.

 Vince:
 
 As we discussed earlier, I attached the copy of the petition for my summer 
 internship with Enron Analyst and Associate group.
 I also have the hard copy of the letter, which I will deliver to you 
 presonally.
 
 I am looking forward to, finally, become an official Enron employee.  Thank 
 you very much for your valuable contributions to
 my experience with the company.
 
 Jason Sokolov
