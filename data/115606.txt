 I've passed your phone number along to Bill Williams, the Real Time group 
 manager here in Portland. He should be contacting you shortly to discuss 
 problems with and changes to the Scheduling Activity Report. I've checked 
 with other groups on the floor and found that the report is only used by Real 
 Time, and less frequently by groups assisting Real Time, so I believe Bill or 
 someone in his group could most suitably test the new application. Let me 
 know if there's anything else I can do, and thanks for all your help today.
