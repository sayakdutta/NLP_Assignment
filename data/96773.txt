 I think I may have just committed (by omission) my first (and may be only for this season's) fatal error - I forgot to get ranked and have never been ranked before. I don't know the  rules but I would assume until I get ranked I wouldn't be able to play.  I will try to get ranked ASAP but in the meanwhile.... do you know what the rules require.   I am so sorry if this is causing any problems.   Thanks

 I have you playing the late match at Memorial Park Wednesday night (8:15pm).
 I have you playing Line 4.  We are the home team (Avengers), so please bring
 balls.  Leave enough time to find parking (it shouldn't be bad at that time
 of night).
