 Dear: enymexSM user
 
 
 In a previous e-mail we forwarded for your review an enymexSM registration
 information package. This consisted of both the enymexSM System User
 Agreement and examples of "click-on screens" that users will view and
 complete and agree to when they first log on to the enymexSM system. The
 enymexSM System User Agreement must be signed and returned to Robert A.
 Dagistino, Director of Customer Service, New York Mercantile Exchange, One
 North End Avenue, New York, NY 10282.
 
 In addition to the two documents previously sent, enymexSM trading companies
 will be required to fill out a single Registration Form.  This form is now
 available on the enymexSM website by clicking on to "How Do I Trade?" -
 "Getting Started - Registration for enymexSM". We request that you complete
 this registration form and submit it either on line or print out a copy and
 fax it to:
 (1) the clearing company you intend to use for the clearing of enymexSM
 trading  and;
 (2) the New York Mercantile Exchange, attention Robert  A. Dagistino at
 212-301-4555
 
 Any questions can be answered by contacting Robert A.  Dagistino via email

 may contact our Customer Service Call Center toll free at 1-866-enymexx

 
 
 Sincerely,
 Robert A. Dagistino
 Director of Customer Service
