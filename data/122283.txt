 Thanks, Kim.

 If the fuel is being nominated and scheduled the only volumes hitting the OBA are the diff. between scheduled and actual and that is what the OBA's are for as long as it is not being abused.

 	FYI.  Is everyone comfortable that we are NOT creating an imbalance with Sid
 	Richardson due to fuel?  Just want to be sure we should not check out any
 	additional information.  Terry, thanks for your prompt reply.  Thanks. Lynn
 
  
     
 In the OBA meeting held today 01/03/02. Is the fuel being nominated or not at the Sid Richardson point #500395 or L.E. 8729? Yes it is and has been nominated as far back as I can retrieve information in TMS. The point came active in 12/1995 and remains active today. It is also part of their main OBA contract #21758. According to the information in CBS it was nominated and scheduled back then also. If there is more information or questions, please let me know. Thank you.
