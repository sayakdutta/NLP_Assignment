 estimate for the RCR.

 Robin Gibbs called and said that he agreed that we should intervene and 
 support Mirant on the ISO credit issue.  He said that Mirant's complaint is 
 consistent with the jurisdictional issues that he and Richard have been 
 working on.  Let me know if you would like an RCR estimate.   Ron
