 
 Okay! Real Time has finally drilled down on the problem we were having with 

 sheet to reflect our price. I apologize for the delay in finding the source 
 of the problem, and as it turns out it was just a matter of someone putting 
 the wrong price in the sheet they sent you. Very frustrating, I know, but 
 I've attached the correct sheet nonetheless. Please call or e-mail with 
 questions, and I'm sure I'll hear from you soon!
