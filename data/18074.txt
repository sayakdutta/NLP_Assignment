 week with the heads of the California Chamber and the California 
 Manufacturer's Association, at which we discussed demand buy down, etc. at 
 length.  It was a very positive meeting.  
 
 Stephanie left them with Reliant's Westwide demand exchange program.  And I 
 believe that our folks (Jim?) are meeting with Reliant to discuss it further 
 in D.C.  
 
 I can fax you a copy of what they're walking around if you don't have it.  
 I'll let others chime in, but seems to me that it would be very useful to 
 contact him.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Hey guys.  Are we in communication or working with Reliant in California?  In 
 particular, a guy by the name of  John Stout or a woman (I think she's PR) 
 named Stephanie Newell?  My understanding is that they are shopping a demand 
 exchange idea---in particular in Utah.  I would like to contact him in 
 preparation for the RGA meeting in Los Angeles, but wanted to check with you 
 all first to see what we might already be doing with them.
