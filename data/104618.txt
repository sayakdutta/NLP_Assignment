 and he apparently took none of my suggestions.  Sara
 
 
     
 Sara,
 
 Per my last e-mail on the Papeis Inapa deal, herewith for your complete 
 information a copy of the final form of Deemed ISDA Confirmation very 
 helpfully drwan up by Edmund Cooper in London to document the trade between 
 EEFT (for ECTRIC) and Papeis Inapa.
 
 May be when you get a few minutes, we can have a chat just to confirm the 
 Enron entities involved in paper deals in Europe as there appear to be 
 certain people in London who are a little confused on this issue.
 
 Kind regards
 
 Mark

 Tom,
 
 Here's the final version, subject to:
 
 1. Need to insert the Trade Date at the top of page 2
 2. Need to insert the Houston deal number.
 
 Let me know if you have any queries.
 
 Regards, Edmund.
