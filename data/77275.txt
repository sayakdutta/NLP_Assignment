 
 I don't know what I have in mind.  Austin?  Palacios?  
 
 I'm still struggling with the concept that if we see my parents for a 
 holiday, we have to include your mom, or vice versa.  That just wasn't how it 
 worked in our family growing up - we typically spent holidays with one or the 
 other, rarely with both. I'm trying to figure out the rules.
 
 I haven't heard from St Francis yet.

 I would think so. What do you have in mind?
 
 Anything from St F? I haven't followed up with after school care there. I
 don't have the information they sent. Do you?
 
 
     
 
 Here's a question.  If we have Thanksgiving dinner in Houston with your
 mom, would we have flexibility to do something afterwards?
 
 Just checking...
