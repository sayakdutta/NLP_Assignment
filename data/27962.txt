 a tour, but well-intentioned ideas like that always backfire with the media.

 Attached is a letter Larry DeRoin and I sent to the Omaha World-Herald in 
 response to Tuesday's Mike Kelley column rehashing the Enron move from 
 Omaha.  We think it is important to make sure the World-Herald recognizes 
 that we are still here.
 
 
 
 We don't know if it will be printed, but it felt good to write it.
