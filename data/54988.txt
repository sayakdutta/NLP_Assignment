 Thanx for visiting my web site!
 
 Let me know if there is any progress on your front.
 
 Also, I know we talked about several dates around early november, up to now
 it seems like the 9th would be a candidate... If you could choose one (a
 friday if you can) I would make all the necessary arrangement. A lot of
 people here are very anxious to meet you... your reputation precedes you! If
 you could be free for a diner on the evening preceeding the presentations,
 or on the day of the presentation I could set up a time table.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 
 Pierre-Philippe Ste-Marie
