 For those of you who have continued to participate in your Corporate Responsibility Task Force subcommittee since the task force was folded into the Culture Committee, thanks for your continuing help.  And for those of you who have not participated lately, we are asking you to join us once more for a final meeting.  As you recall, the subcommittees are:
 
 Asset-related Activities 
 External Accountability 
 Internal Communication and Accountability 
 Market Opportunity 
 Measurement and Benchmarking 
 
 
 The subcommittee goals are attached: 
 
 <<CRTFgoals.doc>> 
 I would like to pull together everyone who has been involved over the past year in the Corporate Responsibility initiative for a final review of all subcommittee recommendations.  Subcommittee chairs will then take these recommendations to Ken Lay and the policy committee, so we want to make sure that our final product accurately reflects the input that all of you have had this year.
 
 Please identify your preferred dates (listed below), and respond to Stacy Walker via e-mail or at 713-853-3583.  The meeting should last less than one hour.
 
 Thanks; look forward to seeing everyone again.
