 Sherri - Rebecca says to put her down for $500...and you can put me down for $25...I'm always glad to have made these contributions when I'm doing my taxes and I just finished that little exercise!!!  Loretta
 
  
     
 I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you!
 
 Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?
 
 Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...
 
 Sherri :-)
