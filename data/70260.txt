 i faxed comments on the CA and note to Heather at Bracewell earlier today. 
 Would like to see copies of the LLC Agreement and the propsed guaranty. 
 
 Who from tax and accounting is reviewing this deal?
 
 Is there a reason for member guaranties rather than equity funding agreements 
 or note purchase agreements or any other structure?
 
 
 Is a DASH/GASH prepared?
 
 Who in legal handled the formation of the Enovate entity? [just in case I had 
 questions about structure, etc.]
