 
 Jim,
 
 Thanks for your message.
 
 We definitely plan to visit with you, as planned, next Wednesday.
 We shall be flying from San Jose in the morning and we can shoot for
 9:30 a.m. arrival at your office, as long as it works for you.
 
 I shall forward your message to our lawyer and ask her to
 come up with a new version of an NDA.
 
 Look forward to meeting you next week.
 
 Vince
 
  
     
 Vince,
 
 Since we agreed in our conference call that we have not exchanged any
 confidential or proprietary technical information up to this time and do
 not expect to need to exchange such information in our next meeting
 (your visit to Santa Fe) we would prefer not to sign an NDA covering
 technical information at this time.
 
 We would be happy to sign an NDA covering the content of the business
 discussion itself.  We are happy to refrain from revealing to others
 that we are talking to you and/or revealing any details about our
 possible business relationship.  We would be happy to provide you with
 such an NDA if you would like or you can draft one and present it to us.
 
 We will move forward under the assumption that you agree with the
 above.  Please contact me if you do not.
 
 Given events in Enron that were announced today are we still on for the
 5th and will Greg still be coming?
