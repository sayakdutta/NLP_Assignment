 We have no plans for Easter -- other than the fact that Alina is scheduled to be baptized at 8:30 AM church.  The Plaza/Houston/Met clubs have an Easter brunch that looks like it could be fun.  On the other hand we could just relax pool side.  We'd love to spend the day with you and gimpy.  Just let me know your leisure preferences.  
 
 
 
 
     
 
 Hi. How was your weekend? I hope you had a nice visit with your guests. 
 
 As you can imagine I spent most of the weekend caring for John. He actually
 slept quite a bit on Saturday but I thought I should stick around in case he
 needed something. Yesterday, he started to get a little more mobile but it
 is going to be a while before he is "back on his feet." He did go to work
 today and starts physical therapy today as well.
 
 I hope to see you all sometime soon. What are your plans for Easter?
