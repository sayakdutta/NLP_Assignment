 Please read paragraph 2 of the Termination confirmation.
 
 It refers to the terminated transaction having "Reference number 1980816".
 
 The confirmation that you  sent to me (for the terminated transaction) has a Reference number 1980815.  The termination confirmation is referenced as 1980816.
 
 You need to correct paragraph 2 of the Termination confirmation. Then the document can be executed.
 
 Please let me know if you have further questions.
