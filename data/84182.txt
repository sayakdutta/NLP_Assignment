 before to handle this from Crescendo's perspective.  I will coordinate from 
 ENA's perspective.  I am working with Teresa on this issue.

 Can you review the PSA on Crescendo's behalf, or is this something Teresa 
 Bushman or outside counsel should review?

 I received the proposed PSA for the Wildhorse acquisition from Petrie
 Parkman today.  I have attached for everyone's review.  We are required to
 send back to TBI with proposed changes with our proposal.
 
 Mark, would you please forward to those who need to see it besides Audrey
 and Gerald.
 Thx
 
 Ken Krisa
