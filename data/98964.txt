 heard the prel. hearing. An associate judge--Brent Burg-- heard the prelim. 
 hearing

 before I go asking around, it would be helpful to know what judge it is.
 
 squires is wonderful.  judge probably sustained b/c objections were good.
 he would be my first choice.
 
 tell me asap who is the judge.
 
 
     
 
 
 As we discussed, Linda's divorce is in Judge Squires' court. The opposing
 counsel is Susan Myres, who I think has recently moved to Don
 Fullenwiller's firm. She presents a problem for two reasons. First,she is
 much,much more aggressive than Linda's current atty. At the prelimanary
 hearing, she objected to half of the question, which the judge sustained(he
 has asked to withdraw and I say good riddance)  The bigger problem in my
 mind is that her aggression has "empowered" Linda's husband. It is pretty
 pathetic from what Linda tells me. He says things like"wait till I tell my
 lawyer about this, she'll go straight to the judge" Linda needs someone
 that knows what they are doing, is aggressive enough to handle Ms.Myres,
 and has some clout with the Judge. Linda can pay,but has limited resources.
 Thanks for your help.
