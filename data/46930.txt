 At the request of Bob Shults, I am attaching our proposed form of Letter of 
 Interest.  In addition, although we feel our current discussions are covered 
 by the Non-Disclosure Agreement between our affiliate Enron Europe Limited 
 and GFI Group, Inc., we would like to enter into a Non-Disclosure Agreement 
 directly between GFI and EnronOnline and Enron Net Works due to the ongoing 
 nature of our discussions.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please 
 sign the enclosed documents and return them to me via fax (713) 646-3490.  I 
 will have them executed by Enron.  If you have any comments or questions, 
 please do not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3399.
