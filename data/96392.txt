 Elizabeth,
 Below is the one comment from Pacificorp on the CA that I had marked up.  I 
 am attaching the markup I had sent to Pacificorp.  Prior to sending execution 
 copies I thought you might want to look at it in light of the fact that the 
 contingent call option portion of the proposed transactions would likely be a 
 physical deal with EPMI.  I am taking the next two days off but will be back 
 on Monday.

 Glad to help.
 Only need one change; I don't have Brent's e-mail address, but  I'll trust 
 Sanjeev to forward this:
  
 In Section 2, where it says:
 "at the time of disclosure or is thereafter  acquired from a source other 
 than the Disclosing Party that was not known  to"
 add a comma between "acquired" and  "from".
  
 




   Jeremy: 
 Can you review draft CA with  Enron for work pertaining to the hydro, thermal 
 and load hedges? Please work  with Enron lawyer, Brent Hendry (713)853-7124. 
 As always your help is  appreciated.
