 eager to talk--please give me a call at 402-398-7449 at your convenience.  
 I'm in and available after 3:30 today and basically all day tomorrow.  After 
 that, Monday and Tuesday are relatively infested with meetings and I head out 
 on a short vacation on Wed.  I look forward to talking to you.  DF 
 
 
 
 

   
  
 
 Drew;
 I'd love to talk with you and get the power plant deal off the ground.  Can
 you give me some times when I can reach you for a discussion?

 Yup, went over to the dark side.  On the power plant, I've got a couple of
 guys you need to talk to.  Steve Harris is VP of marketing at TW, and Kevin
 Hyatt is his right hand guy.  Steve is at 713-853-1796 and I'm not sure
 what Hyatt's # is.  Give me a call and I'll tell you what I can about what
 we're doing to help site power plants.  When did you go out-house?  I don't
 think I've run into you since you were running around with Shoneman.
 Adios, DF.

 Drew;
 Congratulations on your new job. I didn't realize that you had joined  the
 pipelines.
 I've got a client interested in developing a power plant in Arizona off
 Transwestern. Can you give me a good contact at Transwestern?
 Regards,
 George Briden
