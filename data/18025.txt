 
 FYI.  Presentation by Brattle Group before CA leg committee yesterday in 
 which they assert market power at the CA border (held by "out-of-state 
 suppliers") explains high gas prices in California.  If you have any 
 questions, call me at 415.782.7822.  Please forward to others whom you think 
 might be interested.  Stephanie, could you forward along to Barry?
 
 Best,
 Jeff
