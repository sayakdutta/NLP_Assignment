 Your counterparty is being impossible.  Please see their latest message below.  They won't even send us their draft ISDA until we provide them with every little bit of info.  This is only a draft, not the final one.  It can and probably will be negotiated.
 
 Thanks!

 Our legal department is reviewing the guarantee.  We would like to send you
 out an ISDA schedule as quickly as possible, but in order to set appropriate
 terms our credit department would like a bit more information on ECT
 Investment.  Specifically the types, size and frequency of anticipated
 trades.  Any color you could offer would be helpful. Thanks again.
 
 Rgds,

 Enron Corp. does not give unlimited guaranties.  The amount will be
 determined by our Credit Department based upon the credit in your draft
 ISDA.

    Marie,
 
    One more quick question.  In line 1 (b) below in the guaranty, the cap
    amount of the guarantee was left blank.  Is Enron willing to not cap the
    guaranty amount, or does this term still need to be negotiated?  Thanks,
 
     - Lissa
 
    "1 (b)  The aggregate amount covered by this Guaranty shall not exceed
    U.S.
    $________."
 
    
                 
 
    Lissa:
 
    I must be having problems with my e-mail as I tried to reply to yours
    and was told it couldn't be delivered, so that's why I'm sending you a
    new one rather than a reply.
 
    Attached is the proposed form of guaranty that Enron Corp. will provide.
    ECT Investments would only collateralize above the threshold, since you
    would have a guaranty for the rest.
 
    We look forward to receiving your schedule.
