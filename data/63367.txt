    Human Scale
 
 
 Dear Dr. Lay:
 
 New this week on www.TheGlobalist.com:
 
 RUDI DORNBUSCH ON INCOME INEQUALITY
 Poverty is bad -- but income inequality is not. MIT Professor Rudi
 Dornbusch makes the argument that the development community
 should not confuse inequality with poverty -- even though at the
 bottom they might feel the same.
 
 Coming Monday: A New Globalist Paper
 PRICING AIDS MEDICATIONS TO A HUMAN SCALE
 In a scramble for good publicity, pharmaceutical companies have
 started a downward bidding war in pricing AIDS medications for
 African markets. To add a much-needed measure of fairness to
 the process, we propose a better alternative -- adjusting the price
 of treatment to per-capita GDP.
 
 Best regards from Washington,

 CHINA'S CARIBBEAN ISLAND HIDEAWAY

 it has few economic or political ties?

 countries have to gain by forming a strategic alliance?
