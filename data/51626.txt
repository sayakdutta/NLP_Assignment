 Attached is the revised Risk Management Policy incorporating the BOD's 
 changes - please discard the previously circulated version I sent out prior 
 to the BOD meeting.  I've also included a recap of substantive changes since 
 the October 2000 version that was circulated to you in conjuction with the 
 compliance certificates last fall, but you should read the policy to enhance 
 your understanding, and distribute it to your groups as some changes are 
 significant and are detailed further in the policy.  I did notify the Office 
 of the Chair for each of your business units of these changes earlier this 
 week, and I will also provide them with a copy of the revised policy.  
 
 
 If you have any questions, feel free to give me a call at x 30429.
 
 Regards,
 Cassandra Schultz
