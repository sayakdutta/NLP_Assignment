 
 I am going to be the Senior Regulatory Counsel at ISO New England starting on 
 April 9, 2001.   My last day in the Portland area will be March 31, 2001.  I 
 enjoyed working with you and wish you the best of everything.  I'm having a 
 pot luck at my house Friday, if you and Steve want to come over. 
 
 My new address will be:
 
 Mary Hain
 Senior Regulatory Counsel
 ISO New England Inc.
 One Sullivan Road
 Holyoke, MA  01040-2841
 (413) 535-4000
