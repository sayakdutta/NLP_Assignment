 Dear Mike,
 
 Thank you for taking the time to meet with me this afternoon in spite of your 
 busy schedule.  Your encouragement is appreciated, especially in light of the 
 uncertainties resulting from the substantial shift in Enron's business 
 paradigm.  I look forward to communicating with the individuals you 
 suggested--in particular, Randy Maffett, Per Seska, Mark Tawney, and Eric 
 Gonzales.
 
 As you requested, attached below is my resume.
 
 Best regards,
 Manuel
