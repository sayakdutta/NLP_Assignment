 
 For this list of amends, my comments mean:
 
 Cinergy-already had them open for financial & power, Credit's changes should 
 have no impact on my prior approvals.
 Dynegy Power Marketing-shut them down for financial (& Argentina gas)
 Nui Energy Brokers-already had them open for all financial, OK with Credit's 
 changes.
