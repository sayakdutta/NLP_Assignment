 
 Just to clarify - you are booked in the Mt. Bachelor conference room for your 
 Monday morning staff meetings, 9 to 10:15 a.m., from now until this time next 
 year. Hopefully this will eliminate any last minute confusion like what we 
 ran into this morning. If you have any other questions, please let Mollie or 
 myself know and we'll address them as quickly as possible.
 
 Thank you - 
 Kate Symes
