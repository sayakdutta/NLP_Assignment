 Kay,
 
 Attached for your review is a preliminary draft of Purchase Agreement
 between Enron North America, Inc. and TECO Power Services Corporation
 relating to the membership interests in Midway Development Company, LLC.
 Please contact John Keffer or me with your comments when you have a moment.
 
 By the way, it's great to be back at K&S, and I look forward to working with
 you again.
