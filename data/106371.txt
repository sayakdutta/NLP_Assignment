 
 Karolina and Rod:
 
 This swap has ended up on my desk!  Imagine that.
 
 This transaction ought to be booked between RMT and ETOL.  The existing ISDA 
 Master Agreement from December 31, 1998 is between Enron Capital & Trade 
 Resources Corp. and ETOL.  We need to create an RMT/ETOL ISDA Master 
 Agreement for this 3-year rate swap.
 
 Is ETOL prohibited from entering into swaps with other parties, such as RMT 
 (under the terms of the lending documents)?
 
 Please bring me up to date.  Thanks.
