 I would expect that I (I use Bruce), Scot, John McGreevy and Sam Behrens 
 would likely be involved.  Sam is an energy lawyer familiar with nuclear 
 facilities and would be helpful with background issues.
 

 
 Paul:
 Did you mean to refer to dates in June?  Alos, could you let me know which
 persons or persons will be handling the areas that we need covered as so
 far I am only aware of you and Scott and i wasn't sure if others would be
 involved.  Thanks.
 Carol

 I will be away from the office on business from the evening of Friday, May
 12th, returning on Monday, May 22nd.  During this period, I will not have
 email access for a portion of the trip and there may, therefore, be a delay
 in my responding to emails sent during this period.
