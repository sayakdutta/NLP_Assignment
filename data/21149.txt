 We have been asked to put together a list of home addresses for the executive 
 committee to be distributed only among its members in connection with holiday 
 greeting card distribution.  If you have no problem being included on this 
 list, please forward your home address to me by return email. 
 
 Thank you, 
 Katherine Brown
