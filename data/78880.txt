 
 Since Bryan Hull works as an analyst at my desk I would like to discuss the "no" feedback with him.  Please let me know when it is appropriate to do so.

 All,
 
 Thank you for your time yesterday interviewing for the ENA Trading Track.    I would be grateful if you would not discuss feedback with any of the candidates until all offers are confirmed.  I will advise you when candidates have been notified.
 
 Thanks once again.
 
 Regards,
 
 Karen.
