 Just wanted to let you guys know that Southwest has vacation specials to New Mexico right now.  I priced up a 4 day/ 3 night trip with air/hotel/car to Albuquerque (we'd have to drive to Sante Fe...not bad, I've done it) and it came out to about $255 a person.  Personally, I think this is a really good price.  I was just wondering if there was genuine interest in taking this trip and if so what the best time would be to go.  We could also check on getting flights from LA for Kasey and Jen.  Anyway, drop me a line when you guys get a chance and let me know if I need to keep doing more research.  I was figuring we could leave in a Thursday and come back on a Sunday.
 
 Talk to you soon,
 Sue
