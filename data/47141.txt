 Pls see below - I did answer you specifically about WAPA. I am OK to open 
 them for trading in the West.
 
 I don't know what CRSP means - maybe Credit does...

 With respect to Western Area Power Administration - CRSP.  Can't "ditto" 
 Credit on that one, Credit gives no direction as to what they want to trade.  
 The database reflects that Leslie approved them to trade power already in 
 July of last year, so my intention is to keep them open.  I don't know what 
 "CRSP" means at the end of their name, do you?
