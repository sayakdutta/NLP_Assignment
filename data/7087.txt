 Three interesting things.  
  
 1.  The Steer Starletts Fundraiser we think is  going on this Thursday night.  It is a very good Rodeo social  event.  Lots of honies, free drinks and free food.  I will keep you  posted.  I should find out for sure today that it is going on.
  
 2.  The Rodeo Kickoff dance is going on next  Wednesday the 16th.  You and Travis are invited to come with me if ya'll  would like.  Or meet me somewhere in the area.  It starts at 7:30 or  something like that.
  
 3.  On Friday night some of us are going to  the Firehouse to celebrate Barbara Prukop's 35th birthday.  Ya'll are  invited to that also.
  
 So let me know something about joining us for any  of the above social events.
