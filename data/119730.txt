 
 if it doesn't work out next week -we can do it another time as well
 
 
  
     
 Leslie will be here next week (Tues & Wed).  She'll probably be getting in too late for lunch on Tuesday.  If you're here on Wednesday, I'll check and see if she would be available.  She usually gets scheduled up pretty heavy when she's here, but I haven't checked on her schedule for Wednesday.  I know she and I have a lot to go through.
 
  
     
 I f there is nothing new to discuss we can cancel but I would like to know what is on the Commisssion's Agenda for next when you get it.  Thanks.  Also, the next time Leslies come to town, maybe we can all go to lunch.
 
  
     
 Janie - are you planning to have the West Desk Regulatory Meeting tomorrow at 2:30?  I don't have anything of substance to talk about, unless FERC puts the El Paso proceedings on the agenda for next week.
