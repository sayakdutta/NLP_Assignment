 We'll see if they had time to arrange it.  If not we will follow up after.
 
 Regards,

  I have not spoken to anyone since we discussed doing this together.  I asked 
 John G. to join the call with the lenders tomorrow.

 I am going to talk with them tomorrow at 8:30 CST.  You can join if you 
 like.  Have you talked to Brad or Sue at S&W?
