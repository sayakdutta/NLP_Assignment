 I looked anyway on this floor.  I just sent out an email regarding the 
 location.  I better call Defner and Miller and let them know the location.

 At the time I asked you to set it up I did not not the Joe Defner and Mike J 
 Miller would be attending.
 
 
    
  
 There isn't one up here, I looked yesterday. I'll look elsewhere.  Please 
 tell me when you ask me to set up the meeting if you will need a conference 
 room.

 Please see if you can get a conference room for the 300 call.  If there isn't 
 one here, try 28 or 29.  Thanks, Kay
