 
 ECT Investments, Inc. ("ECTI") entered into a 5-YEAR credit derivative with 
 Deutsche Bank ("DB") effective 7/19/00 with a Scheduled Termination Date of 
 7/19/05 (Loews Corporation is the reference credit).  DB is requiring an 
 Enron Corp. guaranty.  There is no mention of guaranty terms.  [NOTE THAT IN 
 A SIMILAR DEAL 3/13/00 BASED UPON THE REPUBLIC OF INDONESIA  BETWEEN THE 
 PARTIES, NO GUARANTY WAS REQUESTED].
 
 Should  ECTI post the guaranty?  Do we want a Master ISDA?
 
 Please let me know.  Thanks.  Sara
