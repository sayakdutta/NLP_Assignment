 I think the price of the turbines will be the internal Enron price.  Sheila 
 has the magic number per turbine.

 I tried to reach you on the phone a couple of times but the phone is busy 
 (must be the Compaq battery).
 
 I would like to speak with Kay before calling Kent and think your idea of 
 posting the summary with a [to come] for the price is a fine idea.   I would, 
 however, suggest that Kent review the summary not for accuracy but for 
 content prior to posting.  I believe that this is consistent with the deal 
 that Sheila cut with him.
 
 By the way, I heard from Don Miller that the following companies have 
 expressed an interest in LV CoGen: Southern, Allegheny, Pinnacle West, El 
 Paso, NRG, Calpine, AEP, PECO, and Dynegy  (this should be kept confidential)
