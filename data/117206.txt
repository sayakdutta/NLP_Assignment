 Buenos Aires?  I'm not sure we have much to tell them at this stage - 
 actually, I'm sure I don't have anything new to report but if you do that 
 would be fine with me.

 Michael and myself are planing to be in Hoston on Thursday and Friday of this 
 week. We intend to see as many people as possible regarding EOL 
 implementation. We will meet Dave Forster and his team among others. We would 
 like to fit a meeting with you as a group or individually. 
 Please let me know about your availability and if it is possible to meet with 
 more than one of you in one place.
 Thank you
