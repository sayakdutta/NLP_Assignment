 
 Tony,
 
      Attached is my response to your RFP on behalf of Noresco.  As noted in our conversation earlier today, I apologize for the tardiness of my response.  I do hope that you will consider our proposals along with the other responses that you received.  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at 713-853-0685.  
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Kim Ward
 Manager, West Gas Origination
