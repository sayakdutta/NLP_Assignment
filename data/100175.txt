 Hi Jim
  
 Hope work is going ok with all the changes taking place there.
  
 Just wanted to let you know we have been looking at cars.  
  
 We asked the kids what they thought.  They really like the SUV's. 
  
 I think another mini-van would be great as far as room to move around as well as having 7 places to sit, but the kids are a little more interested in what looks "cool".         : )
  
 There are a couple midsize suv's that now have a third seat (although the seat it is closer to the ground).  That might be a good compromise.(?)
  
 Anyway, it sure is FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! to look.  
  
 Thanks for being there for us!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  
 Let me know if you have any thoughts on the process.
  
 Love and Hugs
  
 Linda
