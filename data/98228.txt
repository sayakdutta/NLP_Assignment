 a great fit because of his lack of legal experience. Typically, we don't hire 
 first year lawyers unless there is a person who is willing to sponser(train) 
 them. I know Barbara has been very pleased with Gerald Nemec, so her feelings 
 might have changed about hiring someone so inexperienced. However, I know  
 that Mark H. and Jim Derrick will be very skeptical.
