 Kay,
 
 Please have the appropriate managing directors and officers of CAED I
 and CAED II execute the attached resignations and return the executed
 resignations to Doug Pedigo.  If any other persons were manging
 directors or officers of CAED I or CAED II prior to closing, please have
 them execute similar resignations and furnish them to Doug.  Thanks.
 
 George
