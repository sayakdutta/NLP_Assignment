 
 This looks like it belongs in the specs.  What do you think?

 Sorry in the earlier transmittal I was interrupted and sent the message by 
 mistake.  The red text below is what I added to insure that the minimum 
 design standards are satisfied.  From the discussion this morning, the 
 sensing instruments should or must be rated class I, div 2 and Fuelcell was 
 not willing to state that minimum was included in their design basis.  The 
 wording below should bring closure to this issue, when placed in the contract.

 Mike:
 
 This is the recommended verbiage to address area classification issues:
 
 The electrical system design and installation shall be in compliance with the 
 requirement of NFPA 70 (NEC), in particular, Article 500 with respect to 
 Hazardous Locations.  The classification of locations shall be as recommended 
 by API RP 500 (Recommended Practice for Classification of Locations for 
 Electrical Installations at Petroleum Facilities.)  The design compliance 
 with the NFPA requirements shall be demonstated in a design review or HAZOP 
 review meeting which includes representatives of Enron North America in the 
 review process.
 
 Regards,
 
 Dom
