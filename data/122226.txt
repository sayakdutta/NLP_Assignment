 
 Kevin,
 
 We are putting a list together for lost value for all of TW including the Trans Pecos project.  We will get this to you by the end of the day.  If your timing is different than this, please let me know.  
 
 Talk to you soon,
 Kim.
 
  
     
 Kim:
 If TW was to be included in the Cpt 11 process, what would you guess would be the lost value relative to TransPecos? I am pulling together a list of "Lost Value" items across the board to determine total value erosion of all the pipelines if this happens.
