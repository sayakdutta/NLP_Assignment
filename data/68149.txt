 
 unfortunately, I do not have any information about these deals.  With these being IT day deals, the schedulers and traders will have all of your information.  sorry.

 I am not sure if they have confirmed either deal.  However, deal #1034254 was never pathed by us, whereas 1027152 was.  Therefore, nothing billed out under 1034254.
 
 Bonnie - I am including you on this note in case you can add anything about the pathing of the two deals mentioned in this note.  Niether CMS orgaination shows anything on Trunkline that matches this.  We spoke briefly about this last week.
 
 Phillip - I am including you in case you can add any clarity or determine who we did this deal(s) with.
 
 Thank you,

 Tom,
 
 In contacting our scheduler and subsequently a CMS scheduler, neither CMS Field Services nor CMS Marketing, Services, and Trading are able to identify the deal.  Currently, I am preparing to fax a copy of our confirmation on the deal to CMS Field Services,  Again, it is not an executed copy, but I am assuming they may not have sent it back.  Furthermore, the CMS Field Services scheduler has told me that they don't even schedule any Trunkline deals.
 
 Considering all of this, I am assuming the worst - that unless we can provide a trader name etc. they will short pay on this deal.  So, do you know who represented us with CMS on this deal any one that might know who their trader is or how this deal was booked?  We are getting ready to settle for Sep prod so any help asap would be appreciated.

 They do not recognize that deal at all.
 
 The most recent name and number is a Conoco trader.  I have a confirmation on this deal with CMS.  However, it is not an executed copy (i.e. sent back or confirmed by CMS).  Is there some one who represented us with CMS on this that might know who their trader is or how this deal was booked?  I will attempt to contact the scheduler in the mean time but any help would be good.
 
 thanks.
 
  
     
 I never talk to these people so the numbers I have are old. Do they not recognize this deal?  It was scheduled so I assume the counterparty is correct. I have another number for Mike at 281-293-2203.  It could be old also.
 
  
     
 Tom,
 
 The below number is for a Duke Energy trader.  So, either this deal is booked wrong or this is not the correct trader name.  Please advise.

 Tom,
 
 Please inform me of the CMS Field Services trader on deal #1027152 plus any additional information that you might have.
 
 Thank you,
