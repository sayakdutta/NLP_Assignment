 
 I got your note and relayed it to Linda.  Our prayers are with you.
 
  
     
 Thank you for relaying the message.
 We are all riveted to the news as well.  From a window down the hall, I saw the second trade tower collapse.  It is truly horrible.  Many people have left the office, but those who live outside of Manhattan are stuck here.  I'm still here, waiting to hear the whereabouts of my husband who was en route to court in Brooklyn this morning, before walking home to the upper west side.
 Be well.
 

 Hi Kayalyn - Linda asked me to forward this - I'm at my company's office
 in London.
 
 Am unable to call NYC from London - all lines busy.  I received your fax
 and it looks fine.  I don't understand the last sentence of section 6.3
 because of the cross reference to section 10.3.  Please check the cross
 reference to section 10.3.  Thanks.
 
 Linda
