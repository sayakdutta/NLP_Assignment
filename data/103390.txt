 
 Marie:  I would like to schedule a meeting with you and others to review the 
 agreement process, your contacts, account information, record retention 
 (physical files and Lotus Notes), reporting procedures, any forms which you 
 have developed and helpful tips.  I know that you are working on a memo which 
 will address this information and it would be extremely helpful if we could 
 learn from your experience. I would also like to discuss Ted Murphy's 
 expectations.  I think this will take about an hour.  Please give me a 
 suggested time during the week.  Thanks.  Sara
