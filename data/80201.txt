 I am looking to see if TWPL is close to the two wells that are about to
 drilled. I work with Lori Vining at Beacon Petroleum and I am trying to find
 Pipelines in the area.
 The areas are:
 
 Eddy County, New Mexico - SE/4 of SECT 20  23S-27E.
 Winkler County, Texas - Center of SECT 22 - B3 Public School Land
 
 I went out to the Point catalog and looked up the counties to see what was
 in the area and found some information, but I was just wanting to make sure
 I get it right.
 
 I would appreciate any help.
 
 Thank you for time,
