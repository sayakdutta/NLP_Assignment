 We are in touch with Ketra and John and we shall work with them when they are 
 here.

 Mark:
 
 F.Y.I. - I have been informed by Ketra that she plans to be in the Houston 
 office on Monday September 18th through Wednesday September 20th to meet with 
 Vince and Stinston.  
 
 Hopefully we will be ready to continue Phase I of the Forecasting Project.  
 Can you make arrangements with Vince and Stinson (hopefully they will be 
 available to meet!).
 
 Thanks!
