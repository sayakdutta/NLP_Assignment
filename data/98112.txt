 Richard, we have located charts prepared by someone at ECT indicating that
 ECT held on to 11,750 units of the "B" NSM notes.  The Offering Memorandum
 indicates that ECT was to purchase 12,210 units of the B notes.  Thus, it
 appears that some 500 units were "sold." We would like to discuss the charts
 with Travis or Kevin (during the visit to Houston - if not before).
 
 Thanks.
 
 
     
 
 
 
 Have you received all the information you need?

 Just a reminder -- As discussed during our conference call this past Friday,
 we are hoping to receive from you a chart or other documentation reflecting
 what ECT did with the "B" NSM Notes that were purchased.  Thanks.
