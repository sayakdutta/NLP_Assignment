 Mike,
 
 Can you join us on Wednesday morning, November 15 to play golf at Canyon 
 Springs golf course in San Antonio prior to the Enron Management Conference? 
 Canyon Springs will allow us to book a 10:00am tee time thirty days in 
 advance. Once I have confirmed the tee time I will forward directions to the 
 course. Should be a fun group. Might even need a practice round at Champions 
 prior to the trip. 
 
 Doug
