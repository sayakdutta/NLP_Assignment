 who is in the office late!  I was told that the memo would come out today - 
 you just had to be here at dinner time to see it!  I am really pleased about 
 how we have been able to improve the perception of what our group does and 
 its importance to the organization.  And yes, we need more female names on 
 these lists!  --Sally 
 
 

 
    
 Congratulations on your promotion!  What a great statement to how far you 
 have brought Energy Operations.   I'm sure your team will be excited to see 
 your efforts recognized.  Also, it is very encouraging to see a female name 
 on the list.  Best of luck!
