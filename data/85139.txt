 enjoyable,  challenging.  First Eric's wife got sick Friday night and wasn't 
 able to go out the whole weekend.  Next, my car battery completely died when 
 I arrived at my friends house in Austin.  I replaced the battery and 
 everything was fine.  Eric, I,  and my friend proceeded to Maggie Maes to see 
 the band Pale (the whole point of our trip, right!).  We arrived at Maggie 
 Maes and asked which level Pale was playing on and were informed they had 
 cancelled.  Great.  Oh well we had a good time that night anyway.  Cool.   
 Then, driving back to Houston and coming up upon the Beltway I noticed that 
 my temp gauge needle was buried deep into the danger zone.  I had to have the 
 car towed back into downtown.  Anyway, it was an interesting trip.
