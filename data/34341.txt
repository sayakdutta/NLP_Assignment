 
 I forgot to mention that my goal today is to have the Northeast transport 
 split out by East and Marketeast.

 Colleen,
  
 I'll get that info to you as soon as Chris Germany finishes revamping the 
 East demand worksheets.
 
 Thanks,
 Crystal

 No need to give it to me without that info--just get me a copy once you've 
 reconstructed the spreadsheets.

 Colleen,
 
 I am unable to complete the Transport P&L for the Northeast Desk due to 
 reconstruction on the spreadsheets where I gather my demand 
 charges/reimbursements data. If you would like me to do the Transport P&L 
 without that info, just let me know and I'll get that to you as soon as 
 possible.
 
 Thanks,
 Crystal Hyde
