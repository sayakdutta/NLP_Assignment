 We must go after this. I need some specific direction with exactly what you would like us to have our clients do. I see this as breaking our market down into the following as each are effected a bit differently:
 
 - a specific alignment with the contracts we signed in August
 
 - those clients we are marketing to, and can't sign a new contract due to the suspension
 
 - existing clients whom we are risk with if there are ANY restrictions on extensions
 
 Suggest that we set-up a call on Mon or Tues. Would like myself, Angela Schwarz, Lamar Frazier, David Cox, Gayle Muench and Michael Mann in attendance
