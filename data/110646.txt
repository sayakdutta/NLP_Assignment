 
 Team,
 
 The attached spreadsheet identifies the manual entry points for each pipeline.  Please send me additional points for your respective pipelines and highlight in green.  Make particular note of any information that will be tracked on a schedule other than the standard cycle schedule of the relative pipeline.  The blue highlighted meters already exist in the database.  Where appropriate add the IHS DRN.  If it does not exist, leave blank and the IT group will create an ID using the description provided.  Please let me know if you cannot get this done by the end of the day, since I'd like Hyde to incorporate these first thing tomorrow.  Call me if you have any questions.
