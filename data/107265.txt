 Sara,
 
 As discussed, attached are all of the Contract Review forms for the Financi=
 al Liquids contracts that we were asked to review this weekend for Ed Smida=
 .   Nony will also send you a copy of the list of other Financial Liquid co=
 ntracts that we have been asked to review.  I agree that we need to coordin=
 ate this work so that we are not duplicating efforts.  If you have any sugg=
 estions or if your group is already reviewing any of the contracts that we =
 have been asked to look at, please let me know.  Thanks.

 Weezie:
 
 Please email the names of any financial counterparties which you have revie=
 wed on behalf of global markets to Susan, Stephanie and Samantha.  Such cou=
 nterparties may have been previously reviewed for a different financial pro=
 duct and we do not want to create multiple files or conduct multiple review=
 s.
 
 Bob Sevitz is the "gatekeeper" for the data collection process.
 
 Thanks.
