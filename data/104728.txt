 Please keep Bill and I in the loop.  Thanks.
 
 
     
 Tanya:
 
 This year is no different from any other year and we are always asked to 
 review the swap component of the Global Finance structured deals.  We are 
 also seeing lots of prepays.
 
 Who is the credit person to be apprised of these transactions?  Should we 
 immediately involve you and Bill?
 
 At the moment, Mary Cook, Angela Davis (legal finance group) and I are 
 juggling the deals.
 
 Please let me know and I'll alert the swap group.  Thanks.  Sara
