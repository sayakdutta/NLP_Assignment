 Gee, I don't know who to thank for this honor.

 Russell,
 
 Stephanie called yesterday and said this counterparty called EOL and wanted 
 to get opened to trade financial online and get an ISDA in place.
 
 I spoke to Tom Moran about this counterparty this morning to see if we saw 
 them as a swap counterparty before I called them, and Tom told me that he did 
 not think Credit wanted to trade financial with this counterparty.  He asked 
 me to pass the counterparty's name & number on to you so you could give them 
 a call to break the news to them.  The woman who called is named karen and 
 her no. is 713/974-9394.
