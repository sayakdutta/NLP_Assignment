 Janet,
 
 Tried to get through to you but no success so far this afternoon.  I have removed the split from East to West.
 
 Load
 
 Power
 ENA > 10 MW Hourly Peak Demand
 EES < 10 MW Hourly Peak Demand
 
 Gas 
 ENA > 1,000 MMBTUs/day
 EES < 1,000 MMBTUs/day
 
 I am still working on the codes but the issue is that things like Fertilizer companies are not included in the lists so they may cause more confusion tha add value.
 
 Louise
