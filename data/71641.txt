 
 Opps.  I thought we were talking about the same CO.  Could you please send 
 me  a copy (or electronic file) of the letter you are incorporating by 
 reference?
 
 This CO will need to be signed by Janet Dietrich, Managing Director.
 
 Is the replacement N-1 the same as the replacement N-1 in CO #2?
 
 I'll give this the final once over as soon as I get the letter.
 
 Thanks (and sorry for the confusion),
 
 Kay
