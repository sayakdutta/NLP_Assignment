 
 PLEASE take me with you.  I am at a low in my life - recently reassured that I am a failure in relationships that really mean something to me.  The only point in my life where I can't seem to be successful.  
 
  
     
 How are you? Holding on for dear life? I've never needed a sailing trip worse in my life!
