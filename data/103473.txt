 Here's the comparison chart. We've gone as far as we can with SSB. The ball 
 is in the traders' court to look at, and approve, the numbers. I don't know 
 when, if ever, they'll do that. They don't seem as interested as they once 
 were. I think we're more or less on hold waiting for them. SSB is aware of 
 the development and said they will push the traders independently.
 
 My schedule is fairly flexible so let me know when you'd like to meet.
