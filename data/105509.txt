 I have a copy of an "equity swap" between ENE and JEDI SPV I, LLC dated April 
 20, 2000 which wants to be a "forward", and which terminates on Sept. 11, 
 2000. The transaction is for 12,012,804 shares and a Notional USD 
 852,909,084.  
 
 Can you send me a copy of the JEDI LP "forward" which appears on Jill's 
 list?  Is it meant to be the confirm above?
