 Phillip,
 
 Enclosed is the First Amendment for your execution.  I just found out that
 you have been out of the office, so you may not have received the fax of the
 Amendment which I sent to you earlier in the week.  Please review the
 enclosed document and contact me at (512) 370-2836 or Mike Bobinchuck with
 any questions or concerns.  If there are no questions, please sign the
 Amendment and fax it me at (512) 370-2850.  Thanks.
