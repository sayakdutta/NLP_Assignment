 Larry,
 
 Here is the info on the Elizabethtown Suiza that should begin 9/1.  I was not 
 copied on the e mail, but you should have received a notification to flow 
 from JoAnn Lavine.  Utility turn on should be complete by CSC.  Please let me 
 know if serving this site is a problem.
 
 
 
 Thank you!
 
 Susan
