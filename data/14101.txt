 Michelle,
  
 Below is a draft discipline letter for your approval.  It is intended to be used with employees who are determined to be posting to web-based bulleting boards during company hours.
  
 You approved this a year or so ago, but I wanted to run it by you again in case anything has changed.

 NAME,
 
 An investigation has determined that you have participated in discussions on web-based bulletin boards during working hours.  Your comments, posted using company equipment and using a name intended to hide your identity, concerned Enron issues that could possibly be construed as insider information.  This activity is in direct violation of Enron's Code of Ethics. <?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" />
 
 You are to immediately cease this activity and come into compliance with Enron's Code of Ethics. Repeated violations will subject you to further discipline, up to and including termination.
