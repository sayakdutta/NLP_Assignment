 meter 5792 is another meter that is serviced in the Lufkin-Diboll area.

 Eric, I am checking the process now for incorporating all transport revenue 
 due Ed for delivery meters in the Texas region.  The following meters have 
 transport rates attached to them which are above and beyond the matrix rates 
 Ed quotes to Tom.  I believe that we are already capturing all Ed's 
 revenue/Tom's expense for this gas at these meters, but want to be sure of 
 that.   Would you let me know if these are the meters for which we are 
 manually moving around money from Tom to Ed for the residential portion of 
 the Lufkin-Diboll volume?
 
 
 
 I believe that the industrial portion of this volume is included already as 
 part of Ducote's deal, and I believe that the residential portion is volume 
 which you determine and then move from Tom to Ed every month.
 
 Is this right?
 
 
 Heidi
