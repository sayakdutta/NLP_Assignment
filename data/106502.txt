 3:30 Thursday, Central Time happens to fall exactly to the minute on a time 
 when I have to be on the phone with Mark Haedicke and Elizabeth Sager.  I 
 cannot move that time.  Can we go earlier or move it to Friday?  I am trying 
 to get the cases to you as soon as I can. ----cgy
 
  
     
 Christian:  Please mark this time on your calendar to speak with Mark T.:  
 3:30 Houston/1:30 Portland.  We'll call you.
 
 Will Pat Boylston send over 1 or 2 cases for us to review prior to the call?
 
 Thanks.

 Does Mark have time in the afternoon to meet with me and Christian Yoder 
 (Portland - 2 hours earlier than CST)?  The topic is "Washington State 
 PUD's".  I'd schedule about an hour.  Thanks.
