 I believe that the best direct jet service between Houston and Charlotte is via US AIr.  Continental has fewer flights and uses other carriers (unfamiliar to me).
 
 For example:
 
 USAIR #586 departs Houston at 7:50 am and arrives in Charlotte at 11:10 am
 [USAIR#1620 departs Houston at 6:30 pm and arrives in Charlotte at 9:46 pm]
 USAIR #897 departs Charlotte at 5:10 pm and arrives in Houston at 6:59 pm
 
 I am certainly open to other options.  Please advise if there is anything further that I can do.
 
 Regards.  Sara
