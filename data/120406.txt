 Actually, I believe compensation did not properly grant your options at year end and this  grant is to make up for that error.  VPs are handled by executive comp so I don't review or send out that info.  Let me know if you need more info and I'll give you a direct contact.
 
 
  
     
 I just received a letter on some options being granted ( a total of 1400)... at $ 35.00 strike.
