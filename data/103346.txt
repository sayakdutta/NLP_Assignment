 Hi, Trena!  I am working again with Gary's desk now that Shari has moved on 
 to power trading (legal).  My first task has been to reconcile the 
 outstanding Sutton Bridge transactions.  I find three:
 
 (1)  Currency Swap between ECT and Sutton Bridge Financing Ltd:  booked 
 5/22/97 [ 12/31/97 through 6/30/22]
 
 (2)  Currency Swap between ECT and Sutton Bridge Power booked 1/28/97 [ 
 through 4/29/11]
 
 (3)  Currency Swap between "ECT" and "Sutton Bridge" booked 3/29/00 [ through 
 3/31/03].  I have only seen the ticket and not the confirm.
 
 I understand that all swap transactions are to be terminated with the pending 
 Sutton Bridge sale.  Are you terminating these three (3) trades?  Are there 
 others?  What is the third trade which was booked last week (I don't know 
 anything about it)?  Someone should be documenting the termination and 
 payout.  Please let me know ASAP as the lawyers are headed to San Antonio 
 tomorrow.  Thanks.  Sara (X35620)
