 Ladies & Gentlemen:
 
 Here is the spreadsheet that Ken plants to attach to his letter to ONEOK re the Fisher Roc lock-up period.  If this causes anyone any heartburn, please let me know ASAP.  
 Again, I'd like to get out the letter from Ken, with this spreadsheet attached, this afternoon.
 
 Many thanks.
 
 Britt
