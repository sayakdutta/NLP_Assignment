 Dear Dr. Kaminski:
 
 I enjoyed our discussion this morning. It sounds like there is a great deal
 of overlap between Enron business units and my interests. I am very much
 looking forward to meeting you and your colleagues. Thank-you for the
 invitation to interview with your group.
 
 Sincerely,
 Rodney Greene
