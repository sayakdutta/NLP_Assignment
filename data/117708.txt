 
 Hey Marc - I was in New Orleans last week, NYC & DC the week before.  Now 
 back home & ready to relax a bit.  Hope you guys came through the storm ok 
 this morning.  Our cars are stuck in the garage because the alley is filled 
 with downed tree branches.  I'm not even sure who to call to get it cleared 
 out.  Ted got a ride from a friend and I took a cab.  Let's get together soon!
 
 Mark
