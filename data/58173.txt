 
 My comments are attached.  I think the pleading is well written, but, as 
 you'll see from my comments, I believe we should be incorporating more of the 
 arguments from the previous pleading.

 As you may be aware, the Chief Judge informed the parties to the settlement 
 proceeding this afternoon that he intends to recommend to the Commission that 
 it employ the June 19 rate methodology for the refund period from October 2 
 forward.
 
 Attached are draft comments that Sarah Novosel and I propose to submit to the 
 Judge and his legal staff tomorrow.  While we would like to convince the 
 Judge that the June 19 methodology is not appropriate, we also provide a 
 fallback approach.
 
 Please review the comments (they are only 4 pages) and send your comments to 
 us.  We plan to submit the comments tomorrow.
 
 Thanks
 
 Ray and Sarah
