 I am soooo sorry I made a mistake.  My daughter's schedule will allow her to 
 attend Clay Walker - not Def Leppard.
 
 If you still have 2 tickets for February 13 (Clay Walker) I would like to 
 purchase those.
 
 If you still have 4 tickets for March 2 (Martina McBride & Lee Ann Womack) I 
 would like to purchase those.
 
 Sorry for the confusion.
 
 Thank you!!
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Kay,
 
 If you still have 4 tickets for March 2 (Martina McBride & Lee Ann Womack) I 
 would like to purchase those.
 
 Do you mind checking to see if you have 2 tickets for March 1 (Def Leppard), 
 if you do I would like to purchase those also.
 
 Just let me know.
 
 Thanks so much!
