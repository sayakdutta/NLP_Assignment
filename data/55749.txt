 Hi, Dear Vince,
 
 How is everything going?
 
 I wonder if you have had a chance to write me the
 recommendation letter yet.  The application deadline
 is coming up.  If you need any more information for
 writing the letter, please let me know.  Thanks for
 the help.
 
 
 Best Regards,
 
 
 Vincent
