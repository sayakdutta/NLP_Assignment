 Good afternoon Jeff,
 
 Cindy Olson referred me to you, suggesting that you would have the 
 information mentioned below.  Enron University Affairs, Ken Lay, Jeff 
 Skilling, Andy Fastow and Gene Humphrey have been working with Harvard 
 Business School, specifically Chris Bartlett and Meg Wozny of Harvard, on a 
 case study of Enron.  This study is in its last phase and the only 
 'roadblock' is gathering additional information.  In particular, Harvard 
 would like information on the 'size and growth of the risk management group'. 
  
 
 This information will help facilitate drawing an effective comparison of the 
 'old' Enron and the 'new' Enron.  
 
 Let me know if you need any additional information.
 
 Regards,
 
 Cindy Derecskey
