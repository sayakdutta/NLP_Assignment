 
 Attached is a revised LOI for WT1.   I took out all the language concerning 
 materials and equipment obligations incurred by ECS.  After talking with 
 Knippa, I understand that after the sale of the motor to TW, they will be 
 doing all of the installation.  Please review and provide comments.
