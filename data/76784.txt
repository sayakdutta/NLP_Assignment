 With your permission, I will send it to Lee and Kent.  Who else from ENA
 should get a copy?

     <<City of Austin Gas Turbine Agt - Blackline of  83017 v.5 to
 v.7.DOC>>
 
 
       Attached is a blackline of the City of Austin Turbine Agreement
    showing changes made to the version that went to GE on February 12.
 This
    draft includes both Lee's and Eric's changes to Exhibit A, as well as
    the addition of the contacts for notices in Sections 25.1 and 25.3.
 It
    also contains a few minor clean-up items identified by Lisa Bills
 when
    she reviewed LV Cogen (e.g., the definitions of Performance Test
    Certificate and Performance Test Completion Certificate were out of
    order).  To complete the agreement, we will need to include the date
 of
    execution and Exhibit H-2.  I particularly wanted Eric to review this
    before it went to the other side.  If it looks acceptable, I would be
    happy to send a copy to GE.
