 
 Happy Birthday old man.  I am not sure if my voice mail will make it to you(I 
 got some weird instructions), so I thought I would cover my bases.  I have 
 been real busy at work and did not mail your gift until Friday.  It will be a 
 few days late - sorry.  Hope you enjoyed your bachelor time this weekend.  
 Can't beat peace and quiet.  Talk to you soon.
