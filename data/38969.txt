 going in the city by the bay.  Got your address from Sul at Monday nights 
 softball game.  Which we won.  We haven't lost in this section of the fall 
 league and are playing really good ball.  Maybe it is our upgrade at first 
 base.  So I am still not sure if I will be able to come down for the Cal game 
 or not. Right now I am kind of broke from all the flights to LA.  I went and 
 had a few beers with Cheryl last night.  She called me up about 8:00 and I 
 was bored so I decided to go with her.  She got so fucking ass faced.  Man 
 that chick is a train wreck sometimes.  So how is school?  What kind of 
 classes are you taking right now?   You aren't going to convert into being a 
 Giants fan while you are down there are you?  Anyway drop me a line when you 
 get a chance and let me know how everything is going.  Oh by the way:  Beavs
