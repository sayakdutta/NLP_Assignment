 Hey what's the scoop on this?

 What is this project?  Who is the sponsor in the west?
 
  
     
 
 Per our discussion yesterday, these are the people we have identified who will parallel test the consolidated position manager, after an initial limited production release, against results from whatever tools they are using in production today...
 
 EAST		WEST
 
 Smith Day	Kysa Alport
 Corry Bentley	Kate Symes
 
 Only the East guys have participated in early testing in our test environment.  Generally, it is much easier for everyone to test against production data once the app is migrated.  The data in test is pretty ugly.  Since CPM is new and does not update anything, we have no problem moving to prod for further testing once the app is stable.
 
 Glad to discuss...
