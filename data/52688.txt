 Dear Dr. Kaminski
 
 My name is Paolo Cadoni and I work for Risk Magazine in London.  I am
 contacting you to request your assistance. We have recently had a very
 interesting paper submitted for publication, entitled: "Let's Swing Again
 (Pricing Non-Storable Commodity Options)".  I would very much like you to
 act as an anonymous referee for this submission, if it is not too much
 trouble.
 
 
 Keypoints:
 An expectation model with permanent and temporary shocks has been developed
 and used to price a swing option (capacity reservation option) on a
 non-storable commodity. The model is a hybrid of a permanent shock (binomial
 tree) and temporary shock model (reminiscent of Black (1976)). The
 flexibility offered by the model's hybrid nature allows it to capture the
 empirical behaviour of electricity and gas prices: transient spot price
 shocks and calibration  to the futures prices and the futures volatility
 term structure.  As the size of the volatility of the temporary shocks is
 increased the component of the swing option priced derived from the
 temporary shocks quickly dominates the component from the binomial model.
 Therefore, a failure to model the transient shocks when pricing swing
 options may present a serious modelling error.
 
 I do hope that you are able to help us out. If you are in agreement, I can
 email you the paper immediately - we would need the report emailed to us
 within around four weeks. Please get in touch as soon as possible.
 
 
 Many thanks for your time and consideration.
 
 Best regards,
 
 Paolo Cadoni
