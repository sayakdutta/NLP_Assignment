 
 Ehud,
 
 Sorry for the delay in replying to your message.
 I was on the road a lot. I am in London right now and
 plan to attend the conference.
 
 I am leaving on Saturday morning for Houston.
 
 I have asked Shirley to get tickets for one of the evening you mentioned.
 I should know by Thursday if the tickets are available.

 Greetings.
 
 I write at this time for two reasons.  First, w.r.t. 6/28 - 6/29 London, I
 remain uncertain whether you intend personally to attend and present at
 that EPRM Financial Math course.  I wanted to advise you know that, in
 addition to the sightseeing/theatre we traditionally do at these events, we
 -- you, Duane Seppi, Peter Nance and I -- have been invited to dinner at
 the home of Klaus and Renee Toft Sat. evening 6/30.
 
 Second, w.r.t. the subsequent mid-July Houston training course, I write to
 remind you that at EPRM 2001 we discussed the possibility of jointly
 attending a baseball game at Enron Field 7/16 or 7/17.  Per the Astros'
 schedule, it turns out the Cleveland Indians will be in town both nights
 for a 7:05 p.m. first-pitch start time at the Field.  Let me know if either
 7/16 or 7/17 works out from your perspective.
 
 Hope all is well.  Best,
 Ehud
