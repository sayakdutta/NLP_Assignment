 
 Hi guys
 
  In fear of the future I decided today to go ahead and prepare an outline of  
 things we could talk about on Tues.  An unproofed draft of the brief 
 presentation will be sent to you by my assistant.  Please feel free to mark 
 up, delete or supplement.  On Mon when we talk and divy up parts , each 
 person can then finish out the presentation as they want it.  .
 
  Dede I'll call you on Monday at 930 and then we can conference Harlan in.   
 Thanks for everybody's help and have a great weekend.
