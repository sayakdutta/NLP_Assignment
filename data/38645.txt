 Please describe in detail, the downstream capacity available to transport 
 this gas.  How does the CIG capacity being sold to Coastal impact this 
 point?  If you can make the case for this gas flowing without constraint, 
 then I see no problem in making a fixed price bid for the full volume.
 
 A rough sketch of the gas location and its downstream flow options would be 
 nice. 
 
 Thanks,
 
 Mike
