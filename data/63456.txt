 If you are inclined to accept this invitation, we could put together an 
 interesting talk on the importance of good mental health to business with 
 some national statistics and then segue into Enron's emphasis on wellness and 
 having fun in the workplace.  Our strategy and experience will be very 
 interesting to the group since it shows what a corporate leader is doing to 
 become the employer of choice in the marketplace.
 
 You could expect a full house (around 400) for the talk.  If it fits into 
 your schedule, Jack Bowen said he would be delighted to be honorary chairman 
 of the event.
 
 - Rob
