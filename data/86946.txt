 Just let me know when you get the trophy.  I can pick it up at your house 
 (front porch or whatever is convenient for you) and leave the $$ in your 
 mailbox.

 You can send it to me at 1904 Albans 77005. It is small and very mailable.  
 Kali is such a good player and sweet girl - I know she is going to have fun  
 no matter what. I think we all are going to miss the Micro Soccer days with  
 small teams and more of a chance to get to know everyone! Have a great  
 summer! Kathy
