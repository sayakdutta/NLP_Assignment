 Richard:
 
 My view is that TVA will likely use the FERC ruling to attempt to
 retroactively bless their treatment of the Enron control areas last summer.
 Although my understanding is that Entergy used a different method than that
 employed by TVA to restrict the use of a no-load control area, TVA will
 argue that the result is the same and that NERC has, thus, approved
 differing treatment for load and no-load control areas.  The FERC ruling
 will likely create a greater sense of unease on the part of the judge to
 enforce the rules of NERC, a voluntary association, in the face of what
 appears at first blush to be a contrary position taken by FERC, a federal
 agency.

 P.S. T.O. Helton has suggested that he sit in on the upcoming depositions of
 Richard Shen and the 30(b)(6) rep. on TVA's alleged damages to get a better
 feel for the case.  Please let me know your thoughts on this.

 If we appeal and win it will be helpful to our claim against TVA  related to
 the
 control area dispute. . While we have not heard it yet, TVA will argue that
 although TVA did not use the same rational as Entergy to deny parking, Enron
 has
 no damages because of the  FERC ruling. What are our chances of winning?
 
  By copy of this e-mail I will ask our outside counsel, Bob Madden, to
 comment
 on how he thinks the FERC ruling can and will be used against us.

 Do you think we should appeal Entergy source and sink FERC order?  While I
 think
 it is a poorly written order that shows a lack of understanding of the
 issue,
 I'm not sure that we can win on appeal or that it is worth appealing, since
 we
 would not recover our damages against ComEd and TVA for this summer while
 the
 order is in effect.  It would be helpful next summer to be able to park in
 ComEd
 and TVA, since the RTOs will not be running in all likelihood.
 
 Elizabeth/Richard -- Is there a reason in the TVA litigation  that we need
 to
 appeal the decision?
 
 Otherwise, Joe, should we get Dan W. to draft a memo on chances of success
 or
 other reasons for filing an appeal?
