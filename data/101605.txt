 
 that sounds like a very good plan
 
  
     
 oh ok....yeah..i agree...though i want to talk to mike bc i need to know how far he has pushed this through...or how far bobby and mm have.  i just need to explain to mike that i am planning a relocation that involves john and i...a decision together...and that portland is not the only option we are looking at.....just so there is not this expectation that if they offer..i accept.
 
  
     
 oh i just meant..i don't want you to add that as another factor to sway you...that just b/c these guys are all pitching in to help you doesn't mean you have to go there if they offer.
 
  
     
 oh ok....but the whole thing about obligation..what did you mean?  i'm not mad..i'm just curious
 
  
     
 you said you didn't expect it to go to this level this fast...i'm just trying to come up with an explanation of how this happened
 
  
     
 i don't understand what you are trying to say...sry....pls elab
 
  
     
 yeah...but you know how these guys operate....and mike knows how frustrated you've been here...wants to do anything to help
