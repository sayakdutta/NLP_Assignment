 Nancy,
  We have received two charts attached to the November 9, 2000
 prepared statement of Diane Jacob, a San Diego Supervisor, which shows
 retail prices per KWH for 1999 and 2000.  In the transcript she refers to
 another chart -- one that supposedly shows "outrageously excessive profits
 by traders."  It would appear that we have the wrong chart.  The missing
 chart is also the one referred to in Chairman Hoecker's questions to Enron.
 Could you try again to locate this profit chart and get it to us as soon as
 possible.  We need it to evaluate the proposed responses.
 
 Thanks
 Gary
