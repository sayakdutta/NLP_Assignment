 
 Great job on discussing status and next steps with the group this afternoon 
 on OPM.  The presentation and your comments were direct and concise.  And 
 your delivery of the information was very well done -- you were poised, 
 organized, prepared and confident.  It was an effective and informative 
 presentation to the group.  
 
 Thanks for your dedication and enthusiasm on this project.
