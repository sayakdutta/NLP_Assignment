 Here is a rough draft.  I will also start on TVA letter.  Per my earlier vm, 
 I am struggling with the benefit of a 2 year proposal vs. 7.  I'm not sure if 
 we get any "cap" benefit from making a seven year deal even if TVA doesn't 
 accept our offers (benefit would assume that TVA has an obligation to cover 
 entire position which is contrary to what our outside counsel has said in the 
 past.  According to Bob, since TVA is asking for specific performance, it may 
 not be reasonable for TVA to cover entire period.  I will try to talk to him 
 tonight.). If  TVA accepts one of our proposals and then we lose the 
 termination argument, what do we do? Supply? Terminate Again? In either case 
 our proposal for 7 years will likely not cap our damages.  Let me know what 
 you think.  I'll be in early tomorrow.  Thanks
