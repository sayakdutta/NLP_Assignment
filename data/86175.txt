 I think the amendment only brought the collateral threshold to zero for trades after Dec. 31, 2001.  There was no mention in the amendment of the new ENMAX entity.  We sent a draft ISDA for ENMAX Energy Marketing, Inc. but have not heard anything from them.

 Stephanie,
 
 I think this might be your matter.  Could you advise Wendy as to your findings.
 
 Thanks.

 Susan,
 
 Could you please follow up with the above referenced counterparty to see where they are on our amendment to the existing ISDA?  This amendment provides for ENMAX Energy Marketing Inc. as a new contracting party under the agreement.  
 
 Thanks for you help!
 
 Wendy
