 The fees that we charge for marketing EES has been revised and will take effect 10/4/01.  The new fees are as follows:
 
 	1-100mw's=$3 fee
 	100-200mw's=$4 fee
 	over 200mw=$5 fee
 
 Please note that if we market 101mw's for EES then we charge them $4 on the whole 101mw's for a total fee of $404.  Also if we were to market 201mw's for them then the total fee would be $1005 dollars.  In other words if they go over a the limit on one fee then we charge them the higher fee on all the mw's.
 
 thanks,
