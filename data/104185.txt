 Willie received a call from Mike Billings, the trader at Dow,
 and he requested that deal #EY0963.1 from 6/15/99 be revised
 from Dow Hydrocarbons to Dow Chemical.
 
 He is currently signing and sending back the other trades that were
 changed.  
 
 Is it okay to change this deal also, and on a "going forward" basis, all
 trades must be through Dow Hydrocarbons...
 
 let me know...thanks...mgg
