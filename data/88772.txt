 
 I am preparing a re-draft of a previous agreement for this Canadian company.  
 Credit terms default for Duke Guarantor is 25M/ 50M for Enron.  Triggering 
 event for both parties is 10M w/ 250 multiples.  Do you want to change 
 these?  It is my understanding we have guaranties in place.    Please advise 
 asap.
 
 Thanks!
