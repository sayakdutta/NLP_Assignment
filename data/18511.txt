 
 I'm trying to meet a deadline at the moment, but are you free this 
 afternoon?  I have some information that can help a lot in that analysis.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Thanks Jeff.  On a related note, we are trying to put together a financial 
 "headroom" forecast for DWR/State of California that goes out a few years and 
 shows:  
 
 Rate Revenues
 less:  Utility gen costs
  QF costs
  DWR PPA's
  DWR spot purchases
 Margin
 Total Deficit
 
 Bond Issue
 Bond Principal & Interest
 
 Would you know how to get something like that? 
 
 Regards,

 FYI:  Just got off the phone with Michael Hoffman, who's one of two key 
 outside financial advisors to Davis on the electricity crisis. The 
 administration is trying to get a legally binding agreement between the PUC 
 and DWR to ensure that the PUC doesn't muck around with the money (via 
 utility rates) DWR requires to be creditworthy.  They were shooting for this 
 Friday to have a draft of the document read for folks to review, but it now 
 looks like it won't get resolved until (at the earliest) next week----seems 
 that the one PUC lawyer who can actually do the work is on vacation.  Go 
 figure.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
