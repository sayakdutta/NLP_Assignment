 Pursuant to Frank Sayre's request, I am attaching a clean and blacklined copy of the draft Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement, together with the draft Paragraph 13 to the Credit Support Annex, which drafts incorporate the latest comments and revisions.
 
 Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions or comments.
 
 Thank you!
