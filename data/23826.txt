I had included in my drafts to Kevin the Mktg Strategy slides (2) from our 2002 stuff, but we probably need to expand that to address expansions etc, but I was waiting until we finalized what we were going to project in the 10 year plan.  The strategy should be the same for the Rating Agency slide bullets as for the Business Plan Text.
 
 
 
     
 
 Lindy, what is the marketing strategy section Kevin is talking about.

 Hopefully I got it right this time.  We still  need to get the Selected Financial Data and the marketing strategy put  together.  Thank you all for helping on this.  Rod, I will leave it to  you as to whether or not you want to send to Stan as a first draft.
