 would like to schedule time with you and Mark T to think through how we 
 should approach the creation/adoption of a single contract for 
 physical/financial(maybe) trading.  
 Thanks

 Elizabeth:
 
 ISDA is holding an Energy conference on March 6th, 2001 at The Four Seasons
 Hotel in Houston.  We would be delighted to have you speak again on the same
 issues you discussed at our North American Energy and Developing Products
 Committee meeting last October at The Regency Hyatt.
 
 Please find attached a DRAFT agenda for the morning discussion for your
 information.  I am in the process of finalizing the agenda and would
 appreciate advice on selecting bullet points to describe briefly the
 discussion on the Comparison of Master Agreements used in North America and
 Europe.  I have allowed 45 minutes for the discussion (12:15 PM - 1:00 PM).
 In addition, we would welcome any suggestions you may have on inviting an
 ISDA member from a another company to help you discuss topic.
