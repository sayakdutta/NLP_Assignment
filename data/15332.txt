 
 Cheryl, I was in your store on 9/23/00 and saw some Bernhardt furniture I am 
 interested in.  It is the Paris Collection Dining Table and Chairs and the 
 numbers are:
 
 346-242  Table
 346-244  Base
 346-502  Air Chair (4)
 346-501  Side Chair
 
 Also I am interested in one of the two beds in the Paris Collection:
 
 346-435  Sleigh Bed 5-0
 
 346-527  Metal Canopy 5-0
 346-457  Poster Bed 5-0
 346-416  Poster Headboard 4-6 thru 5-0
 
 On the second bed I am not sure if you need all three pieces or not so it 
 would help if you could tell me what is the difference between the three 
 pieces.  Finally, I am interested in an amroire and chest of draws (there are 
 several depending if I go with a granite top or not):
 346-144  Armoire
 346-237  Right Stone Top
 346-236  Right Bachelor's Chest Base
 346-235  Right Bachelor'e Chest
 346-042  Dressing Chest
 346-044  Dressing Chest Stone Top
 346-043  Dressing Chest Base
 
 I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow.  If it is easier you can email 
 me with the prices and then call to go over the info (instead of having to 
 give 15 prices).  My work number is 713-853-5933.
 
 Thanks,
