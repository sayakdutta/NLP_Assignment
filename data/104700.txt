 
 Yes, because Treasa told me this morning that this could "make or break the 
 deal"!
 
 Of course, you are absolutely welcome to join me (and Marcus if he is 
 available).

 Sara, I would like to sit in on this if I can -- I have a 10 a.m. conference 
 call myself and I don't know how long it will last.
 
 Does the fact that  you put the phrase "no big deal" in quotations indicate a 
 certain amount of skepticism on your part?

 Marcus:  
 
 TD has scheduled a conference call with me at 10:30 am Houston time to 
 discuss the crude swap (related to the prepay).  Mataly Sahoni (?) said that 
 they wanted to discuss some "credit issues" and that it was "no big deal."
 
 You are welcome to join me.  Sara
 
 P.S.  Bob Bruce (Ext. 57780; EB 3880D) will back me up while I am out of the 
 office tomorrow afternoon, Monday and Tuesday. I'll be back on Wednesday, 
 Nov. 22.
