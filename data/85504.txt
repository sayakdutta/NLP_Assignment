 We have scheduled a Project HIWAY demo for Tuesday, November 14, starting 
 with lunch at 11:30.  The demo will be held in room 49C3.  At this time we 
 will bring everyone up to date regarding the web site project of allowing 
 shippers and operators of HPL the ability to access their respective contract 
 and meter  information in a secured internet environment.  We will also 
 discuss plans to allow shipper nominations and operator confirmations over 
 the net.  
 
 If you have any questions, please call.
