 Yes, 1:30 is good.  I'm on the 6th floor in the new building back by the windows in the trading area.  There are plenty of conference rooms around here.  I'll see you then.  Thanks,
 Fletch
 
  
     
 Does 1:30 work for you? What location?

 Danielle,
 
 I'd like to meet with you sometime today (I have a meeting from 10:00 - 11:30) to discuss what we're services we're talking to PIRA about for both gas and power.  Please let me know what time you can meet.  Thanks,
 
 Fletch
