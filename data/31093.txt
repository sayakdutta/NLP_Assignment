 her on any appalachian/local production issues.  She will be the one setting 
 this up in Sitara in the future.
 
 Thanks.

 I called Jill Linkenauger Friday afternoon... haven't heard back. My plan is 
 to talk to her and then Kevin McCracken at CNR to have this agency switch 
 over by April 1st. I thought it was done... but not 100% sure.

 Hey cats. Sylvia needs to know if we are agent for CES regarding CNR 
 contracts. I began setting up the contracts on Friday, but she stopped me in 
 the middle cuz she wants to make sure that we are setting them up correctly. 
 I have 50 to 70 to set up. Please let me know what you know. - Thanks, Rob
