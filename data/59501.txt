 Kam, 
 
 Ramesh said it was fine to add these three trading locations to the list.
 
 The enrties will have to be inserted into the range in the "Field Constraints" spreadsheet tab.
 I think the dropdowns will automatically update.
 
 If not, please let me know, I can modify the sheet and send out a new version.  Thanks!
