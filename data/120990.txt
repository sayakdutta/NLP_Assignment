 
 Steve,
 
 I need your help with something.  I want to look at Pasadena's load profile and am having trouble obtaining this.  Is it possible for you to send me your actual daily burns for up to the past two years?  This would be helpful in assisting you with your risk management needs and with structuring products specifically for Pasadena.
 
 Let me know if you can help.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kim
