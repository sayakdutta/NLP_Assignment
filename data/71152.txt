 The escrow agreements and fee schedule appear fine to me.  If you have any
 comments, please advise.  Thanks.

 Attached are what I hope are the final and execution copies of the three
 escrow agreements as well as the schedule of fees. Changes are highlighted
 in red.  Please forward your comments to me.
 
 Thanks,
