 Shelley,
 I also found out that Luth. did fly out of Houston. They were sold out on the 
 10th and only had 3 seats on the 11th.  I will do more looking when we know 
 for sure the dates. If the prices are really high, then Fred may stay home, 
 and I will go. Is it looking like just you, are is Kim going also?
