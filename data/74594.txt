 
 Yes, this stuff is for the purchaser's bank.
 
 
 
 

   
  
 Kay:  Is there anything different from the forms you and I worked on
 earlier.

 Hi Danetta,
 
 I heard a rumor that you are the one to look at this stuff.  I know that
 you recently went through the process in connection with the Fountain
 Valley transaction.  I'm happy to serve up those forms to Freshfields if
 that makes it is easier for you.
 
 My number is 713 345 7566.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay

 Hi Kent,
 
 I don't know whether Lee has mentioned the Delta Power deal that we are
 working on.  We are taking 4 turbines and putting them in an LLC, and
 selling some of the interest in the LLC to Delta Power.  Three of the
 turbines are turbines formerally known as LV Co Gen turbines, and we are
 buying new LM's to replace the ones we are using here.  In any event, Delta
 Power is financing the deal, and they have asked that we get GE sign off on
 the attached documents.  Therefore, I would be interested in your response
 to the attached.
 
 I understand that Lee is in New Orleans today, but I'll send him a copy
 anyway.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
