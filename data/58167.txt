 To keep pace with the fluid and fast-changing demands of our equity trading 
 activities, Enron Wholesale Services ("EWS") has recently revised its 
 official Policies and Procedures Regarding Confidential Information and 
 Securities Trading ("Policies and Procedures"). These revisions reflect two 
 major developments: (1) our equity trading activities have been extended into 
 the United Kingdom, and (2) in an effort to streamline the information flow 
 process, the "Review Team" will play a more centralized role, so that the 
 role of the "Resource Group" is no longer necessary.You are required to 
 become familiar with, and to comply with, the Policies and Procedures. The 
 newly revised Policies and Procedures are available for your review on 
 LegalOnline, the new intranet website maintained by the Enron Wholesale 
 Services Legal Department. Please click on the attached link to access 
 LegalOnline:

 If you have already certified compliance with the Policies and Procedures 
 during the 2001 calendar year, you need not re-certify at this time, although 
 you are still required to to review and become familiar with the revised 
 Policies and Procedures. If you have not certified compliance with the 
 Policies and Procedures during the 2001 calendar year, then you must do so 
 within two weeks of your receipt of this message. The LegalOnline site will 
 allow you to quickly and conveniently certify your compliance on-line with 
 your SAP Personal ID number. If you have any questions concerning the 
 Policies or Procedures, please call Bob Bruce at extension 5-7780 or Donna 
 Lowry at extension 3-1939.
