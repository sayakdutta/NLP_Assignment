 
 Charlene,
 
 I coordinate my schedule with Ashley Baxter from your organization, who is 
 responsible
 for recruiting at Berkeley. I have talked to her about this presentation a 
 few times. As you can see,
 she is on the distribution list.
 
 The presentation is scheduled for the 23rd of October. We have tried to 
 combine the presentation with
 another recruiting trip, but we have to many conflicting schedules.

 Vince when is your presentation scheduled?  I can get someone from my group 
 but since the recruiters are all on the road I would need a date so that they 
 or I could coordinate with you.  Thanks

 Steve,
 
 I am a lead recruiter at the University of California at Berkeley for
 Enron Analyst/Associate program.
 
 I contacted several friends who work at Berkeley and received an invitation
 from one of them to make a presentation at the weekly Faculty Seminar
 of the Dept. of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research.
 
 The students and faculty members from the business school will be also 
 invited.
 
 Berkeley in general, and Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations 
 Research in
 particular, are important centers of academic research on electricity markets
 (S. Oren works very closely with Severin Borenstein).
 
 My presentation will focus on the Analyst/Associate program. I shall  also 
 have
 an opportunity to discuss the power markets in California (I expect many
 questions) before many experts who are very  important to shaping
 public opinion and regulatory agenda.
 
 Please, let me know who in you group could help me in preparing this 
 presentation
 and in presenting  Enron's point of view in a more effective way.
 
 
 Vince
