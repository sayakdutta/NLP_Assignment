 
 Sounds good.  I would like Monte to prepare my estimate on newcurrentday first, submit it to you, then calc the book.  Is this okay?

 Mike,
 
 I would like to start asking your group for an estimate for their P&L's daily.  If our numbers come out over or under their tolerance we will call them before we sign off for the night so there are no surprises in the morning.  If you don't have a problem with this I would like to start this today.
 
 Thanks
