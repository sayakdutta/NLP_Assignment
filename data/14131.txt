 Cathy,
 
 The voluntary separation calculator asks for a number for 2 weeks pay.  Should that be four weeks, or does the program take the 2 weeks and multiply it to arrive at the four weeks base pay number?  If the latter, I can see it creating some confusion.  If the calculation sheet needs to be set up that way, perhaps we should drop a note explaining.
