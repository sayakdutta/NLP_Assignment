 
 Having now checked my calendar, I find that the legal PRC meeting is scheduled for June 5.  It is unlikely that I will be able to attend the lunch.
 
  
     
 
 Hi Jim,
 
 As I mentioned in the elevator last week, we are trying to become more involved with Girls, Inc.  We would love for you and Carrin to sit at the Enron table at their Fifth Annual Luncheon on Tuesday, June 5th.  This event will take place at the George R. Brown Convention Center at 12 p.m.  Please let me know if you're in town.  If you unfortunately can't attend, please let Carrin know that we would be honored for her to join us!  
 
 Regarding SPA, I spoke with Toby Maddox a few weeks ago and he is completely on board with Enron's sponsorship of a performance by David Sedaris, a well-known satirist/author.  We supported this past spring's performance of the National Symphony of Spain at the $10,000 level, so we plan to maintain that level of support for the 2002 David Sedaris performance.  Toby and I discussed having a pre-performance cocktail reception for Enron employees and guests to meet Mr. Sedaris.  Please mark your calendar for April 17, 2002!
 
 As always, I greatly appreciate your input.  I look forward to hearing from you.  
 Thank you,  
 Misha
