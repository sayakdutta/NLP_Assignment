 
 Well, I can't meet at 10:00.  Steve just asked me to attend a "Stan restructuring" meeting for him at 10:00 (Steve's on vacation).  I'd say let's reschedule for this afternoon, but I want to wait to see if there's anything we have to do ASAP from this meeting this afternoon.  Let me get back with you.
 
  
     
 10 works for me.  Where on 39 are you?
 
 Cheers.
 
  
     
 I got your message.  They just got my phone and computer hooked-up (I'm on 39 now).  Can you get together tomorrow?  How about 10:00?  Let me know.
 
 Thanks, 
 Lindy
