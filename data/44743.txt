 Tana,
 
 I have had a request from Michael Khajeh-Noori, Deepak Sitlani (London) and 
 Michael Schuh  (Frankfurt) to access to the NEW Master Swap Agreements 
 database, can you please confirm if they are allowed to access this database, 
 and if so what level of access they should have.
 
 Thanks & Regards
