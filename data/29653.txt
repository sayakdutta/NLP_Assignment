 
 In light of numerous construction delays, increased sponsor contributions, 
 unusual central bank exposures etc. we would like to conduct a comprehensive 
 review of our insurance coverages  for the Cuiaba I Project.  I am availble 
 at your convenience to begin meeting for the exchange of info which will be 
 required to fulfill this endeavor. I will be the point person on behalf of 
 the project.  My Assistant, Blanca Bollom can make all of the meeting 
 arrangements. Please let us know who should attend.
