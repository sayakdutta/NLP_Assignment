 
 Liz,
 
 What about suggesting Friday, September 7 for the Santa Fe, Prediction Co, trip?
 Greg would like to combine the trip with a weekend in Santa Fe.
 
 We could go to Stanford on Thursday, the day before. 
 
 Also, they want to speak about the agenda and the NDA. Can you ask Greg if
 he wants to participate in the conference call? I want to propose Friday, 2:00 p.m. our time, for
 a conference call. Given that they want to discuss the NDA, we could include the lawyer,
 Mark Taylor, as well.
 
 Vince
 
  
     
 Vince,
 
 When would be a good time for us to call you?  We would like to talk
 about the agenda for your visit and the NDA you sent us.
