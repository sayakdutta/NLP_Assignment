 do need to talk.  My schedule is a mess but as i stated in last email, go 
 ahead and call Jeff and discuss.  LNG is ours and thanks for the input.  We 
 will be making big changes and growing without incumbency.  Mike Brown does 
 work for us but I dont really know what he does and would like your input.

 Mike,
 
 Any chance we could set  a time for Jonathan and me to speak with you and 
 Shankman on crude & liquids possibilities in Asia?  Also has Mike Brown and 
 his group now moved under Global markets?  And lastly, any further thoughts 
 on LNG?  These LNG guys showed up this week without much direction and it 
 turns out the person they were going to meet with is not even here.  In 
 effect, they have come to Japan to make a conference call.
