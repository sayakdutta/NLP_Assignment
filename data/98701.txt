 next week?
 
 
 
 

    
 
 CFP and I discussed my question, posed
 to both you and her, about whether I
 needed to involve others at my firm in this
 case.  Her view was no, and I do not
 disagree.  But I did not hear from you
 and, still scarred from my prior error in
 assuming that CFP spoke for Enron, I
 would like to have your view.  So, again: do you want Geoff Harrison, Vineet 
 Bhatia
 or Steve Susman involved in this case? Right now it is being handled by a
 Bracewell team, a V&E team, and me as
 the sole SG contributor.  That's fine with
 me if it is with you and JVD.
