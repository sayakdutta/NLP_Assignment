 
 Here's the TurboPark consent.  Please call me if you  have any comments, as I 
 want to send it out tonight.
 
 Sheila, I've spoken with Lee Johnson and John Schroeder, and they are lined 
 up to sign at 900 tomorrow.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
 
 
 
 PS this is consent to send 12 to TurboPark. This gives us room if the Coral 
 deal doesn't happen in time.
