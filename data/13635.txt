 
 I've sent this to litigation unit.  MHC
 
  
     
 
 I meant to include you on this email.  EDD
  
     
 This is resume for a good guy and a friend of mine from my judicial clerkship days who is looking to move back to Houston (he was with VE here for several years) and is hoping to find a litigation position in house.  Sanders says EWS isn't looking.  Any ideas re Corp. or our other subs.?  
 
  
     
 Eddy:
 
 Attached is Field's resume.  Obviously, give him or me a call as you see
 fit.
 
 Again, thanks for your help.
 
 Jeff
