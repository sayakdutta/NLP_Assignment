 Don Baughman contacted me late last week to request information on who of his employees have current employment agreements.  He states that he has responsiblity for Midwest Realtime, SE Realtime and the schedulers in those regions.   Seems like a logical request given the direct reports are correct. Are you comfortable with me providing this information?
