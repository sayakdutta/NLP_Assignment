Since there will be an allocation to my cost center, please limit access to this to myself - Bruce Mills does not need access.  Please call if you have any questions.

 Jackson Logan mentioned that you need access to information from Canadian Enerdata.  We are currently in the process of renegotiating/renewing our agreement and I am trying to identify users who need continued access to this data.  Are you currently
 receiving the data?  If so, would you like to continue receiving it in the future?  Please read my initial message below.
 
 Thanks,

 I am not certain as to weather they are on the list or not.  The best thing to do would be to call them.
 
 Thanks,

 Thanks.  Do you know if they are currently receiving it?  They were not on the list that the vendor provided.

 I do not need to receive this publication anymore, however, I am aware that Phillip Love and Bruce Mills need to receive this.
 
 Thank you,

 You are listed as receiving information either by email or fax from Canadian Enerdata.  Our agreement with Canadian Enerdata is up for renewal and we need to identify whether or not you need continued access to this information.  Upon renewal, if you are a continued user, a portion of the cost will be allocated to your cost center.
 
 Please respond to this message and let me know if you need continued access.
 
 I appreciate your help.
