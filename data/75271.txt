 
 I ate at the Met, so I had a big lunch.  Fridge foraging is fine.
 
 I would get the stone delivered as early as possible, so that I can pace 
 myself.  Bob said he ordered 1700 pounds, if I am remembering correctly.  
 Guess I should go look.

 Wow, I just got this message...
 I think we should put the camera out of reach before there's no more film...
 I think we should call and have some stone delivered on the 19th. or even
 this Saturday. How much do you think we need?
 I'm glad your not sore and I think you are doing a great job with the yard.
 Eat out of the frig tonight? I'm thinking a sausage wrap and tater
 tots...Love, NM
 
 
     
 
 Good morning,
 
 Just checking in.  Michael and I had a good morning.  No weird outfits
 today.  Figures, since I now have a camera ready to go.
 
 So what do you think about the stone thing? I like the way Bob's front yard
 looks.
 
 I'm not sore today, but then again, I didn't do all that much.  Our yard is
 looking better, though.
 
 Hope you are having a good day.
 
 Love,
