 We are in the process of reviewing and upgrading our pulp, paper, lumber and 
 steel trading contract documentation platforms.
 
 Attached for your review and comments are the draft Master and Sample GTCs 
 and Confirms for these commodities.
 
 Please forward any comments with specific language changes to me by March 
 1st.  You are invited to a meeting March 2 at 11: 00 a.m. in EB38C1 to
