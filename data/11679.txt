 
 I have fixed our slide. Rick
 
  
     
 
 Attached is the draft presentation of the internal controls component of the audit.  We are only planning on including the first 4 of 8 pages.   The last 4 pages were built anticipating Andersen being involved and are included here for reference only.
 
 Page 4 is the RAC component. 
 
 Thanks,
 
 Andrew
