 Welcome back - I'm running to a meeting and then out this week for work and play, but will try to get hold of you next week. work wise, nothing jumps to mind (Azurix as I'm sure you are aware is the best move you never made),, but I will keep my ears open and my thinking cap on.

 Hi, Liz  -
 
    I am back in Houston after  a  couple of months  in  Europe and Virginia
 and  am  starting to look around  for  work post MDCK. If you hear of
 anything, I would appreciate  your keeping me in mind. I would most like to
 find some sort of  special project  work where I can fill a need  part time
 and  get to know some  folks  rather than jumping in head first into a
 permanent  spot.If there is anyone  else I should contact who might have
 some ideas  I would appreciate hearing  about them as well.If  you have a
 chance  , could you send me  Kerry galvin's email address? Iam at  512  653
 3063. Thanks. RP
