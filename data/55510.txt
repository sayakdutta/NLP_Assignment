 Dr. Kaminski,
 
 On Wednesday, June 14th I attended your presentation entitled "THE CHALLENGE
 OF VALUATION OF ENERGY RELATED DERIVATIVES" at the Risk 2000 conference in
 Boston.  Can you please e-mail me the slides you presented.
 
 Also, you mentioned that the method you used to calculate volatility for
 energy prices was not the "normal" method.  Can you please tell me, or give
 me a reference to the method that you did use.
 
 Thank you,
