 Debra and Tammi, I have sent the master agreement to legal and credit for
 review.  Have asked for a response by Tuesday.  I have asked Steve Painter
 (919-546-3993)to follow to make certain this keeps moving.  Please also
 provide a confirmation that shows CP&L instead of FPC as the contracting
 party.  Thank you.
