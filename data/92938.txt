 
 It wasn't just me changing plans.  All I ask is that sometime over the 
 weekend we see Finding Forrester.  And of course get my car aligned Sat. and 
 a tuneup Monday.  Now that I'm thinking about it I'm going to be spending a 
 lot of money this weekend on things that aren't exactly fun.  Oh well.  
 
 I'm planning to get out of here around 4:30ish if nothing goes wrong.  So 
 just call me at home when you get home.  Oh, yeah....Chipper means happy, or 
 in a good mood, kind of in a bouncy mood.
 
 Talk to ya later,
 Robin
