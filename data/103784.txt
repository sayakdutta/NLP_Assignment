 re-executed.  I have the prior agreement in my office (if you want it). 
 Please let me see the cover letter you submit to Lisa.  Please add this to 
 the equity list.
 (2)  I will give you Direct Trading for execution.  It should also be added 
 to the equity list.
 (3)  I think we need to add a reference to the First Boston Enron Corp. 
 account to the equity list.
