 
 The MLP discussions have been on using Northern Border.  
 
 Regarding KMI, Mark and I met with them before Xmas to see where they were on the rate.  They have not presented anything to their management team for approval beyond our original proposal.  
 
 I believe that Stan is looking for the status of the game plan.  We are looking to lay out the game plan on how we would finance the project(if we project finance I think Stan and Danny are looking at securing enough money at the same time to do the Sun Devil, Trans Pecos and PG&E 20 mile line all together), define what the project return requirement is, determine the comfort factor of the project costs, staying in concert with KMI and making the final proposal to Pemex.  
 
 I will make myself available at your convenience on Monday morning to discuss.
 
 Have a great weekend.  Kim. 
 
 
     
 
 I will call you monday morning to discuss. What is the status of the pemex discussions? When dan mentions mlp, is he referring to using border or setting up a new one? Is stan looking for a go / no go decision?

 Yes, the 1:30 is the prep meeting to the 3:30 Stan meeting.  Danny wants us to look at project financing vs. MLP.  If you get a chance, call me Monday when you get back in the office and we can discuss a little further.  Happy New Year.
 
 Kim.
 
 
     
 
 Is this in addition to the one with Dan at 1:30?
