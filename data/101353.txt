 Sounds perfect....  I'm also being a wimp about driving home tonight because
 I've been feeling like I am about to get sick for three days. Someone told

 Leslie is moving to Houston tomorrow.  She is living at the Extended Stay
 America near you.  (So is Joe.)  I will tell her to give you a call-- she
 will be working at the DA's office.  Lots of single guys with social
 consciences who know that money isn't everything....
