 I received a report from HR and it appears there is conflicting information 
 regarding some of the titles for various employees.  Please verify that the 
 titles are correct for everyone in your group.  The ones that I made changes 
 to are in red.
 
 Thanks, Paula.
 
 
  
    Roberts, Chaun; Leigh, Lorie; Guerra, Claudia; Shoemake, Lisa
 Cc: Guerra, Ricardo
  
 
 
 I formatted the file so that it would print on one legal size sheet.  Please 
 use this new file as opposed to the one I sent earlier.

 Please review the attached org chart for March and submit any changes by noon 
 tomorrow.  It is imperative that all of the information on the attached file 
 is accurate, including titles, as this information is being given directly to 
 John Lavorato and Louise Kitchen.
 
 Thanks, Paula.
