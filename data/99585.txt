 Most men will never quite figure out why the sexual urges of men & women di=
 ffer so much. And I never have figured out the whole Mars & Venus thing. An=
 d, I never have figured out why men think with their head and women with th=
 eir heart.  And, I never yet have figured out how the sexual desire gene ge=
 ts thrown into a state of turmoil, when it hears the words "I do". One even=
 ing last week, my wife and I were getting into bed. Well, the passion start=
 s to heat up, and she eventually says, "I don't feel like it, I just want y=
 ou to hold me." I said, "WHAT??" So she says the words that I and every hus=
 band on the planet dreads. She explains that I must not be in tune with her=
  emotional needs as a Woman. I'm thinking, "What was her first clue?" I fin=
 ally realize that nothing is going to happen that night, so I went to bed. =
 The very next day the we went shopping at a big unnamed department store...=
  I walked around while she tried on three very expensive outfits. She could=
 n't decide which one to take, so I told her to take all three of them. She =
 then tells me that she wants matching shoes worth $200 each to which I say =
 OK. And then we go to the Jewelry Dept. where she gets a set of diamond ear=
 rings. Let me tell you ...she was so excited. She must have thought that I =
 was one wave short of a shipwreck, but I don't think she cared. I think she=
  was testing me when she asked for a tennis bracelet because she doesn't ev=
 en play tennis. I think I threw her for a loop when I told her that it was =
 OK. She was almost sexually excited from all of this and you should have se=
 en her face when she said, "I'm ready to go, let's go to the cash register.=
 " I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out, "No, honey. I don't fee=
 l like buying all this stuff now." You should have seen her face ... it wen=
 t completely blank.  I then said, "Really honey! I just want you to HOLD th=
 is stuff for a while." And just when she had this look like she was going t=
 o kill me, I added, "You must not be in tune with my financial needs as a M=
 an." I figure that I should be having sex again sometime during the spring =
 thaw.
