 
 Linda called and said that they do not have enough vacation days left in 2001, so they would like to use one of the later packages in 2002.
 They asked how late in 2002 they could possibly go and I said I would have to ask you what's available.
 Give me a call when you get a chance.
 This is what I could not remember the other day when we talked.
 
 	See Ya,
