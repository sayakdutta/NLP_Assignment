 
 It was a pleasure having you as a houseguest!  Anytime...
 
 The current issue of Texas Monthly is only the beginning...right after we announced our current earnings last week, The Wall Street Journal originated a story about a partnership our CFO invested in that made questionable statements about conflicts of interests with the shareholders, non-disclosure of profits, etc., and have kept up with this story since last week, we have had shareholder lawsuits, SEC inquiries, our stock has taken a dive down to $15 today, down from $33 when the story first ran, and $87 since the beginning of the year.  Right now it is beat up Enron time with no end in sight.  Anyway, you may to check the WSJ website and catch up...
 
 Also,  I have a new boyfriend, my old biking buddy I mentioned we've been dating now for a few months, that seems to be going well.  So that's all my news...

 Tana,
 
 I was thinking of you today because I just got my issue of Texas Monthly and
 both of your Houston employers were subjects of stories.  You might be
 interested.
 
 How have you been?  I really appreciate your putting me up for the weekend.
 I would very gladly return the favor if I can.  Which reminds me.  Do you
 want to come here this summer to see the Vatican exhibit?  The tickets are
 free, you just need to reserve them.  There is an 800 number for info.  When
 I find it again I can send it to you.  There is also a website,under the
 auspices of Texas Tech museum.
 
 That's all for now.  Take care.
 
 Kathy
