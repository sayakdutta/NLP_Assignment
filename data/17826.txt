 *PG&E <PCG.N> SAYS PACIFIC G&E FILED FOR CHAPTER 11 VOLUNTARY
 BANKRUPTCY RELIEF
 
 
 NEW YORK, April 6 (Reuters) - Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which is 
 California's largest investor-owned utility and has been struggling with that 
 state's power crisis, said on Friday it filed a voluntary petition for 
 bankruptcy protection with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern 
 District of California. 
 
 Trading was halted in PG&E shares on the New York Stock Exchange before the 
 filing. They last traded at $11.36, down 2 cents. 
 
 The Chapter 11 filing was disclosed in mirror filings by the utility and its 
 parent, San Francisco-based PG&E Corp. <PCG.N>, with the Securities and 
 Exchange Commission. 
 
 The utility said in the filing that it "retains control of its assets and is 
 authorized to operate its business as a debtor in possession while being 
 subject to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court." 
 
 A 1996 state utility law deregulated wholesale prices but capped retail 
 prices. Pacific G&E has said it accumulated more than $8.9 billion of back 
 debts because a rate freeze prevents it from passing on its soaring wholesale 
 power costs to consumers.
