 
 Good morning.  I am at EOTT today and then I will go into to town for a 
 little while.  Jessica is no9t doing very well and neither I am I.  Fell like 
 I am coming down with something.  Talk with you later tonight.  Sorry I 
 didn,t get to talk with you last night.  Both babies were real fussy and we 
 had to work hard to get them down.  I did a pretty good job with Jason!
 
 I look forward to you getting home for Turkey Day!
