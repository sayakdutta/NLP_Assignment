 Even trades that won't start flowing or are still flowing this year?  I think 
 we can pull an EOL report on transacted volumes but I can't pull a report 
 that size until after trading today.

 Thanks.
 
 I am looking for volumes that traded last year - not necessarily volumes that 
 flowed.  Volumes that flowed include term transactions.
 Can you think of a way to find this info?

 Hope this is what you were looking for.

 Here are the total volumes by quarter and by region.  We are looking into the 
 EOL since we do not have currently have regional information.  Perhaps you 
 have a way of estimating based on CPR?
