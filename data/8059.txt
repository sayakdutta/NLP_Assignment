 
 As a result of the reorg announcement a couple of weeks ago, this report 
 should now go to Philippe Bibi (or his assistant, Peggy McCurley).  Louise is 
 now in the office of the chair of Enron Americas.  Philippe has assumed the  
 role as chairman of Enron Net Works.  Since this report is a Net Works 
 report, please remove Louise from the distribution list and add Philippe and 
 Peggy effective immediately.  
 
 Also, I would like to review and perhaps edit the principal projects/deals 
 section each week before distribution.  What would be the most efficient way 
 to get this done and into your hands in a timely way?  --Sally
