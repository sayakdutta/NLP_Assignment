 
 Thanks very much Dave.  We've got the proposal (and we've got a few issues 
 with it).  
 
 Rog:
 I know that you're swamped managing EES' book, etc.  So I'd be happy to fill 
 Dave in on EES' view of CLECA's proposal, the negotiations that are underway 
 generally, and what we're cooking up to try to help the negotitations along.  
 Just let me know.    
 
 Also, Dave, be happy to talk to Hanson, and fill them in one what's going on 
 out there if that would be useful.
 
 Jeff

 I got this from Hanson.  Please advise as to which points we agree with and 
 which we disagree with.  I want to know because I talk to this guy quite a 
 bit and EES and ENA are trying to do a deal with him.  I probably will have 
 several opportunities to influence him, if necessary.  Barbara Barkovich and 
 Bill Booth probably had a big hand in developing this doc.
 
 
 
 Any follow up necessary?
