 
 Dan says,  Cutter in acting as "Representative" for Harley,  would receive 
 payments from Enron.   With regards to deals,  deals with Harley at different 
 prices is ok.  
 
 Concerning FM,  Harley could claim FM for delivery to the meter. 
 
 Hope this helps.  If  not, please discuss further with 
 Dan.
