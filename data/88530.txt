 
 I wish I could,  I signed up for a lunch meeting on finance (which I need) 
 also, my desk is loaded.  Can we do lunch/ or shop Friday or next week?   How 
 are you feeling?  Puppy is great, I am very lucky he is a great dog.   An 
 speaking of the 4h's,  you know who called and is breaking ground on the  
 house and barn!
