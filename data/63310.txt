 
 Oh, Gabriella (that is such a pretty name!) -
 
 I apologize for not responding.  The conference details have been a bit 
 confusing to us as we didn't seem to have many.  Mr. Lay is scheduled to 
 participate in a Ministerial Working Dinner the evening of May 15.  He has to 
 give a brief report on his forum session from earlier in the afternoon.  It 
 is being held at the Kleber International Conference Centre.  Therefore, Dr. 
 and Mrs. Lay will not be able to attend.
 
 Thank you.
