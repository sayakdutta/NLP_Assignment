 
 I am scheduled to be in NYC and Danbury, Connecticut as of tomorrow 
 afternoon, through the remainder of the week. I'm assisting with the 
 negotiation of a contract for the purchase of fuel cells.  This is a Jeff 
 Ader/Ozzie Pagan/Heather Kroll deal.
 
 Don't know if you guys like to keep up with such things, but I'm glad to keep 
 you informed.
