 Brudda,
 
 I spoke with Jenn about accommodations in Beijing as well as Shanghai and
 she said her dad is also getting some info from a local Chinese travel
 agent.  How about dropping Dan a line and working with him to recommend &

 
 I believe part of the group is looking to Jon and the other part is looking
 to Dan to make their accommodations for them. I hereby anoint the two of you
 to make the lodging decisions for everyone else, as we are drooling cows
 with no direction or relevant info.  Therefore, the two of you need to get
 together and decide on a hotel (for Shanghai & Beijing), so we can all be
 together and don't have to coordinate getting together everyday in freakin'
 China (i.e. nightmare).  Jon maybe send an e-mail to Dan suggesting a few
 hotels/price/level of accommodations/etc./your recommendation/ and then you
 two make the call and book it for us.
 
 I think the "core" group we should worry about getting
 reservations/accommodations is as follows:
 Shanghai: (arrival on the 5th, Jenn, Eric, Heather, Gayle, Dan, Gerald,
 Barbara) 7 people-3 rooms for the night most likely (Jon you can crash in my
 room)
 Mom & Dad & aunt Jean and Kid arrive on the 6th (2 more room)
 Jeff and Cathy arrive on the 7th (1 more room)
 8th we all fly to Qing dao, hotel in Qing Dao is selected and booked
 Beijing - Everyone listed above is traveling to Beijing as a group.
 
 As far as getting rooms for the other people (Staters, Rassmussen's, etc),
 that's your call, but we are operating without any real good info.  I'd say
 they are on their own as we don't know when they get in, what their plans
 are, etc?  If it's no big deal reserving rooms and not getting dinged if
 noone shows up then maybe get a few extra rooms at certain places, I don't
 know the Chinese hotel system, level of $$ exposure, hotel availability,
 etc., its your call, I'd assume they can probably get a room no problem so
 let's not try to coordinate more people than we have to, they can sleep on
 my floor if they can't get a room in China....
 
 This is what is called Wedding planning lotus bliss...
 
 We are all looking forward to this...
 
 
     
 
 Eric,
 
 Thanks for the info. Will book flight for June 8th and find suitable lodging
 
 in Shanghai. Do you want me to line up lodging in Beijing for you and the
 rest of the entourage?
 
 Let me know, and I'll finish this madness while I'm in Qingdao this weekend
 with our friendly travel agent chum, Zang Bao Guo. Take care.
 
 Chazow,
 
 Jonny Luv
