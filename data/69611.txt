 PHILOSOPHY 101
 
 A philosophy professor stood before his class. He picked up a large empty
 mayonnaise jar and proceeded to fill it with rocks.  He then asked the
 students if the jar was full?  They agreed that it was. The professor
 picked up a box of  sand and poured it into the jar. Of course, the sand
 filled up everything else. "Now," said the professor, "I want you to
 recognize that this is your life.
 
 "The rocks are the important things - your family, your partner, your
 health, your children - things that if everything else was lost and only
 they  remained, your life would still be full. The sand is everything else.
 The small stuff.
 
 "If you put the sand into the jar first, there is no room  for the rocks.
 The same goes for your life. If you spend all your  time and energy on the
 small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are important to
 you."
 
 But then a student took the jar which the other students and the professor
 agreed was full, and  proceeded to pour in a can of beer. Of course the
 beer filled the  remaining spaces within the jar making the jar truly full.
 
 
 The moral of this tale is: That no matter how full your life is,  there is
 always room for BEER.
