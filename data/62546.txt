 Hey John,
 
 Greg Johnston was recently given a copy of the Settlement, Assignment and Assumption Agreement Number 3 between Enron Canada Corp., PG&E Energy Trading, Canada Corporation and Duke Energy Marketing Limited Partnership which you signed on ECC's behalf as of January 25, 2001.  In order to avoid having to recirculate the agreement, I have amended the attached resignation to be effective as of January 31, 2001.
 
 Unless you anticipate signing more agreements on behalf of ECC, please sign the attached document and have Kim return the original to me for the minute book.  
 
 Thanks,
 
 Mark
