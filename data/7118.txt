 
 Frank was excited about his new rifle. So, he went bear hunting. He
 spotted a small brown bear and shot
 it. There was then a tap on his shoulder, and he turned around to see a
 big black bear. The black bear
 said: "You've got two choices. I either maul you to death or we have
 rough sex."
 Frank decided to bend over. Even though he felt sore for two weeks,
 Frank soon recovered and
 vowed revenge. He headed out on another trip where he found the black
 bear and shot it.
 There was another tap on his shoulder. This time a huge grizzly bear
 stood right next to him.
 The grizzly said: "That was a huge mistake, Frank. You've got two
 choices. Either I maul
 you to death or we have REALLY rough sex."Again, Frank thought it was
 better to
 comply. Although he survived, it would take several months before
 Frankfinally recovered.
 Outraged he headed back to the woods, managed totrack down the grizzly
 and shot it.
 He felt sweet revenge, but then there was a tap on his shoulder. He
 turned around to find a giant polar bear
 standing there. The polar bear said: "Admit it, Frank, you don't come
 here for the hunting, do you?"
