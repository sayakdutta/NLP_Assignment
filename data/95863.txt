 
 I'm glad you cancelled.   I agree that the changes are much broader than we 
 intended.
 
 More importantly, I miss having not played tennis this week, and I'm going to 
 DC this weekend, and likely out next week.  A short interlude but that's all.
 
 On an EEI note, are you/Reliant going to the meeting in Ontario that is 
 addressing contract issues in Ontario (Andy is speaking about EEI).  Are you 
 supporting the use of EEI in Canada.  I think I have our Canadian office 
 convinced to use it with dealers but they would want to "Canadianize" it, 
 thereby creating an EEI Canadian.  Any thoughts.
 
 PS I am going to WSPP meeting just for the day - Mike Small has mentioned 
 playing tennis on Monday morning before the meeting.  Still not going?
