 Our local legal newspaper, The Daily Journal, reported in Thursday's edition
 that the AG will ask a Sacramento Grand Jury to investigate whether "the
 California market was manipulated and profits taken illegally, and whether there
 was fraud against the public".  The story reports that the investigation "will
 begin shortly after July 1" which is consistent with out recent intelligence.
 My guess is you have already seen this basic story because the Journal picked it
 off the AP wire service.
 
 Do you already have some clipping service keeping track of all the stories being
 published out here?  I've assumed you are doing this already, but if not and you
 want to do that, let us know.
