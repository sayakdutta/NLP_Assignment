 Would you be willing to pay for this?  Since he is a Ph.D. and specifically 
 for your group, this should be your call.  Let me know if your business unit 
 agree to pick up this additional cost.

 Ms. Roberts, thanks for the quick reply! I received the offer on Thursday, 
 and I
 am very excited about joining Enron this summer. My research group is
 establishing a long term collaboration with Dr. Kaminski and Dr. Gibner, and I
 hope to help foster this relationship this summer.
 I would just like to discuss one issue that is very specific to my status of
 international student. As an international student, I am required to enroll 
 part
 time at Stanford University during the summer quarter in order to be 
 considered
 eligible for a summer internship ("optional practical training"). The cost of
 the part-time tuition will be approx. $2300 for this academic year. The past
 summer, my employer (AT&T) matched this tuition cost in an effort not to
 discriminate between international and domestic Ph.D. students. The offers for
 summer employment I received this year have also been very flexible in this
 respect. I would like to know if Enron could do the same; it would be of 
 course
 very much appreciated (given the notoriously precarious financial condition of
 Ph.D. students). Yet, to make things clear, please rest assured that my
 acceptance of your offer is not conditioned on your reply regarding this 
 issue,
 and that I intend to be at Enron this summer.
 All the best,
 
           Giuseppe
