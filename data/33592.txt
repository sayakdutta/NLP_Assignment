 
 we have been selling txu 10,000 day on lone star since the 1st.  for tomorrow we are selling them 6,000 instead of 10,000 
 
  
     
 is this incremental or did baseload go down?  if incremental, who did you purchase it from or are we taking down what we're delivering to Kleburne plant?  details please...
