 Chor Lim:
 
 Michelle has completed the draft Contract after consultation with Singapore local counsel, David Yeow, with Rajah & Tann. I will be presenting the contract details to Matt later this week. I have his review scheduled on Thursday, August 2.
 
 You will note that the sign-on bonus and stock options are to be in USD, which is how it was approved here in Houston by Mark Haedicke (EWS Mangaing Director & General Counsel), et al.
 
 Michelle: Please e-mail to Chor Lim the last version of the draft Contract. Thanks.

 Michelle Cash, our in-house employment lawyer here in Houston, has been working on a draft Contract for Matt after obtaining advice from outside counsel (Rajah & Tann) in Singapore.This draft is almost finished, but has not been presented to Matt yet. It would be our preference to use the draft that Michelle has been preparing here in Houston in lieu of the draft attached. As soon as the draft is available, we can send to you.

 Attached is the Employment Agreement for Matthias Lee, for your approval. Do let us know when you have presented to Matt so that we could give him the original to sign and thereafter, send to Houston for your signature.

 Need your advice on the effective date of the agreement. Tentatively, i have used 15 May, given that this is the date for changes in title, salary, etc.
