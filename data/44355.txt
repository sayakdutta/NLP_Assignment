 Dan,
 
 I have not followed through with this guaranty because there is currently a 
 multiproduct, multientity guaranty in place for several Aquila entities.  HPL 
 is already included in the guarantee.  The guarantee is capped at 
 $115,000,000.  Just want to make sure that you are aware of why the request 
 was not finalized.  Is this in line with your view?

 Clement,
  Please review the attached Guaranty as I have modified same.   If acceptable 
 in your view, please proceed with execution.  Thank you for your patience.
