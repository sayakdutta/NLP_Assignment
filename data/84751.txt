 and he told Clint he we just trying to make a living.
 
 Clint responded "Dying ain't much of a livin boy!"
 
 Remember that.  That was awesome.

 Have you guys been following the race for mayor?  There are three candidates:
  the incumbent, Lee Brown, and challengers Jack Terence, and, I'm not making

 I think we all know what ballot to drop, don't we?
