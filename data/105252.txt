 
 Clint Freeland (who is trying to remain optomistic) would like to have 
 signature pages for the forwards executed prior to final negotiation.  We are 
 drafting Bear.  We can print signature pages for CSFB and UBS which are on 
 single pages.  Lehman will be emailed (I think) tomorrow.
 
 Please follow up with me please.  Thanks for your help.  Sara
