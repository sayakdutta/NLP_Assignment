 Potash.  If they are not, then Canadian law may prohibit them from providing 
 a guaranty for a less than wholly owned entity.  
 
 I will provide you my comments to the documents shortly after lunch.

  Gerald,
 
 Any update on that PCS guaranty review?  Exposures are pushing past $20MM, a 
 highly visible exposure.
