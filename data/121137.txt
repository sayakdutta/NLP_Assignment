 
 Darla,
 
 Attached is a spreadsheet we prepared that details August business with Citizens regarding the Griffith deal.  Please use this to prepare your invoice.  Also, please inform me if they do not pay us by the due date.  John Cogan should not be paid until we get paid by Citizens.
 
 Please call me and we can discuss the spreadsheet as there are cells that must be verified against the TW invoice as well as Sitara.  In addition to billing Citizens, the following entries need to be made each month:
 
 1)  payment to John Cogan
 2)  origination to Kim Ward and Chris Foster (50/50)
 3)  payment to EARMS for the $.02 insurance Chris negotiated
 
 These amounts are dealed in the last three columns of the spreadsheet.
 
 There may be some updates to the spreadsheet that will create some prior adjustments but these should be ironed out soon.  Call me when you get a chance.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kim
