 Rod or Karolina will prepare a credit worksheet for an ISDA Master Agreement 
 between ETOL and RMT.  Jorge has a 3-year rate swap awaiting documentation.
 
 Rod/Karolina:  Is there any reason to not use RMT?  Is an ETOL sell-off 
 imminent?  If so, would it be in the near term?
 
 Rhett:  If an ETOL sell-off (in whole or part) is imminent, should the deal 
 be booked in ENA rather than RMT?
 
 Jorge:  The transaction confirm should be an ISDA format.  Also, please 
 verify whether any ETOL deals are on ENA/RMT books and the remaining terms
 
 Thanks..
