 I'm planning on going this weekend. Who else?  Hudge?  
 
 The birds I've seen behind this cold front are not lacking in speed or

 anyway).

 Had a nice weekend with the family down at KC.
 Wrapped up a deposition in San Antonio at at about 1, eat and headed to KC. 
 Arrived at about 4. shot limit at 100 acres. Not alot of birds, but enough. 
 Birds very wise. Had to hide well. Lots of birds across the road feeding in 
 the field, lots hanging out on wire. few moving over our ponds.
 Saw lots of coyotes. 4 at 100acres, two at 500.
 heavy rain at 7 pm. cool front.
 Sheila came down with boys on sat. caught a few fish at 100 acres, shot 7 
 birds. Suprised many still in area with rain and north wind. Harder to hide 
 with two wiggling boys.
 Never got to scout 500 acres, by mark hunted it last weekend according to 
 his note and shot only two birds. I saw a decent number in the area of 
 between our gate and road to Opiela's house. The field across the road from 
 the front gate is stacked with sunfowers. They have not dropped seed yet, 
 still yellow. in a week or so, could draw birds. still lots feeding across 
 road from 100 acres.
 John, saw a few deer tracks around your feeders, and lots of really big pig 
 tracks.
 If someone is going down in the next two weeks, please let me know. I left a
 
 pistol at the house, Ms. Opiela went over and got it for me. She will hold 
 onto it until I can get some one to pick it up.
