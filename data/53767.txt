 
 Norman,
 
 Sorry, I missed the time window you gave me.
 I was tied up in a meeting all day. I shall be available on
 Thursday between 1 and 2 p.m., Central Time, and Friday, 10:00 to 1:00.
 Please, let me know what time is convenient for you.
 
 Vince
  

  
 
 Vince,
 
 I have spoke with William Finnoff, and am very interested in following up.
 I would like to chat with you, together with Jim Nusbaum, Prediction
 Company's CTO, who is also in charge of new business development.
 
 Could we shoot for Tuesday morning, say, 10:30?
 
     Yours truly,
     Norman
