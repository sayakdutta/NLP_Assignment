 Sarah:
 Can you create a spreadsheet summarizing Enron's open futures interest broken 
 down by commodity and broker, including maintenance and initial margin for 
 all commodities (including rates, currencies, gas, crude, etc).  
 Also, can you create a list of all margin financing agreements in place and 
 the rates we pay.
 Thanks,
 John
