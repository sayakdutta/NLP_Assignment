 
 I have attended three ASE's and would be happy to visit with you about my 
 opinions.  I will ask Patti to schedule a meeting.  --Sally

 Sally,
 Cindy Olson said you'd be a good person to talk with on this subject, as 
 someone who has considerable experience with this concept.
 I'm doing some research on the ASE and whether to create something internally 
 for Enron use. The key questions are: which would be the aspects we'd keep 
 and which would be the aspects we'd discard.?
 Can I get 15-30 minutes of your time to discuss in the next week or two?
 
 Tim,
 
 Patti,
 If Sally gives the OK, can you call Stacey on 30945 and set up a time please?
 Thanks
