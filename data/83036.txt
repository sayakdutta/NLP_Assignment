 Scott,
 Is the purpose of this to find potential candidates and if so, wouldn't you 
 want to see who is available within the entire organization?

 Ted,
 
 Jeanie and I met with Scott Neal (VP Gas Trading East Desk)  yesterday and he 
 mentioned that he needs an Analyst as soon as is possible.  Should I contact 
 Jana Giovannini or do you send her our request?  
 
 Thanks,
 Jennifer
