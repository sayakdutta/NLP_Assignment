 
 I was just thinking about emailing you...no I really was.  It's scary, we 
 think alike.  I can't believe I'm leaving tomorrow.  I have soooooo much to 
 do today.  Well a lot of it probably won't get done at this point.  I've 
 pretty much given up on most of it getting done before I leave.   After work 
 I'm going to find a notary so I can drop all this ticket stuff off.  And I 
 have to get my oil changed, and if I have time I'm going to go get my 
 brother's cd.  Oh and I have to pack...can't exactly put that one off any 
 more.  But other than that I'm free this evening.  Do you have French?  
 
 I'll call you later.
