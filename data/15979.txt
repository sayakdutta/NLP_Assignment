 
 Folks:
 
 Having printed the paper, I found out that the file received only contains 
 half the paper.  Worse, the authors seemed to have left a page out of the 
 document they distributed.  You currently have the first half.  As soon as we 
 get a complete version of the paper--including the mysterious missing 
 page--we'll distribute.
