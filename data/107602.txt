 please do an informational interview in the office and see if there is 
 anything EGM could have him do.  He is also going to speak with Jeff 
 Donahue.  Thanks.  Jeff

 Jeff,
 Quick update.  I called Jeff to see if is going to be in NY next week, his
 sec. said that he's out of the office today and apparently not scheduled to
 be in NY next week.  I am hoping that we will talk soon.  No call for Per
 (sp?) in the NY office.  Hope you are well,
 Nat

 Jeff,
 Congratulations on yesterday's earnings release - the market reacted well.
 Feedback I got from a large bank on the street is that they always
 recommend
 buying ENE in the weeks leading up to earings releases.  I don't want to be
 a pain, but you had said to let you know if I had not heard from Jeff by
 today.  I'm happy to be the one to make the call - just let me know.
 
 Halley and Michael's opening was quite successfull and the show is great.
 have fun in London.
 Nat
