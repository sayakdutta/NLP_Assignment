 
 Kate,
 
 Thanks for your message. With all the turbulence going on in Enron
 it's difficult for anybody to leave the office for an extended period of time.
 We shall have to abstain this time and hope to join you in the future.

 Dear Vince and Vasant :
 
 Since you both won't be able to come for our Advisory Committee meeting on
 Dec 7, can you send someone else to come? Please let me know, it is critical for us to have
 someone from your team to come!!   As you can see from the attached RSVP list,
 we have a quite good mix of people to come. FYI, I am attaching an agenda and
 "possible issues" for your review.
 
 Look forward to hearing from you.
 
 Kate
 
 
     
 
 Hi Kate,
 
 unfortunately due to business circumstances, I will not be able to
 attend the Advisory Committee meeting.  Please give my apologies to Paul
 and Howard.
 
 Thanks,
 Vasant Shanbhogue
 Vice President, Research
