 What to Expect From Gun Control
 
  these are the facts right out of the history books
 
  Interesting bit of information.
 
 
 
 
 
  "In 1929, the Soviet Union established gun control. From 1929 to
 
  1953, about 20 million dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were
 
  rounded up and exterminated.
 
 
 
  "In 1911, Turkey established gun control. From 1915 to 1917, 1.5
 
  million Armenians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and
 
  exterminated.
 
 
 
  "Germany established gun control in 1938 and from 1939 to 1945, 13 million
 
  Jews and others who were unable to defend themselves were rounded up and
 
  exterminated.
 
 
 
  "China established gun control in 1935. From 1948 to 1952, 20 million
 
  political dissidents, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and
 
  exterminated.
 
 
 
  "Guatemala established gun control in 1964. From 1964 to 1981, 100,000
 
  Mayan Indians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and
 
  exterminated.
 
 
 
  "Uganda established gun control in 1970. From 1971 to 1979, 300,000
 
  Christians, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up and exterminated.
 
 
 
  "Cambodia established gun control in 1956. From 1975 to 1977, one
 
  million 'educated' people, unable to defend themselves, were rounded up
 
 and exterminated."
 
 
 
  Defenseless people rounded up and exterminated in the 20th Century
 
  because of gun control: 56 million.
 
 
 
  The next time someone talks in favor of gun control, ask them "Who do
 
  YOU want to round up and exterminate?" With guns, we are citizens. Without
 
  them, we are subjects.
