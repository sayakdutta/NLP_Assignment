 I sent a message with information to several different units but no 
 response so far. I think people need a specific need to focus
 and I shall keep the Chicago Partners in mind when a relevant
 project arrives. I shall resend the message with attachments on
 CP in a few weeks as a reminder.

 Vince,
 
 Hope this finds you well.  I am sure you are more than busy but I wanted to 
 see
 where we stand with feedback regarding me coordinating a potential 
 presentation
 by Chris Culp at CP Risk Management.
 
 Regards,
 David
