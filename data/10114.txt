 
 	I am on jury duty Oct. 29th.  Please be sure you are working with Ava to check 
 	my calendar before scheduling a meeting.  Thanks. Lynn
 
  
     
 We have tenatively scheduled a meeting with Lynn to discuss the problems we are experiencing with Amarillo Natural Gas.  The reason it is tenatively is because Lynn has Jury Duty selection on Monday and if picked, she will not be here...maybe!  
 
  Time: 9:00 am
 Place: Lynn's Office
 
 Any questions, please let me know.
 
 Randy
