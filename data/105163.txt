 Dear Sara:
 
 Further to your E-mail below, please find attached hereto preliminary drafts 
 of the memo and the comparative chart with respect to financial trading in 
 Brazil. Please note that both the memorandum and the chart are still being 
 revised by Antonio Felix who will return to you as soon as possible with a 
 final version of the mentioned drafts.
 
 Please find also attached hereto free translation of Brazilian SEC (CVM) 
 Instruction 169, relating to eligibility of foreign investors under Annex IV 
 mechanism.
 
 Kind regards,
 
 Marcelo Rodrigues"
 

 
 
 AFAC - Thank you for your response.  It is difficult for me when I do not hear
 from you since I am not in Sao Paulo but I understand that you were engaged in
 other Enron matters.  I am looking forward to your response since the trading
 issues are not going away (the issues seem to only multiply).  Once "the Enron
 group" has had an opportunity to review, we would like to schedule another
 meeting with you and Marcelo in Sao Paulo.  I look forward to receiving the 
 memo
 and chart.  Thank you and regards.  Sara
 
 P.S.  Please phone or e-mail when you are sending the memorandum.
