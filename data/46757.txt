 I would think adding the name would be adequate; do you agree?

 Pertaining to the email below--I spoke to El Paso this morning about the 
 gty's (there are a total of 3 in question covering financial and physical 
 deals w/ENA, HPL, and EPMI).  They agreed to have those three amended to 
 include the name El Paso Merchant Energy, LP (as they only include Gas, LP).  
 This is what their Legal is recommending in order to have the gty amendments 
 executed ASAP and to make it as clean as possible (since 2 of the 3 gty's are 
 tied to contracts).  Also, the amendments will be made effective as of 
 12/31/00.
 
 Let me know if you think we should ask for completely new gty's.
