 
 Can you get Peter Keohane and Greg Johnston, two attorneys in our Calgary 
 office, edit access to the Master Swap Agreement database.  Please let me 
 know when they have access.  Thanks!

 That would be good.  Peter.
 
 
     
 If you like, I can get you database access that will allow you to review the 
 comments between Legal & Credit.  We do not give this level of access to 
 non-Legal & Credit people because we are trying to limit certain information 
 for client-attorney privilege (not to mention the business people give away 
 our negotiating positions!).  If you would like this level of access, let me 
 know and I will put in a request.  This level of access will also give you 
 edit capability, so you need to be careful not to change things by mistake.
