 Thanks for the update! - In the future, you will need to spell my name 
 completely - there are too many smiller's!
 
 I am planning a trip to San Fran to meet with PG&E (tentatively June 6)  - 
 will make sure I stop by to meet you.
 
 Regards,
 
 Stephanie

 Got a message from PG&E.  Open season will be for 2003 and beyond and they'll 
 be accepting bids up to 30 years.  Will talk to PG&E and get back with more 
 information.  If you having any questions give a holler at 415.782.7822.
 
 Best,
 JEff
