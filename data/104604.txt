 
 We may find out today so hold the Master.  We are waiting for Lehman to 
 revise the confirm and the Lehman trader (Paul Rosica) was going to "clean 
 up" behind his attorney to make sure that there are really not any other 
 changes to the Schedule!  Paul has been traveling for the last two days and 
 should be back in the office today.  Clint Freeland (our trader) will let us 
 know more.  SS

 Sara,
 
 We revised the Master to include the Moody's ratings.  Do I need to send it 
 to Lehman or hold onto it for now?  I think you were going to call the Lehman 
 trader to discuss.
 
 Thanks.
