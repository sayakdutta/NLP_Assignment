 I agree completely and don't have any legal reason not to send the form of 
 L/C we would require.  Unfortunately, given the nature of this transaction we 
 can't use our standard form but will have to beef it up a bit.  Let me know 
 if you're ready to send that and I'll get started on it right away - 
 shouldn't take more than a day or so to get it ready.

 Mark,
 
 FYI: Ram Srivastav is the President of DPC. Can we send DPC the format of the 
 Stdby L/C to advance the credit risk portion? We're not committing to 
 actually putting a derivative in place, just familiarizing them with the 
 necessary tools. The legal risk aspect will be covered when we get their 
 outside counsel opinion sent to us. Please let me know. While I feel strongly 
 that we need to cover all of ECT's bases, especially when dealing with the 
 Indians, I don't want to appear to hold up the process. Let me know what you 
 think.
 
 Marc

 While the legal openions are coming - please continue working the rest of the 
 issues and Dont forget that MSEB has to understand and agree to any of these 
 arrangements.

 Vinayak,
 
 We very much look forward to being able to help DPC mitigate it's fuel price 
 risk by implementing a derivative through ECT.
 
 ECT's counsel has advised me that the format for the Standby Letter of Credit 
 to cover ECT's exposure on the derivatives will be sent to you/DPC as soon as 
 you provide us with an opinion from outside (non-DPC) Indian counsel on the 
 legality of commodity derivatives in India.
 
 Pursuant to the above, please obtain a formal opinion from outside (non-DPC) 
 Indian counsel on the legality of commodity derivatives in India, and send it 
 to myself  at your earliest convenience.
 
 Thanking you in advance,
 
 Marc
