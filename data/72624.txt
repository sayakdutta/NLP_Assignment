 Kay:
 
 Greg Lang called this morning to request financial statements from GE
 Packaged Power, Inc.   
 
 FYI - I have spoken with Estelle Lawrence, our contact at Citibank, and she
 advises that the process must start with one of their sales representatives.
 A sales rep will call me back to get an understanding of the transaction and
 provide an estimate of the required fees.  I will let you know.
