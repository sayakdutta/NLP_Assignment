 Meagan and Michael often have coursages and boutineers that coordinate - maybe only key for the "young set", and not those who buy pens to commemorate a 50th anniversary. White rose will be great if the florist feels like the coordinated thing would be weird.  We will be upgrading dad from a carnation, anyway.  
 
 You know in the end, whatever you arrange will be terrific.  I don't mean for these comments to sound picky or ungrateful!!  (I am saving that in full force for later life -- only kidding!) --Sally 
 
  
     
 Got ones with white orchids--but the lily of the valley would be an
 additional $60--what do you think?  Got a white rose for dad.
