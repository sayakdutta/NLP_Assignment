 PS Of course I came in to the office.  I've got a conference call with Bob 
 Wright in the next 5 minutes.  What are the odds that we file?

 As I mentioned (or you've heard), a group of us are planning a trip to the 
 Lake Austin Spa, beginning May 4.  I think I will probably stay 3 nights, but 
 the Spa will give us these rates for 2 night stays.  The rates are group 
 rates, but a group only takes 6 people.  I'm going even if we don't get 6.
 
 I will try to block some rooms next week so we hold spaces.  Please let me 
 know if you are interested.
