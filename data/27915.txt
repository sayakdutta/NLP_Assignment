 NN has any assets or operations in Louisiana and therefore should not be 
 subject to the referenced tax.  As far as other jurisdictions, I don't expect 
 that we'd have a problem with in-kind payment as an additional payment 
 option.  On TW, which has no fuel tracker, in kind tax payment probably 
 wouldn't help us.  Northern does have a fuel tracker, however, and might 
 avoid adverse earnings impact from tax volatility if we could pay those taxes 
 in kind and stick them in the tracker.  We probably couldn't do that until 
 the next rate case, however, because all current taxes are built into our 
 base rates at some representative level.

 There is a proposal concerning paying the Louisiana Use (Sales) Tax by using 
 in-kind rather than paying cash.  Please see the attached memo below giving 
 details and asking for your comments:
