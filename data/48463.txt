 Is 2Advance Studios their correct legal legal name?  Is there an Inc. or Corp. or anything there tacked on the end?

 Thanks for the information.  At this time, we prefer to use our form documents.  I understand that Tana is currently working on the NDA for this company, based upon information Erica provided.  As to the form of agreement, I can probably have something by the end of the day tomorrow for 2Advanced.com to look at.  Please let me know what the "agressive" schedule is.
 
 Thanks.

 Hi Mark,
 	As Erica mentioned, we are going to move forward with 2advanced.com to redo the EnronOnline website.  I will be the primary point of contact between Enron and the agency, but please cc Erica Bess as well. Here is the contract and the two-way NDA 2advanced.com sent over.  True to Enron form, we are pushing a very aggressive schedule, so please let me know if you need any other additional information or if I can be of any assistance in any way.

 Please provide me with the necessary information on the company (e.g., contact name, address, etc.).  I'll make sure that we get the confidentiality agreement moving forward.
 
 Thanks.
