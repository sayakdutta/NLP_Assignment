 
 That, my man, is the $64 question.  Kim and Rockie are nailing this down 
 first thing monday AM.  The result of our conversation on Friday with Conoco 
 was that if we own it, they want it, and if we don't own it, we'd better not 
 convey it to them.  Clever devils, they are forcing us to determine exactly 
 what it is that we own!  Talk to you tomorrow.  DF

 I am not sure if this piece of pipe was addressed in the last correspondence 
 or not.

 There is a 6" lateral pipeline located in Sec. 34-T18S, R36E, Lea County,
 NM.  If this is part of the deal I will need to see the right-of-way
 documentation for this pipeline.
