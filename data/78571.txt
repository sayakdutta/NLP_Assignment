 Lender's counsel indicated to Caroline that not getting an opinion letter may 
 be acceptable, but it needs to be confirmed.  As for the consent agreement, 
 the one pending issue is whether we will consent to jurisdiction somewhere in 
 connection with actions involving the consent agreement.  Sheila's edits to 
 the document had venue in NY federal court but eliminated the text concerning 
 waiver of forum non-conveniens defense.  We did not present that but rather 
 argued against it in its entirety.  Lender's counsel worked on another deal 
 in which we allegedly agreed to jurisdiction in Delaware.  Need your views on 
 how to address this issue, Kemosabe.  You can do so via email or we can wait 
 until Monday.  Happy Easter and I'll be in tomorrow.
