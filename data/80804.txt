 different printer and if it still doesn't work, get a hard copy.
 thanks,

 Attached is a copy of the revised Transaction Approval Process approved by 
 the Board of Directors on May 1, 2001.  Other than granting approval 
 authority to certain business unit Chief Operating Officers and having 
 approval authority reside with specified positions, rather than specified 
 individuals, all other changes to the previous Transaction Approval Process 
 are non-substantive.
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.
 
 Regards,
 
 Dave
