 I have spoken with Edmund Cooper to follow up regarding access to European 
 power products by U.S. counterparties.  Edmund and Justin Boyd have discussed 
 the issue and determined that they would like to follow an approach similar 
 to our approach for U.S. power products.  U.S. counterparties should be 
 granted read-only access to European power products.  If a specific U.S. 
 counterparty wants to trade European power products, the request for access 
 can be examined on a case-by-case basis.
