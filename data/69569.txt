 
 Here is the latest on our search for a new condo.  Search Over!  Due to the recent drastic fall in the Enron stock price, $90 in Jan. to $8.50 today, we have postpone our search.  So we will have to look for a place to stay.  Rental rates may be too expensive in Vail, so we may have to look else where.  We are off to a late ski season this year, it's November 7th and it is very warm here.   I'll start looking for leads on housing.  I also have a paid trip to Cancun in February the 21st - 24th.  Keep me posted on everything.
  
 
 
     
 
 I just recevied my reply from the Brazilian ski team and it looks like we're on between 16 Feb - 3 Mar.  Let's
 start thinking about when we want to go and get something booked.  Paul, start thinking about where we
 would want to stay in Vail.
  
 Later
