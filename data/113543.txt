 Please save the date!
 
 Recruiting season is almost here and the Analyst/Associate Program has been working hard to make this the best year ever.
 
 We would like to invite all executive leads to a kick-off meeting on September 5th from 2:00 P.M. to 5:0 P.M. at the Doubletree Granger B.  The event will be only for the Executive Leads and the Analyst/Associate recruiting staff.  
 

 
 We look forward to seeing you all there.
