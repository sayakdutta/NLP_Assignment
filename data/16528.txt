 Portland desk is a great source of information--Midmarket electricity trader 
 and a very straightforward guy.

 Apparently their credit limit has not been reached.  They haven't been doing 
 any deals, but because PG&E hasn't been online.  I didn't realize that the 
 Portland office only does power sales.  Gas desk is in Houston.  I'll let you 
 know if I find out anything more.

 Thanks.  I was literally just about to call the Portland desk.  You saved me 
 the trouble.  Did they say whether they have any plans to cut PG&E off (from 
 gas sales) in the near future?

 FYI, Mark just walked down to the trading floor, and we have not stopped 
 selling to PG&E.  Apparently, the ISO put out another list and we're on it. kd
