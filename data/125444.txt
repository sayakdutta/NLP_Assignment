 Andy,
 
 Unfortunately, the only stick we have in this game is increasing the total number of subscriptions to a price point whereby NYMEX passes.
 
 We may as well capitalize on this because:
 We can't not sell them terminals (Access will be available if the floor traders want it--  IF THEY WANT IT, THEY WILL GET IT.)
 The large spread traders already know where ENE is at
 Our competitors have been playing the EnronOnline/ floor arbitrage game since day one (it was part on our success)
 
 REUTERS ABILITIES:
 
 1.	Reuters has the right to limit "wall board" availability; NYMEX has the right to buy terminals from Reuters
 2.	Reuters will request "consistency"; in regards to pricing, re-distribution, etc
 3.	Do not have the capability of breaking up the data set
 
 OPINION:
 
 Sell it.  25K per month.  Unlimited enterprise license.
