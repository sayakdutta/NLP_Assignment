 were supposed to go through our year end process.  That's what I have been 
 saying in response to the inquiries I am getting.  Ken, being newly back in 
 the fold, likely didn't know about the process.

 First I heard about this.  I assume it is a reward for the PTC extension.  
 Hope it makes sense to you.
