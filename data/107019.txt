As drafted, I read this as cross defaulting to all other derivative trades between ENA and BSIL, as well as ENE and BSIL.  I don't know if we have any on the books or will enter into any prior to termination of your trades, but the same will be impacted unless you limit the Section 14 definition to your trades only.
 
 
     
 
 
 Attached is the close to final documentation evidencing the 2 trades we've just made with Bear Stearns International. We anticipate signing these either later today or tomorrow.

 Please see the revised documentation.
 
 Thank you.
