 Carolyn,
 
 Happy New Year!
 
 Here is the Citibank Schedule of Fees updated with the "Waived for initial
 setup" and the "F." in Ben's name.
 
 Do you have the wiring instructions yet so I can put them in the escrow
 documents and circulate those docs as final??
 
 Thanks,
  Lari
 
  
     
 Good Morning Lari!
