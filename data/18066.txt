 Would you mind putting it down on paper so I can give it to Lay?  Just two or 
 so bullets of the El Paso accusation and then some bullets on the more 
 fundamental story.

 You got it.  Just give me a call and we'll walk through "the other side of 
 the story."
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Can I talk you or someone else who is close to this into a one pager on why  
 a simple supply/demand explanation of California border prices trumps 
 Carpenter's El Paso dun it conspiracy analysis?
 
 I don't want Lay to be stumped by a question on this at his Wednesday IAEE 
 talk.

 Attached is Paul Carpenter (Brattle Group) preliminary findings that 
 marketers have market power at the border.
 
 By my second email I'm sending Enron's responses to the pleadings at FERC 
 which refute the notion of the need to reinstitute price controls at the 
 California border.
 
 Alternatively, a good argument to high gas prices at the CA border is the 
 message in Stan's natural gas roundtable speech (i.e. high gas prices can be 
 directly attributed to supply/demand factors).

 Fulton, Donna; Lawner, Leslie
  
 FYI.  Presentation by Brattle Group before CA leg committee yesterday in 
 which they assert market power at the CA border (held by "out-of-state 
 suppliers") explains high gas prices in California.  If you have any 
 questions, call me at 415.782.7822.  Please forward to others whom you think 
 might be interested.  Stephanie, could you forward along to Barry?
 
 Best,
 Jeff
