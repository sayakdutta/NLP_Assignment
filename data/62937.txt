 like to receive DSL.

 DSL in your areas is exhausted which means SWB is not even taking any orders 
 for that service at this time.  We can try ordering ISDN to see if we can 
 arrange that service for you.  Please let us know either way if you would 
 like ISDN or not.  Please reply to circuit.provisioning.
 
 Thank you,
