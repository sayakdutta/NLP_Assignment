 I re-compiled Exotica.xll, so that the xcol function is a put on collar.
 
 De-add in your Exotica. Add this special one. And use xcol for put.
 
 Then delete the Exotica_xcol_putoncollar.xll
 
 We will build in this functionality in near future.

 Paulo,
 
 Can you add a flag to xcol function so that we can choose a put or call from 
 the
 spreadsheet ?
 
 Thanks.
