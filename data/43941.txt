  My only comment is that the three references to Enron North America need to 
 be changed to Enron North America Corp.

 Dan,
 
 Ned Crady has reviewed a form of this document earlier.  In this OUC specific 
 copy, I have included ENA.  Phil DeMoes and I are discussing a potential deal 
 with OUC for delivered natural gas into Florida, either via existing 
 infrastructure or LNG.  Please review and provide comments.
