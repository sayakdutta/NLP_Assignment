 hey!
 
 sorry for the delay and thanks for thinking of me.  
 
 i missed you at thanksgiving as well!  canadians celbrate thanksgiving
 in october!?!, but some friends had me over for "american" thanksgiving,
 so i had a good time anyway.  
 
 i'm hoping to catch up with you and kt over the holidays.  i'm planning on
 being on the east coast from dec 16 - jan 3, mostly in northern va.  are you
 going to be in bethesda at all?  also planning a trip up to NY.  
 
 yes, enron is in a bad way.  i'm doing fine, but it hasn't been a pleasant 
 month at work with layoffs and massive uncertainty about future of the
 company.  i've resolved to not worry about it until the new year and it seems
 to be working!  still planning on staying in calgary but who knows?  
 
 let me know about your holiday plans!  
 
 love,
 coop
 
 
  
     
 Hi cooper,
 
 just a quick note, because i don't know if i've
 remembered your email address correctly: we were so
 sad to not see you at our "regular" thanksgiving time.
 :(
 
 i keep seeing horrible things about enron: what is
 going on with you? calgary? your job? your future?
 
 we miss you!
 love,
 meg
