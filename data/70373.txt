 Please keep me updated as well on the expected timing for bringing the LM 
 6000s into the new So American structure.  It needs to be done soon in order 
 to attract the club banks by year end.  Thanks!

 Ben and Brett -
 
 I do not know your target timing to move the LMs; however, you need to be 
 aware that funding from the bank structure to pay for them requires that we 
 go through a full second closing process.  It may take several days to pull 
 together all the documents and information needed for this closing - we will 
 have to deliver Brazil counsel opinions, Cayman counsel opinions, another A&K 
 opinion and deliver a multitude of other corporate and security documents too 
 boring to list here. 
 
 So - as soon as:
 
 1)  the break-out contract is ready; 
 
 2) GE is on board; and 
 
 3) ESA, ENA and WLB have signed off on the purchase option transfer 
 document(s) (which must include Matt,  Mary Kimball and Mary Cilia 
 sign-off),  
 
 we can finalize the "second closing" docs for the bank - we have already 
 started on them, but it will take a focused effort to finish them and receive 
 all signatures necessary.  
 
 Ben and Brett must let Rob Taylor of A&K - at 713-220-4436 know when the 
 above items are complete - he will need to coordinate with the team to push 
 for final docs.
 
 Lisa Alfaro - will you please coordinate with Rob Taylor at the above number 
 and Frederico Porto at A&K in Dallas at 214-659-4447 on the Brazil-based 
 issues? 
  
 I also ask that Ben and Brett be available to the deal team to consult and 
 answer questions as necessary.
 
 I am going to be out of town for a week on another year-end deal and will 
 check my voice mails regularly.   My assistant, Melba Trevino at 835-7664 
 will have my contact details.
 
 Please call Rob, me or Tammy (345-3870) with any questions.
