 Do you have plans for Wednesday evening?
 
 I think Dave Weiner and Chanra (sp?) Sherman have talked with my partner Mark
 Neubauer (whom they know and whom you met here in December) about a dinner
 Wednesday night, and I know that they've been assuming that you and I would be
 part of the group as well.  But it occurs to me that maybe no one talked to
 you about it.
 
 Are you interested?
