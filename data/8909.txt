 pretty large.  I am copying Leslie on this note, as I would like to know the 
 names of the counterparties in the over 90 day bucket and how many dollars 
 are associated with each one -- also how likely we think that collection is 
 in each case.  
 
 Leslie:  I know that it may be that reconciliation is not far enough along at 
 this point to provide this kind of detail, but it is the type of question 
 that Dave may ask.

 Sally - I checked into the number of counterparties that we included in the 
 A/R balances that were being reconciled.  It is 4 as stated below.  Please 
 let me know if you need anything else.  I did deliver copies of they July and 
 August report to Tammie Shepherd.

 Actually, counting the monetized counterparty that we lumped in it would be 4 
 counterparties.

 Brian,
 The answer to your question regarding the number of counterparties in 
 "reconciliation status" on the Delaney Report is 3.  Let me know if you have 
 any further questions.  Thanks
