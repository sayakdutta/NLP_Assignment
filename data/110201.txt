 
 So, any more info regarding the chicks...or I mean ski trip?  As in, what 
 people think of the digs, when people are wanting to go.  My update is that 
 the best weekend for me is the first weekend in March.  As lucky as I am, 
 it's probably the worst one for everyone.  Hey, do you think you could send 
 me emails of all of those going.  I think we should start copying the whole 
 group on correspondance.
