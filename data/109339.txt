 EnronOnline has developed interactive CD's that highlight many of the new 
 features of EnronOnline.  The CD also contains a section called Try a Trade 
 that simulates doing an online trade.  We have these CD's available for 
 distribution to your marketers/traders as well as customers.  We would like 
 to schedule short meetings with each desk to demo and distribute these CD's.  
 
 We also want to offer any assistance we can provide in promoting EnronOnline 
 to your customer base.  We would like to distribute the CD's within the next 
 few weeks.  Please let me (x33310) or Bryan Hull (x39195) know of a time 
 you're available.
 
 Thanks
