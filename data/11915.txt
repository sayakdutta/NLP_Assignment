 
 I received a call from the consultant who performed the archeology survey at 
 stations 1 and 2.  Based upon the plot plan provided by construction, the 
 archeology discovery at station 1 does not occur within the area of proposed 
 impact, even though  part of the discovery is within the facility fence.  The 
 report  recommendation to the SHPO by the archeologist will be that during 
 construction activities in this area, an archeologist be onsite to monitor 
 and ensure that the site is not impacted.  They will also recommend that we 
 fence the discovery area within our facility to ensure that future pipeline 
 activities will not disrupt the site.  
 
 I have asked that two reports be prepared for each site.  One report for each 
 station covering the construction areas and the other reports to include the 
 entire 40 acres at each compressor station.  All four reports will be 
 submitted to Bret Fritch in Omaha on Monday, the 26th of March.
