 Ava can certainly help out where needed.  Thanks. Lynn
 
  
     
 Shelley has never requested anyone to cover for her.  I have asked her before if she required coverage, and she told me no, and its because she is so self sufficient.  If she needs anything, she ususally asks Ava, since she is the closest and I always take my lap top with me.
 
 Have things changed and no one told me?
 
 Thank you,
 Ricki
 
  
     
 Ricki, are you planning on Ava covering for you next week when she gets back? Or is Alma
 covering for you? Thanks. Lynn

 I just wanted to let you know that I will need to leave today around 4:00.  At this time, I don't know the actual flight time for tomorrow,  but it could be as early as 3:30.  I will be on vacation Monday , Tuesday and possibly Wednesday.  I will send out a separate message to everyone once I have flight arrangements finalized.
 
 Sorry for being so evasive, but things are still in a state of turmoil for me.
 
 Thanks for understanding,
 Ricki
