 
 We will not "accept" Kern's termination letter.
 
  
     
 I agree that the deals that the list of open transactions that Kern provided is all inclusive.  I have left a message for Alan Kornicks, Kern, to call me back to discuss the settlement process they have proposed.  Additionally, I will speak with Ed McMichael regarding our ability to settle and what steps need to occur prior to accepting Kern's termination letter.
