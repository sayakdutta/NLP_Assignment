 We will be working this weekend to coreload as many machines as we possibly 
 can.  Please send me your network and lotus notes password.  If we do not 
 have your passwords, I will reset them to password.  We will start with the 
 South facility, and if all goes well, proceed to the north.  Please leave 
 your machine logged on.  NOTE:  If you are an Expedition user, we can not 
 load your machine yet, as the current version of Expedition does not run 
 properly on Windows 2000.  A new version of Expedition will be installed on 
 July 8.
