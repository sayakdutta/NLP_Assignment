 
 Dear Mr. Fulton,
 
 On behalf of Jeff Skilling, thank you for allowing him to consider this 
 opportunity.  Given the current demands on his time, however, he is not 
 interested in pursuing any directorships at present.

 Greetings Jeff, 
 
 I am contacting you to inquire as to your interest and availability for a 
 potential corporate directorship. 
 
 In particular, I'd like to speak to you for a moment about an potential 
 directorship at a British company with annual revenue of $5.4 billion. It is 
 the global leader in education publishing and also has considerable growing 
 interests as a provider of financial information and other media. The board 
 meets seven times a year - three times in London, three times in the US, and 
 once elsewhere. I would be delighted to speak with you on this in further 
 detail if it is of interest and send full information.
 
 If this particular opportunity is outside your interests,? then I would like 
 to take a moment to discuss what types of directorships you would prefer.
 
 Please don't hesitate to contact me at 312-993-0754 or by e-mail. 
 
 I appreciate your time and consideration and look forward to hearing from you 
 soon. 
 
 Best regards, 
 
 Thames
