 Hi Marie, 
 Our attorney has been on vacation most of this month, and unfortunately, we have not had the chance to review of your proposed ISDA documents.  Would it be possible for you to review our docs?  It will certainly help us out since we currently have a back log of unsigned ISDA contracts.  Please advise.
 Thanks, Angie

 ISDA Master Agreement I forwarded to you.  Will you please let me know

 Thanks!
