 
 Greetings;
 
 I've tried to accommodate everyone's comments, but there's still a hole or 
 two.   In addition, seems that the letter would benefit from a bit more 
 editing to make it shorter.  Richard, note that I've left a place holder in 
 the opening paragraph to fill in a summary of our arguments and the 
 conditions under which we'd be willing to produce certain documents.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
