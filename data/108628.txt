 Attached are the final drafts of the resolutions which I will introduce at
 the board meeting tonight.  Of course the resolutions will be contingent on
 the transfer of stock and I hope you will feel free to call me if you have
 any problems with the transfer or if I can help in any other way.
 
 I do hope you will send me some language and a photo for an appropriate
 article in the bulletin.  I would like the congregation to know about your
 generosity and the importance of our youth leadership programs.
 
 Thank you again for everything. I look forward to seeing you on the 30th.
