  In response to your phone call,  our Master is for firm delivery only
 and as such will not accommodate interruptible service.  If you wish to
 put a Master in place, our credit department will need some information.


 
 Finally,  I will be happy to send our GISB with special provisions if
 you so desire. 
 
  
 Regards,
