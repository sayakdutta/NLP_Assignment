   HOUSTON -(Dow Jones)- Cove Point LNG Limited Partnership, a subsidiary of
 Columbia Energy Group (CG) Friday completed its open season for firm liquid
 natural gas (LNG) tanker discharging service at its Cove Point terminal near
 Lusby, Md., the company said.
 
   Cove Point LNG executed binding agreements with Coral LNG Inc., El Paso
 Merchant Energy-Gas, LP (EPG) and a subsidiary of BP Amoco Corp. (BPA).
   The three customers will begin service agreements upon receipt of regulatory
 approvals.
 
   The open season process for the proposed service began Feb. 16, with the new
 service providing 4.25 billion cubic feet of storage capacity and 750 million
 cubic feet per day of terminal and pipeline capacity to accommodate LNG
 imports by the three companies.
 
   The open season agreements also provide for a 2.5 Bcf (vapor equivalent)
 storage capacity expansion of Cove Point's Lusby, Md. location.
 
   Cove Point anticipates filing an application with the Federal Energy
 Regulatory Commission to provide the LNG tanker discharging service, to
 recommission Cove Point marine facilities and to construct new storage
 facilities including the new LNG storage.
 
   Columbia Energy Group agreed to sell partnership interests in Cove Point LNG
 Limited Partnership to Williams Cos. (WMB) subsidiaries for $150 million. The
 transaction should be complete in July, the companies said Friday.
