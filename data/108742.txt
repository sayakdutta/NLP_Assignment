 Jeff,
 
 Just wanted to confirm that Li will be placed in Vince Kaminski's group.  
 Vikas has been placed in ENA Middle Market reporting to Craig Breslau.  
 Please contact me at 3-4584 if you have any questions.  Thanks for your help!!

 Shelly, 
 
 Hunter spoke with Li today and agrees that her first rotation should be in 
 Vince's group doing modelling, etc.  This will give her the broadest 
 experience for a first rotation.  I'm sure the other person in question, 
 Vikas, will do very well in Hunter's group.  
 
 Thanks for your help.
 
 Jeff
