 Let's meet at Westin Oaks next to the reception around 6:30 p.m. Thursday.
 There are several nice restaurants within a walking distance to the Galleria.
 I shall make a reservation (is Italian or a steakhouse OK?). 
 
 You can reach me on Thursday at my cell phone 713 410 5396.
 
 Look forward to meeting you.

 Great!  I look forward to our dinner on Thurs. 12/7 evening.  Hopefully your
 flight will be on time... although having watched 60 minutes last night and
 suffered from a # of delays lately, let's hope that the "weather blame"

 on Thurs., 914 253 4187, ... I can easily check it in Houston.
 

 that I can book (& for what time)??  Coming over to down town won't be a
 problem for me either.
 
 Will be great to see you again.

 Soussan,
 
 Thanks for your message. It would be great to meet you when you come to
 Houston.
  I shall be in town on December 7,  flying back from Philly in the morning.
 Assuming that the flight is on schedule, I shall be available for dinner.
 Please, let me know how I can contact you on Thursday, December the 7th,
 to confirm.
 
 Look forward to meeting you.

 Dear Vince,
 
 Greetings from NY and hope that all is well and you had a great
 Thanksgiving.  I'll be coming to Houston for 12/6-12/7 and hope you are
 available either evening for dinner.  Would be great to see you again and
 catch up with the latest... I really enjoyed my visit last April, your
 insights, and the risk book you gave me.
 
 I do hope you're available to meet and pls let me know which evening suits
 you better.
 
 Best,
