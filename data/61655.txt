 
 Can you type up thank you letters for me.
 
 
 Dear xxxx
 
 I would like to thank you for your generous donation to The Order of Good 
 Cheer fundraising effort.  Our organization raised over $200,000 for the 
 Enviros Program.  The money was much needed and will allow this wonderful 
 program to continue to improve the lives of young Calgarians who have 
 experienced hardship.
 
 Yours Truly
 
 
 
 
 
 John Lavorato.
