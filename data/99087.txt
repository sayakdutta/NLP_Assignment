 Richard-
 
         As I mentioned in a voice mail I left a little earlier, Iam currently 
 looking for a position in litigation, with a preference for some work in the 
 appellate area.  Kristina Mordaunt and David Koogler suggested that I contact 
 you to see if there is anything presently available.  I am taking the liberty 
 of attaching a resume and list of reported decisions so you can see my 
 background.  If you don't mind, I will try to call you the first part of next 
 week.  If you would like to talk before then, I can be reached at 
 713-754-6300.
 
         Thanks for your consideration.
