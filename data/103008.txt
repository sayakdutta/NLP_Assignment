 Other deals is fine,
 
 Build route has been selecting the hourly deals just fine, and including them in the off peak sections. We must be able to see these deals, as we have a great many deals with odd hours and shaped schedules.
 
 Thanks,

 Hi,
 
 We are categorizing the deals in Build Route depending on type of the deal:
 
 If the deal strip is during Peak hours, Build route includes theses deals in On Peak deals section
 If the deal strip is during Off-Peak hours, Build route includes these deals in Off-Peak deals section
 If the deal strip is for 24 hours, Build route includes these deals in 24Hour Section deals
 
  We are observing few deals strips only for few hours and not follows any of the above mentioned sections, they are not part of any Peak/OffPeak/24Hour section, and Build route is not selecting these deals.
 I am proposing to add one more section called "Other Deals" and to include all these deals in this section. 
 
 Please let me know, if you have any questions/suggestions/comments in this regard. 
 
 Thanks,
 Vish
