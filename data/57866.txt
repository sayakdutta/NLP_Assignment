 budget to pick up a partial headcount.

 Cindy and Steve:  Please see Kathy Mayfield's split responsibility proposal.  
 She initially discussed it with Jean Ryall at the beginning of January just 
 prior to the start of the legislative session.  Unfortunately, Jean has not 
 responded to Kathy's numerous inquiries.  As you can see, Community Relations 
 can use Kathy for United Way, but that will account for only 40% of her time, 
 with 60% designated for legislative/economic development activities under 
 Jean.  Please let me know your thoughts on how to proceed.  I am nervous 
 about a full-time role for Kathy should Jean not be interested in supporting 
 these activities and want to make sure that her talents are optimized for 
 Enron.
