    I saw that in USA Today as I was getting on a plane this moring.
 
    I tried to send you an email to enron.com day before yesterday and
 it
    was returned saying it didn't exist.  Curious.

    Looks like due to the Enron debacle, you guys can make some
 money...On
    Ebay the cups I sent you are going for $50 and higher.  Make your
 money
    while you can.
