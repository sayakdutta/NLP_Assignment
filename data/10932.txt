 Dear Sandra and Kenney,
 ?
 I wanted thank you both for having me over for  dinner on Friday.? I had a 
 great time and I  am so glad that I finally got the chance to meet Kenney 
 and  Samantha.?
 ?
 That Samantha is a doll.? She is certainly a  miniature Sandra.? She has that 
 bubbly personality just like her  mom.
 ?
 I look forward to seeing you guys again  soon.
 ?
 I am off for Atlanta first thing Monday  morning.? 
 ?
 Pam
