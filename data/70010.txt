 Hello Kay,
 
 Steve Plauche asked me to send you a copy of the current agreement with ENA
 cited in the work order request for the Connecticut project.  You will note
 the agreement expires at the end of this month.  Please fax the signed work
 order to my attention at 978 266-4098 today as Steve has directed us to
 begin work immediately and attend a meeting tomorrow.  Also, it would be a
 great help if you could provide a letter extending the term of the agreement
 to October 2001.  Please call me if you have any questions.
