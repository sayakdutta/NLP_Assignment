 	to have someone covering your desk.  Thanks. Lynn

 Lynn, I need to take a 1/2 a day vacation on Monday, September 24th to leave at noon and I would come in early that day too and 1/2 a day vacation on Tuesday, September 25th I would be in the office at noon time.  I would like to go to a cousins wedding out of town and I've put it off because of the move but am being harassed by family but if it's not possible that's okay.
 
 Thanks,
 Ava
