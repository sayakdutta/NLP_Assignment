 not familiar with the frequency of our trades, but I'm sure Laurel can fill 
 in the blanks.  I thought that the process being implemented by the EMTA 
 seemed reasonable but let me know if this is a fallback that you would agree 
 to use if the PTAX rate is not available for settltment.  Thanks.  Sara

 Sara,
 
 Previously we have agreed upon "CURRENCY REFERENCE DEALERS" as the first 
 disruption fallback, and ""CURRENCY MUTUAL AGREEMENT" as the 2nd disruption 
 fallback.  It appears that EMTA has created a "BRL Industry Survey Rate" 
 (BRL11).  Merrill feels that this definition is replacing the Currency 
 Reference dealers definition--or at least setting out a clear methodology for 
 determining the rate.  Also, Shari always preferred that we use the mutual 
 agreement rather then calculation agent determination of settlement rate.  
 The ISDA template defaults to Calculation Agent.  Do you prefer that we 
 continue on asking people for mutual agreement, or are you o.k. with 
 Calculation agent determination of settlement rate?  Trading has no 
 preference on that matter.  
 
 I am faxing you a current ML non-deliverable deal with this new language in 
 it for your review.  Please let me know if the confirm is o.k. to sign, or if 
 you have any issues we need to address.  
 
 Thanks!
 
 See the below attachments for the new definition and the history surrounding 
 it.

 Hi Laurel,
 
 Please take a look at the following documents sent by EMTA.  Only difference
 is that we have not included the "unscheduled holiday" provisions as there
 has not been a clear cut consensus among counterparties whether to use
 Preceding or Following.
 
 Please contact me if you have any problems.
 
 I will try to sort through my e-mails if I find additional information on
 the BRL templates.
 
 Thank you
