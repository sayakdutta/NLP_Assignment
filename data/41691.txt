 How are things up your way?  It's incredibly busy here--entering into numerous master netting agreements.  Hope things quiet down soon.  I can't take much more of this turmoil!
 
 Anne got her fabric from Schumacher Saturday.  Do you have an invoice or will you let us know the total when you get one?  There wasn't an invoice included in the package.  The toile is so pretty.
 
 Thanks!
