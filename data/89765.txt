 
 We are not to discuss credit issues with any counterparties.
 
  
     
 Just spoke to one of their traders.  Their credit is (as are all of our counterparties) conducting a credit review.  As of this morning, they are not putting on any trading restrictions with us.  They have discussed implementing a netting agreement, but we have responded that we will not, especially without updating the current enabling agreement with a EEI (which they are opposed to).
 
 Keep you posted.
