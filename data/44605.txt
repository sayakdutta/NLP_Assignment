 
 Why is an attorney doing secretarial work, much less paralegal work?  Also, 
 she is primarily a litigator, and we have found that litigators don't know 
 anything about contracts, securing collateral, corporate law, etc.
 
 If we want a litigator, I understand that one of the old time 20 year 
 Liddell, Sapp litigation paralegals has finally gotten to a place where she's 
 ready to leave...
