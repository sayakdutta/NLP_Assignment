 Hey Jeff,
 What a surprise -- yesterday I was looking at the latest "Berkeleyan" and 
 on page three there you were!  Have you seen the picture?  It is from the 
 electricity summit.  It is a picture of you and a guy that looks like Burl 
 Ives -- It sort of looks like he is telling you an off color joke.  (It 
 also says that you are director of enron corp.!)  Anyway, it was great 
 treat to see you in the local rag.  Brightened my day.
