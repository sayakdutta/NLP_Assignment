 Coping With Job Stress
 
   At a seminar called "Stress and Disease"  by Dr. Nickolas Hall, an
 expert in psychobiology, gave an example of a coping skill for job
 stress which I would like to share with you.
 
   When you have had one of those "Take This Job and Shove It" days,
 try this:
 
 On your way home after work, stop at your pharmacy and go to the
 section where they have thermometers. You will need to purchase
 a rectal thermometer made by "Q-tip". BE SURE THAT YOU GET
 THIS BRAND! When you get home, lock your doors, draw the drapes,
 and disconnect the phone so you will not be disturbed during your
 therapy.
 
 Change to very comfortable clothing, such as a sweat suit, and lie
 down on your bed. Open the package containing the thermometer,
 remove the thermometer and carefully place it on the bedside table
 so that it will not become chipped or broken.
 
 Take the written material that accompanies the thermometer and as
 you read it, you will notice in small print the statement that says,
 "Every rectal thermometer made by Q-tip is PERSONALLY tested."
 
 Now.... close your eyes and say out loud five times, "I am so glad that
 I do not work in quality control at the Q-tip company."
