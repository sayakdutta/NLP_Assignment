 could not trade physical power because they do not have a power marketing 
 license.  It perhaps might be possible for them to purchase US power only.  
 If they want to enter into power transactions he is going to need to get you 
 a name and phone number of someone at Engage that you can talk to to get 
 evidence of their power marketing license.

 Stephanie/Tana,
 
 Could you please expedite the following amendment the profiles of Engage 
 Energy America LLC and Engage Energy Canada L.P. as soon as possible this 
 morning.  Paul Radous is opening both of these entities up to trade all US 
 East and West Phys Power products and I have made the changes in Profile 
 Manager.
 
 Thanks for your help !
