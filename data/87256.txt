 I have attached a worksheet for a master physical for one of Nelson Ferries' 
 counterparties.  He is visiting the counterparty next week and has requested 
 that the draft contract be delivered to him by the end of this week.  Sorry 
 for the rush job.  Please let me know if I can do anything else from here.  
 If you have any questions, give me a shout.
 
 Thanks,
 
 John
