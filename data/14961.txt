 
 Thanks of your words of encouragement.  
 
  
     
 Let me point out, this is NOT sucking up.  
 
 However, congratulations on your new endeavor.
 
 I know it's too early to consider, but in the future, if you decide there is a position available in your new group, please consider me.
 
 Don't get me wrong, I'm not unhappy where I am, just seeking opportunities to expand.
 
 I bring 28 years experience in a variety of areas both in TW and NNG including Contracts, Scheduling, and Gas Control.
 
 Again congratulations and good luck.
