 We need to get a nomination form signed by you & Vince.  Once we have this 
 you guys can discuss the figures with Steve and once everything is agreed we 
 will get the nomination form signed by Sherriff and the agreement drawn up.  
 
 I will get one up to you today / tomorrow.

 Sophie- what do we need to do to implement this?
 
 Vince - do you want to go through this with Steve while he's in Houston?

 I think it's a fair deal.

 Both,
 
 Thanks for your comments and comparisons, it is good to get context.
 
 Based on your comments here would be my proposal
 
 o63,500 basic salary - 
 o15K kickers for each of the 2 years - These are paid as a lump sum on each 
 anniversary guaranteed.  Therefore guaranteed salary is effectively o78,500 - 
 this is completely separate and in addition to any performance bonus
 Increase the value of options to o60K  to vest 1/3 as before - which leaves a 
 1/3 ($20,000 ) hanging out there at the end of the contract.  
 
 Just FYI - Anjam is currently on o68,000 but does not have an agreement, so 
 this would effectively put a 10.5K gap between the two.  
 
 Let me know your thoughts.

 Sophie,
 
 Here's Vince's comments on your proposal for Steve.  Also, what's a 2-Yr 
 Exec?  How do the kickers work - are they basically a guaranteed minimum 
 bonus or incremental bonus?

 Dale,
 
 Thanks for your message.
 I don't know the labor market  in London that well but here the market
 for quants is very hot.  Steve is in my view an exceptionally talented person
 and I would go an extra mile to retain  him long-term for the company.
 
 I would adjust the base salary or the kicker upward a bit.
 o62,000 Basic  is what Anjam is receiving currently  (if I remember 
 correctly). Steve has a much higher value
 to Enron than Anjam.
