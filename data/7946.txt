 
 In a meeting with Louise Kitchen today, she mentioned that Bob Superty was 
 very impressive in a presentation that he made to the Peoples Energy Board of 
 Directors on Wednesday.  She was very complimentary.  I have let Bob know 
 about Louise's praise.  Thought that you would like to know as well.
