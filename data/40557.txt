 I think it may eventually be appropriate, but I would prefer not to do it r=
 ight away.  My team has had a bad experience with Global Finance over the y=
 ears.  They have always had an arrogant attitude and often did deals involv=
 ing our assets without consulting or even involving the commercial team res=
 ponsible for the asset.  Kevin is going to need to overcome this and demons=
 trate that he is coming in to behave differently.  It is very important to =
 me to have a centralized analytical team so that I know there is consistenc=
 y, independence and thoroughness in the analytics related to the EGAS busin=
 esses.  I have learned the hard way that analytical groups under the contro=
 l of a commercial team sometimes produce lower quality results. I also like=
  to have a single point of contact for other parts of the Enron organizatio=
 n that want or need models, valuations and analytics.  Again, historically =
 I have seen disastrous results when there are multiple sources of informati=
 on relating to any given project.
 
 I do think it makes sense to describe Louie Fischer's relationship to Kevin=
  as a dotted line and then we can reevaluate over time.  I would also sugge=
 st that prior to or immediately following an announcement you have Kevin go=
  meet with each manager of a significant business (namely Pete and Mariella=
 ) to introduce himself and describe how he is going to fit into the organiz=
 ation.  I also think he needs to make that introduction interactive and do =
 some listening not just talking.  He will ultimately find them more coopera=
 tive and trusting if he makes an effort to assure them that he is part of t=
 he team and not just a finance guy trying to get his name on a deal and ear=
 n a big bonus.

 I am getting ready to announce that I am bringing Kevin Howard into EGS as =
 Vice President of Finance and Transaction Support.    Thinking about the cu=
 rrent organization, do think it appropriate to consider putting Ms Fischer =
 in his organization?   The kind of things she is doing for you currently ar=
 e similar to the kind of things we are going to have Kevin working with Cor=
 p on.   I will be putting into his organization the economic analytic talen=
 ts and special projects people from the pipeline group as well as some othe=
 rs.    We will not be charging out these costs into the specific commercial=
  units, but instead expect them to generate the ideas and value to pay for =
 themselves.    His group will be providing services to all, but I am willin=
 g to carve out some priorities.
