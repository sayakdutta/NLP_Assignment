 Is this a problem on NN also???

 In representing to participants at the TW Options technical conference that 
 shipper call options will not be sold on capacity that is subject to a ROFR, 
 our underlying assumption (I believe) was that capacity subject to a ROFR 
 isn't posted as generally available either.  Jeff, Lorraine and I just 
 learned that this is not the case.  Our "generally available" posting system 
 does not distinguish between capacity rolling off of a contract and capacity 
 that is subject to a ROFR; all it recognizes is the expiration of the initial 
 contract term.  Therefore, we have capacity posted on our website that is 
 subject to the current shipper's ROFR and that is therefore not really 
 available.  We found this out when a shipper called asking about some posted 
 space.  Jeff's initial reaction was "no, that space isn't available."  But 
 when we checked the posting, there it was.  The commercial people instantly 
 recognized it as space currently subject to a contract that contains a ROFR.  
 
 My recommendation is that we modify the posting procedure to NOT post 
 capacity until we know that capacity is unsubscribed after we jump thru all 
 the ROFR hoops.  The premature posting of that capacity is, at best, 
 confusing to our customers who might count on getting the space by bidding 
 maximum rate.  I realize that modifying our system might involve additional 
 time and cost, but I think it's misleading to leave it as is.  Please let me 
 know whether you concur.
