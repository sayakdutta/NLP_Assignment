 Thanks,

 Mike, here is a very brief overview of planned or approved expansions by major pipeline.  There is a lot of detail that supports each of these pipe expansions including, proposed start dates, delivery points, probability etc... 
 
 Let's discuss needs... 
 
 Perhaps, we can give your group a general overview on expansions in the west, current status etc.
