 
 Andrea Bertone forwarded the recent memo about the new Brazilian Regulatory 
 Affairs' Database.  I can access the index through Enron's intranet but I 
 receive the message that Netscape cannot acces the address 
 "http://ei-sp-01/regulatory" when I try to access one of the six parts of the 
 database.  I am an ECT user (not Enron Development).  Can you help me to 
 access the site or tell me what I need to do to view legislation, documents, 
 etc.?  Thanks very much.  Sara
