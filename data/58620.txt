 will be important.  To date we have been relying on legal analysis of 
 required approvals etc.  That information is essential but it is, as you 
 know, about 10% of the issue.  The far more critical considerations are how 
 is the government likely to react on a political level and what can we do 
 about it.  I think our government affairs people are in the best position to 
 make these assessments.

 I have reviewed the most recent IM and don't have any significant comments, 
 but my review did highlight the need to have a set or sets of 
 eyes(internally) who understand the regulatory overlay of the Southern Cone 
 better and who are also in a better position  ( physically and with language 
 skills ) to assess the  nature of the regulatory approvals needed and to 
 effectively pull on a set of local resources when this project begins to take 
 shape- With all of that in mind, I would recommend we , at the very least, 
 bring Jose into the loop. I intend to stay actively engaged and do whatever I 
 can, but we need help immediately on the regulatory front - the last thing I 
 would want to have happen to the project would be have it held hostage at the 
 governmental approval stage-  being proactive now by bringing Jose over the 
 wall would be my strong recommendation.Please advise.
