 The following two invoices don't have work orders setup:
 
 1.  Bracewell & Patterson Re:  Berry Group, Ltd. and Berry Contracting, LP v. 
 Enron North America Corp.
  Amount:  $6,900.00
 
 2.  Weil, Gotshal & Manges Re:  ENA/Perry Gas
  Amount:  $108.00  (Invoice #1009176B)
                    $352.50  (Invoice #10013082B)
 
 Should these be coded to General Litigation or do you want me to set up new 
 work orders?  If so, who should they be allocated to (Team Leader)?
 
 Thanks,
