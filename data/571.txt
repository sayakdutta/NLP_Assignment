 
 Thanks for the update on the foundation design.  The clubhouse floorplan looks good.  
 
  

  
 We talked to Bob Braden about designing the foundations using the geottech
 information that we was done previously so as not to delay the permitting
 process. He said that he would do a preliminary design for permitting only
 and as soon as he gets the new geotech information showing the actual
 borings where the buildings are actually going to go, he will revise his
 foundation designs. He is in the process of sending us a revised proposal
 showing the additional costs to do this extra designing. Any questions,
 please call me. Thanks.
