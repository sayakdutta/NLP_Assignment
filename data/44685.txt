 702/259-2323.  But I went home sick.  I'll call you tomorrow?  Or if you
 need help immediately, you can call Joe Boyle 9703/259-2311.
 
 Thanks

 Lisa,
 
 I was returning your phone call to Carol St. Clair about the agreement and
 deleted the message by mistake before I got to your phone no.  Can you give
 me a call at (713) 853-3399.  Thanks!
