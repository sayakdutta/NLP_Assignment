 
 i will be in nd.  i think my plane lands 10 min. after yours.  avs got worked last night.  i don't have a good feeling about the series now.  they had no answer for the defense.  
 
  
     
 I am going to work on site at a conversion building. It should be a good pay
 increase and I will get a ton of experience. I only have to work 11-6. I'll
 have to work weekends but have a couple of days off during the week. I have
 to work the Bronco games this year, Damon said he had to work them last year
 on another project so it is my turn. I'll just bring a little TV in to
 watch. It should be pretty cool. Are you going to N. Dakota in a couple of
 weeks?
 
 
     
 
 i am excited to watch it.  so you got a promotion at work?  that is good
 news.  what is your new job going to be?

    They looked unbeatable. The Devils looked like shit but if the Avs play
    like
    that, there is no way they will be beat. Tonight will be a big game.
 
    
                 
 
    nintendo doesn't count for your handicap.  how about the avs.  that was
    the
    most impressive game they have played all post season.
