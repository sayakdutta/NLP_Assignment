 
 Morris and Elaine are responsible for this area of the ETS world and as such 
 should be there and hopefully will know what this is about.     I have seen 
 nothing on this proposal and probably will not be available, as I have a PRC 
 on that date, out of the office.

 A meeting concerning the above subject is schedule for 2pm with Stan Horton 
 on Thursday, December 14th.  Please try to arrange your schedules to attend, 
 as Stan's schedule is not flexible.  
 
 Please confirm your attendance by email or voice mail to me by tomorrow, so I
