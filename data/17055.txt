 
 Got everything off of Izio.  I'll start messing with it and report back 
 tomorrow.  If others want to do the same, have at it, and we can compare 
 notes.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 How about talking Monday pm?
 
 There were a ridiculous amount of handouts again on Thursday, some of which
 directly related to next week's assignments.  I thought the quiz was
 straight forward enough.
 
 Mark - my mom and I were going to go to the Pottery Barn Kids in Corte
 Madera on Saturday, so perhaps we could stop by your house to drop off
 copies of the handouts on our way in or out.  Send me directions again to
 your house if you would.  
 
 I'm not sure how we can get copies to you Jeff.  I could drop them off to
 your place in SF if that works.  Let me know.
 
 Thanks,

 Jeff, Mark:
 
 Wondering where you were yesterday. Hope you didn't
 forget about the in-class quiz!
 
 The next HW and writeup due next week seems like
 a heavy one.
 Do most of you have Monday off? I'll take a look at the
 case/HW Sa/Su, and prefer a meeting / conf call anytime
 Monday. Perhaps PM in the city if folks are working
 that day? Sunday PM (after 7) works for me too.
