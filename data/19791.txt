 
 Thanks, Geoff.  May make sense to loop back with the woman at the PUC who contacted Jim originally about this account. Jim's been in contact with her before about some confusion with a UC account.  Jim was out yesterday and today, but I think that he'll be in tomorrow.  He may want to make the contact.  Jim, thoughts?
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 All,
 I spoke with the customer, Mike Benson. He is not angry, but he would like his accounts returned to bundled service. He understands that we are implementing a large contract with SBC Corp Real Estate, and that it is possible more of his accounts are inadvertantly on the list.  He knows to contact me directly with future issues. I submitted the deal sheet to de-DASR the 2 accounts he identified to Samantha Fite a few moments ago.
 I have also notified the SBC contracts manager of the situation.
 Let me know if there are any questions or concerns.

 Yes, I will keep you all posted.  I placed a call to the customer at 7:30 this morning, but have not heard back from them yet.

 Thanks, Lamar.  Geoff, could you let us know how it goes with the customer and if this a mix-up on the customer's end.  Thanks very much.
 
 Best,

 Lamar -- who is the client rep for Pac Tel?  Can they get into Pac Tel and try and find out if we have done something inappropriate?  We need to call this guy back by Monday EOB.  Please let Jeff Dasovich know so he can call Joyce back - I'll be out on vacation next week.
