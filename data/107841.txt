 I know what you mean.  let's figure out when we both have some free time and 
 maybe we can go to a fun dinner and blow off some steam.  
 
 
    
 I think my head spun, then exploded.  Ditto on the busy part!  Trying to get 
 Max and Chloe ready for their departure Friday, meeting with contractors, and
