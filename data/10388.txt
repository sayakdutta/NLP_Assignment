 All,
 After talking it over with Lynn Blair, and with Sheila Nacey's agreement, the TMS Oncall support hours are being modified.  Instead of the current rotation that requires 2 developers to be oncall each working day plus a third person fulfilling the responsibility on the weekend, the TMS team is experimenting with a rotation of one oncall person for work days and one for the weekend.  The TMS team will still continue to provide oncall support from 6:30A to the end of the last cycle.
 
 The only noticeable change during this 6 week experiment will be the onsite support hours, which will now be from 6:30A to 6:00P.  Following is an outline for oncall procedure during this period:
 
 1)  Designated TMS Oncall will provide on-site support from 6:30A to 2:00P
 	At times when the Oncall does not feel comfortable about being able to commute to office before 6:30A, the Oncall will 	provide support from home until he/she is able to hand off the responsibility to TMS team member onsite.
 2)  TMS team, collectively, will provide the on-site support from 2:00P to 6:00P
 	Before leaving, the Oncall person will make sure that one of the team member, already on-site, has accepted the 	responsibility for answering oncall pages
 3)  Designated TMS Oncall will provide off-site support from 6:00P to the end of processing for last cycle
 
 There will be no change to the weekend oncall procedures.
 
 John/Terry,
 please make sure that all schedulers are aware of the above change.
 
 Please let me know if you have questions or concerns.  
 
 Thanks
