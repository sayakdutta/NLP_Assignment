 never been to a better event or had as much fun.  I'll be calling Roberts.

 Mike,
 
 Congrats to the Sooners! With that impressive victory (what a defense) OU now 
 has seven national championship in football, which surpasses Wichita State's 
 six national championships in bowling. Wanted to put it in perspective. Only 
 downside to last night is that soon you will be getting an alumni bill to pay 
 for Bob Stoops new contract. I sure hope you use this opportunity to call 
 Roberts and give him hell about his whining Canes. Did you see their mascot 
 get in trouble?
 
 I'm due to meet with you next week on Wednesday, January 10 at 2:00pm. See 
 you there.
 
 Happy New Year,
 Doug
