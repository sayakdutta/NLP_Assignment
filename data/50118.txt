 
 Sean,
 
 I think we should  invite Bruce for additional interviews. I think that he 
 does not have 
 the skills required in my unit, but he could contribute in other areas.
 
 Here is the list of potential interviewees:
 
 John Echols
 Ted Murphy
 Mark Ruane
 
 Vince

 documents for your hard copies.  If you have any questions, or conflicts of 
 schedule, please do not hesitate to contact me.
