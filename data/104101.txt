 brokerage/futures agreements.  Attached are our most recent matrices by Enron 
 company.  ALL of these agreements are negotiated by legal and must be 
 executed by the business unit (VP or higher) and Ted Murphy.  Sheila Glover 
 always sends a request and explanation for new account to legal, compliance 
 and Ted Murphy.  Legal keeps a comprehensive listing by Enron company in an 
 effort to avoid confusion.  Legal updates authorized trader lists and trading 
 resolutions.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Sara
