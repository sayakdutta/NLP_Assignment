 John,
 
 Here are the simulations for:
 
 Normal roll:  (same as before, but included for completeness)
 No Roll: (liquidate position at end of each month)
 Roll to fill price gap
 
 I have included in place of the Roll P/L, the cumulative price gap over all 
 the contract rolls ($/bbl).   Negative value means a backwardated market.
 
 
 Normal Roll No Roll  Fill Gap
 
 
 
 
 
 Will send the same set of runs for 2nd last day later this morning.
