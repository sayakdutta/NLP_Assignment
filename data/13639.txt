 I think the issue is that if they only have one client then they could be considered employees from a 'discrim/coverage' standpoint.  The issue is probably not in the area of insured plans but the qualified plans.  The 410(b) is our adequate coverage test for the pension plan.

 who knows.  I can't imagine that a customer would somehow owe insurance to the provider's employees.  Michelle
 
  
     
 God I hope not!  However, we do include a portion of leased employees in our 410(b) tests for 'insurance'.  I'd like to know who he talked with.  
 
  
     
 Cynthia, do you know anything about this type of requirement?  Michelle

 Michelle, I was presented with some interesting information yesterday
 and I wanted to run it by you . . . I was not told this by an ERISA
 attorney but it was a person who works with Benefits frequently.  The
 person told me that, if a company only had one customer, the company's
 employees had to be included in the control group of the customer for
 discrimination testing purposes on the benefits plans.  It sounded a
 little iffy to me . . . could you verify?  Thanks.
