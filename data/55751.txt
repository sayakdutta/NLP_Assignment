 Vince,
 
 I'm glad you liked it.  My next "Enron" task is to try and develop a better
 understanding of the way you describe the use of BTU swaps to create a
 synthethic multi-fuel plant.  I understand the basic concept but want to
 learn more about the swaps (duration, cost, etc) which will impact a
 company's decision to build a single vs multi-fuel generator.  Do you have
 some example transactions or analyses that I might look over to learn more?
 
 See ya in April (we're going to learn to "rope" calves this year).
 
 Your friend,
 
 John
