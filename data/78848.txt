 Tom, would it be all right with you if I left early tomorrow?  My husband is leaving early (3:30) for his dentist appointment tomorrow afternoon in Pearland, and it would just make things easier for me to go home with him because my sister-in-law is having her baby tomorrow as well (she's being induced).  I figure I can swing by and pick up the kids while my husband is at the dentist, then pick up my husband, then be on our way to the hospital to see our new niece/cousin.  
 
 Yeah, I know it's complicated and probably more detailed than you needed to know.  I just wasn't sure how to tell you why I'd like to leave early tomorrow!
