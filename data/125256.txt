 Walt is saying the field would just tap the line and install a block valve. Can you talk to Sammie Williams and make sure that you both agree regarding the EFM.
 
 Thanks,

 Paul we the 12" Lips/Mocane TW line in this section and it averages 600# of pressure.  This is the only line we have in this area.  We would install the side valve and the rest we would let EOG furnish [EFM other equipment etc..]  If you need more information let us know.
 Rick Brown can give you a cost estimate 806-342-2044 and Sammy Williams can inform you on the EFM question 806-669-3391  Ext 10.
 Have a good weekend!

 Walt,
 
 EOG currently has three producing wells in Lipscomb Co., BLK 43, Sections 186 and 255. According to EOG, they are flowing ~2300 MCFD into our 12" line through Duke's interconnect in Section 186. EOG has recently completed a well in Section 253 (possibly 2000-5000 MCFD) and has plans to drill at least one more well. They are considering having their own tap into our line, probably in Section 255.  
 
 I am interested in knowing whether or not there are any other pipelines nearby that they could use to sell their gas. 
 
 Also, I spoke with Perry Frazier and I am thinking we would do the tap, install a valve and EFM. EOG would install the rest of the equipment. What are you thoughts?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Paul
