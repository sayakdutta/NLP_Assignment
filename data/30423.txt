Although, if we mess up one, we can always use the other one.  The Lay Reviews are supposed to be over at 5:00, so any time after that.  I don't really have a preference on the return flight. 
 
 Love you
 
  
     
 Do you have a preference as to which hotel we stay in? I checked the Bellagio and they are very proud of their hotel that week ($380/night). The Venetian is kind of steep too but about $100/night cheaper. Other choices that I think would be nice would be the MGM Grand or the Mirage. Just let me know what you want. Also, I need to probably book the flights so let me know what time you want to leave and come back. Thanks. Love you babe.
