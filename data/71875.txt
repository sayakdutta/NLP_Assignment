 a wagon big enough for Bronco!

 No problem. Have fun. Hopefully Michael and I will be working on his covered
 wagon...why am I not surprised about Bronco...maybe we can figure a way to
 work him into the wagon...NM

 Hi there,
 
 I'm thinking of working out after work - hopefully kind of early.  Ok with
 you?  I should still be home before 730.
 
 Michael took Bronco to school.  I'm sure he will have him at the CC.
