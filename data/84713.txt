 waited at Kenneally's until 2:00 am.

 I agree, I propose and intervention tonight afterwork, say, 6 o'clock, at
 Kenneally's?

 I think we need to do an intervention w/ Gerald; he went to Sam's Boat Last
 night w/ his brother.  Well we need to at least get our SCUBA stuff out of his
 car before he sells it for cocktail money.
 
 OUT!
