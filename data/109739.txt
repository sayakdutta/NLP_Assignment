 
 Stephane, I'll be sending to you today checks totaling $22,063.73, which 
 represents 53% of the $41,386.23 total pledges.  I'll be contacting people 
 today to collect outstanding pledges and will send a "care package" to you 
 daily with what I collect.  SRS
 
 
    
  
 If you haven't already done so, please turn in your MS150 pledges TODAY to 
 either Stephanie Strong (EB2365c)
 Becky Pham (EB2336b)
 or Amelia Alder (3Ac3120).
 
 Thanks.
