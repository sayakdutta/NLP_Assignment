 
 We saw a larger credit spread in the market between EOL and ICE.  EOL Socal cash was trading .08 higher than ICE Socal - We ended up short and the market made it very difficult to buy.  EOL SJ cash traded .10 to .20 cents lower than ICE.  The only point without a credit spread was Opal.
 
 Liquidity picked up slightly from Thursday and Friday, but still slow.
 
 No new counterparty issues.
