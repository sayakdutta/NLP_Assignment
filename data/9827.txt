 boyfriend and I were in the middle of a really heavy discussion when you
 called.  He was standing right by me, (upset with me), so it was a little
 awkward.  It was great to hear from you and I'd still like to meet you for a
 drink sometime after work.  Take care, Holly
 
 [Benson, Robert]  Hey Holly, sorry it has taken me so long to get back to you, I went back to Calgary for 10 days. Finally toke a vacation, I'm glad you wrote back, I shouldn't have called on a Friday night. I hope every thing worked out with your boyfriend. I'd love to get out with you, how's next wed or thurs ? Talk to ya later, Rob
