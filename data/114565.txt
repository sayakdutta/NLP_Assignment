 guys can go ahead and confirm these deals. I'm looking into why Puget sales 
 seem to be coming up "no confirm." Thanks for checking, though.

 Hi Kate,
 
 There were several deals that were marked not to be confirmed that appeared 
 to be normal west deals that we should confirm. We've already changed them to 
 yes, but please check with Sean Crandell to see if he marked them not to be 
 confirmed for a reason.
