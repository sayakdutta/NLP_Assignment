 
 June 12 works well for me.  It is likely that we will be on vacation on Friday, June 22.  My husband is finalizing airline reservations today, and to use our frequent flyer miles it looks as if we will have to fly on Friday, June 22 rather than Saturday, June 23.  --Sally

 Please respond with your availability for an all-day offsite meeting on media preparedness with Greg Piper and Vance Meyer.  The dates we are considering are June 12 and June 22.  If neither of these two dates initially don't work for you, please look at your schedule and consider whether you could possibly rearrange any of your appointments.
 
 Many thanks,
