 
 Hello Mr. Uutella,
 
 Thanks for sending me the report. I have read it and I am in the process of preparing a summary of it. I  have a couple of questions for you though.
 
 First, can you explain a little bit about the TAD technology, like how it is done and so on. Also what does TAD stand for?
 
 Second, what does AfH stand for?
 
 Third, the consumption numbers for all the continents were given for year 1999. Do you have them for 2000 yet?
 
 thanks for your help,
 best regards

 Hi Ms. Causholli,
 
 I have made recently a major multiclient study "Outlook for World Tissue 
 Business" which includes all tissue mills with capacities worldwide plus 
 capacity profiles by the largest producers worldwide and by region. I attach the 
 study proposal with this e-mail. The report costs US$ 3,500 (300 pages with 
 detailed Annexes).
 
 If you would like to have only capacity data for the regions you mentioned plus 
 the top 10-12 global producers, I could sell this part of information at US$ 
 600. You should specify the form in which I should present it so that I 
 could easier fulfil your data needs.
 
 
 Best regards
