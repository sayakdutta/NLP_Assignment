 
 Hey Corey,
 
 I'm thinking about driving to Austin this weekend to see Kathy & Travis's new house as well as the two of them and the kids.  Just wanted to see what you were going to be up to and if you might want to get together.  I know you still have to work at the Law Review, but I figure you won't be there 24 hrs. a day...course I could be wrong.
 
 Talk to you soon,
 Sue
