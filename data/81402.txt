 After talking with my father regarding new members for our weather team he sent me the email below.  Sorry there isn't a better lead, however, I did notice that each of these websites have a place to post job opportunities.  Should we be posting something?  Just a thought.
  
 Regards,

 Hi:
 I hope this e-mail finds you both in good health and good spirits.
 Jon was seeking some information on possible sources for Meteorological employment. I spoke to Jim Renick who is the General Manager of our Alberta program and he has e-mailed this information. He also indicated the university of Texas A&M, was a possible locale to find some graduates, and or students, depending on what level of experience you were seeking. 
 If you need anything else, let me know.
 Best regards
 Dad

 Hi Don,
 Here are the webb site address for the American Meteorological Society (AMS) and the Canadian Meteorologica & Oceanographic Society (CMOS) pages.  Both of these orgainizations posts job adds for meteorologists.  The contacts will be in the webb sites.
  
     www.ametsoc.org/AMS <http://www.ametsoc.org/AMS>                www.cmos.ca <http://www.cmos.ca>
  
 There is an AMS conference on weather analysis and forecasting being held in San Antonio, TX in July if that offers any better prospects.  The details will be on the AMS webb page.
  
 Regards,
             Jim
