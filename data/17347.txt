 legislation that prohibits direct access, at least during the time that 
 Legislature and the direct access coalition work together to try to come up 
 with a compromise to continue to allow direct access.  So all this means is 
 that the prohibition still has not been implemented and there currently is 
 nothing before the commission to implement.  Sure would have been nice if the 
 commission had passed it, though.
 
 Also, did I tell you that i'm in a meeting all day tomorrow in houston and 
 therefore can't do an update call with edward's?  i can, however, do it on 
 monday.

 Does this mean that the Commission has, de facto, prohibited direct access?  
 If so, when is it effective?

   Commission Action on Direct Access
 
 The Commission just voted out one half of the "Bilas Alternate."
 
 The decision that got voted out included Bilas' DWR-based language stating 
 that the PUC 1) would not second-guess DWR purchases and 2) would pass 
 through DWR costs to customers.
 However, in a move led by Commissioner Carl Wood, the decision removed the 
 Bilas language on Direct Access.  The decision therefore did NOT include the 
 Bilas language staying any Commission action on implementing the Direct 
 Access prohibition.  Carl Wood called including Direct Access "the height of 
 arrogance."  
 The decision was voted out 3-2, with the 2 remaining Republicans dissenting.
 That said, the Commission has no proposal before it implementing the 
 prohibition, and there was no talk at the meeting of implementing the 
 prohibition any time soon.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
