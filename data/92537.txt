 
 Dawn,
 
 Doesn't it suck to be at work and know that someone else is out of the 
 country?  I just want to let you know how much I suffered while you were 
 gone.  I realize now just how bad you must want out of this group.  Without 
 you or Jennifer there was no real conversation the whole week!!  Chris just 
 works quietly.  Jason interrupts the quiet with inane comments that I have no 
 idea how to respond to.  And Anne...well I can't even explain that.  
 
 Let me digress for just a moment to talk about work.  Nothing really 
 happened.  All was quiet.   If anyone was upset about anything they didn't 
 tell me about it.   I did get an email from Frank Cernseck(or how ever you 
 spell his name).  It seems we took too much as broker fees in July.  I 
 haven't researched it, but from what Victor tells me that's an adjustment 
 that needs to be made on last day P&L.  I'm sure I'm not telling you anything 
 you don't know.   
 
 Just wanted to let you know I'm glad you're here and I'm not.  
 
 Hope you enjoyed your trip.
 
 Robin
