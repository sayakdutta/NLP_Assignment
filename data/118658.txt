 probably draft around it on a case by case basis.  It strikes me that while 
 we might be able to come up with a legal framework that would allow for this, 
 the credit considerations are more problematic.  I would guess that the back 
 office will also be unhappy about having to manually rearrange all of the 
 trades.  This really seems like it is similar to the Aquilla problem in some 
 respects.  When we suggested allowing one entity to trade for another, Credit 
 was quite concerned because the system wouldn't be able to check the 
 appropriate headroom.  I suppose Credit could just assign the lowest headroom 
 for any of the eligible entities to the entire relationship - would  that be 
 acceptable to everyone?  Another possibility is for the fund to set up a 
 master trading entity which does the trades with us and then does back to 
 back deals with whichever entities need the allocations.  That would let them 
 do a large transaction on EOL and then smaller transactions with the other 
 entities.  Of course, the master trading entity would need to qualify for 
 credit on its own somehow.  Guarantees from anyone other than the owner would 
 be difficult (upstream guarantee problems).
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
    
 We have been talking to some of the hedge funds concerning EOL.  They want 
 the ability to allocate transactions between legal entities.  They do not 
 want to have different ID's and make seperate transaction for each entity 
 (during which time the price could move) in order to self allocate.  Do you 
 have any ideas on how we can facilitate this?
