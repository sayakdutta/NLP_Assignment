 I just love Lisa.  I think she's a ton of fun.
 
 
    
  
 I will just put you out all day as jury duty.  I haven't been called in a few

 We had an assistants staff meeting today at lunch.  Lisa Mellencamp will be 
 doing the law conference in October, and I will be helping.  You know we will 
 have a good time!

 Duty is actually in the afternoon, but I think I will spend the morning 
 getting mentally prepared at home.
