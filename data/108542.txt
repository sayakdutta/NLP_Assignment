 Dear Mr. Shankman,
 
 At the suggestion of my colleagues Michael Baker & Donna Armand, I am
 just dropping you this email to introduce myself -- the Penn development
 officer who covers the world!  I am not sure I can benefit you --
 although particularly in Asia I do know an awful lot of people --
 perhaps as much as you can benefit me -- for the same reason.
 
 And there may be some Penn initiatives around the world -- such as
 the Center for the Advanced Study of India, about which you do know --
 that you might like to be aware of -- a major new collaboration in
 the making in the Life Sciences with Singapore, for instance....
 you never know when the network will help.
 
 I'd certainly welcome knowing more about what you do as well.  Totally
 by coincidence I am coming to Houston Sunday to see an alumna who is in
 poor health.  I am sorry that it is over Yom Kippur -- otherwise, I
 would have offered you a meal.  Perhaps we can do it another time,
 Philadelphia, Houston, or Hong Kong!
 
 Thanks for all you do for Penn.
 
 Ed Resovsky.
