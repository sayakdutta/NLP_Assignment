 Sara:
 
 When I saw you here (Sao Paulo) last -at the meeting with the Origination 
 group, you mentioned you could provide assistance on the trading side. I am 
 working on a deal which involves a tolling arrangement  between a marketing 
 company and a power plant.  I would like to take a look at a similar 
 agreement in the US if we have one to use as a guide.
 
 - the deal is called Puerto Suarez -a 150 MW Power Plant we are developing in 
 Bolivia.  The Plant will eventually be sold off to investors, but we will 
 keep the contract for gas and power.  I am working on the Capacity Purchase 
 Agreement which will be a tolling arrangement with the plant for capacity.  
 We have been working with Gabbie in Argentina for the GSA.  I am in SP if you 
 would like to discuss.  55-11-5503-1281  Thanks.
 
 Regards,
 David
