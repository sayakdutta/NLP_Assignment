 Your schedules are very full so I went ahead and spoke to Mark F. about the 
 drift budget for 2001 and my thoughts of keeping drift as a consolidated 
 number (including Europe).  He agreed it would be easier for me to manage it 
 in a single unit  and will get together with you and Dave D. for agreement.  
 I suggested that he and all his managers get together with me if additional 
 explanations are needed.
 
 Hope this is satisfactory.
