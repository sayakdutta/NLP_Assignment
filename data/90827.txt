 Checked on CA flights- I know you are busy so just respond when you can and i will take care of this - it needs to be ticketed today
 Which option works best for you: LAX was too expensive
 
 1- Leave 8/31 at 5:30pm arrive Orange County 6:55pm
 Returns 9/3 leaves there 2pm arrives here 7:20pm 
 Total price $331.50 per person
 
 OR
 2- Leave 8/31 at 8:40pm arrive Orange County 9:55pm
 Returns 9/3 leaves there 2pm arrives here 7:20pm
 Total Price $243.50 per person
 
 PS
 No need to use up miles for this since tickets are not very pricey- would rather
 save those 80k miles to go to a more expensive destination
