 Do you mean we are now approved to use the North American forms of the 
 Electronic Trading Agreement and the Password Application for companies 
 located in Bermuda? Yes
 
 Does this approval apply to financial products only?  At this time, yes.
 
 Are there any other restrictions?  No.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Dave

 Bermuda has been approved as a jurisdiction for all financial products using
