 Michelle -- I doubt that you would have documents of the type described in 
 the memo, but given that the Enron Corp. officer signing the filing has 
 personal liability for failure to identify the documents requested by the 
 form, we need to poll all those involved in the transaction.  To save you 
 time, why don't you call me, and I will give you the two minute synopsis of 
 the memo, so that you can confirm that you know of no responsive documents.  
 x35285.

 Lou, based on our earlier conversation, I have not taken time to review 
 this.  Let me know if I should review it.  Thanks. Michelle

 I previously sent to you Ann Ballard's memo re the HSR filing, and to date, 
 no one has responded.  Prior to making this filing which is a prerequisite 
 for closing, we need to hear back either way----please confirm this directly 
 to Ann at 713.853.5285.
