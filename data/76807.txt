 
 Karen Jones (in Portland) and Sheila Tweed have been working on just the same 
 thing, so I'm forwarding your request to them.

 Next week, Herman and I will be working on a generic 97-10 compliant EPC 
 contract.
 
 Could you forward electronic versions of 1) basic fixed price EPC contract 
 and 2) basic Cost Plus EPC contract.
 
 Call me if you have any questions.
 
 Thanks.
