 
 Does this reflect what was in the TW Commercial 2002 Capital Budget that we reviewed with Stan?

 Palu,
 
 Two major items affected the cashflow since August:
 1.)  Air permits have been delayed from August, 2001 to November, 2001.  The delay of the air permits impacts construction start dates and delays shipment of material.  Major payments of material, equipment and construction have slipped into 2002 because of the air permit delays.  
 2.)  Our compressor vendor has had a few problems.  Their payments are tied to progress.  Our current forecast represents their current payment schedule, which has slipped  as their fabrication has been delayed.
 
 Thanks,
 Steve Kalmus

 Steve,
 
 The last forecast you sent the 2001 Red Rock cash flow was $40.7 million, the current forecast is $23.4 million. Please explain the difference of $ 17.3 million. This affects the TW Maketing Capital Plan for 2002.
