 
 John,
 
 I appreciated your help.  I'm glad we got to do a real deal, even if it was a 
 strange one.  More to come!
 
 I'll check on the sitter, but dinner on the 2nd sounds great.

 Kay-thanks again for the opportunity to work with ENA on the InterGEn deal-I
 hope you were satisfied with us.
 
 Could you and Neil come to our house for dinner on Feb. 2?
