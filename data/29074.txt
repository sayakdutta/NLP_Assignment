 into filing).  We aren't a shipper but we do get happy customers and maybe 
 even more throughput from the deal, so we clearly have a legitimate interest 
 in expedited treatment.   DF
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
   
  
 I'd suggest that Southwest Gas make the filing to expedite vs TW,  it always 
 seems strange to me when someone other than the applicant files unless the 
 party is an actual shipper which we are not--  thoughts???   MK
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
   
  
 As you know, we are still waiting for FERC to issue the necessary certificate 
 authority for the Southwest Gas/TW interconnect.  Ideally, the interconnect 
 facilities would be approved so that they could be constructed by the Gallup 
 in-service date.  Two of our Gallup shippers, Sempra and Reliant, have 
 provisions in their Gallup contracts giving them the option to change their 
 primary delivery point to the proposed Southwest Gas interconnect.  The TW 
 commercial group approached me about a motion to expedite based on this 
 contractual right.  (Keith, I know we've spoken about this before with 
 Lorraine).  Lorraine called her business contact at Reliant, and Reliant's 
 regulatory counsel in D.C. called me today to get more information.  He 
 sounded very positive about filing a motion to expedite a decision in this 
 proceeding and I sent him the relevant background information to get him 
 started.  Getting Sempra to consider filing a similar motion might be more 
 difficult, but Jeff Fawcett is going to work on his business contact there.   
 
 I am going to put together and circulate a motion or letter to FERC from TW, 
 stating that TW's ability to provide service to its shippers will be affected 
 unless certificate authority is granted soon.  Any comments in the meantime 
 -- let me know.
