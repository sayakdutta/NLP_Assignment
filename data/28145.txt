 soviet system your network narcs have rigged up.  We ought to get a copy of 
 it--it would keep Enerson and I from wasting 20 hours a week dealing with 
 amusing videos.  Anyway, the vid you have been denied access to is not as 
 interesting as you probably hoped--its the cartoon game of the guys sitting 
 around at a meeting at which you can make them do things by clicking on 
 icons--like click the cell phone and one guy calls the other one and yells 
 "Whaaaassssupppp!"  Its actually pretty amusing, unless you work at a third 
 reich law firm (actually some guy at some other third reich law firm sent it 
 to me, come to think of it!  I'll stick to emails with a "business purpose" 
 so that I don't inadvertently interfere with "firm related business" (like 
 name changes, etc.).  AMFDJF  
 
 
 
 

   
  
 
 What nastiness are you trying to send me?
