 
 Greetings Sally:
 My name is Jeff Dasovich.  The Greens have been helping me develop 40 acres 
 of land that I bought just north of Anchor Bay (a couple of miles up the hill 
 from Highway One, about 1200 ft or so up) and they suggested that I contact 
 you.
 
 The property is right in the heart of the Banana Belt and my property faces 
 south, is protected, and a such is very hot and sunny from late spring 
 through later summer/early fall.  The property has an abundance of water on 
 it.  Of course, the possibility of evening fog raises some tricky issues, and 
 I haven't done soil tests.  In short, while I think there are some 
 challenges, I'm convinced that there is at least the strong possibility that 
 I could grow grapes--around 10 acres or so.
 
 I'm sure that you're extremely busy, but I'd be very interested in talking to 
 you at your convenience to discuss the viability of growing grapes on my 
 property.  I look forward to talking further about the possibilities.
 
 All the best,
 Jeff
