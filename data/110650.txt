 It's on the website under the power tab.  The link is already created and ready to go!

 i haven't created it yet.  I was hoping to have the link there, so that I can put the file in the directory tomorrow morning (before you get in).  It will be called "curtailments.xls".

 Amanda,
 
 Please add add a link called "Plant Outages (portland)", to the Gas Fundamentals website under the Power tab.  The description is as follows:
 
 "Query of Portland's database of plant outages for yesterday and today."
 
 Thanks.
 
 Mat
