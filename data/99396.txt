 We did not learn of this tentative until after 4:30 today, although it was
 probably posted sometime earlier in the afternoon.  The local rule states
 that a party who wishes to argue the tentative shall notify opposing counsel
 before 4:30. We called their attorneys after 4:30, but before 5 PM. I
 reached Martin Goyette, counsel for the AG personally by phone shortly after
 five, and notified him of our intention to argue. He claimed the AG would
 not appear to argue given late notice. I have notified him by fax of our
 intention to argue.
