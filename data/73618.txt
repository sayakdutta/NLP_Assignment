 other things as well, but that's how I know him.  I can send it to Lloyd if 
 you want.

 Kay,
 
 A&K did the title committment work and is now working on the Property 
 Association Documents (as is Greenberg Traurig in West Palm Beach).  Ann 
 Elizabeth's
 last email message to me before she went on vacation was that A&K was the 
 designated hitter for the Midway Project.    You have been copied on those 
 docs which we desparately need to get to Cooney Midway Groves, the property 
 owner.  As far as I know, they have not been involved in anything else 
 related to Midway this year.
 
 Christi left me a message saying that Lloyd Will or one of his guys needs to 
 review the Interconnction Agreement. I do not know Lloyd.

 PS we had a good meeting with DERM on the landfill closure issues in the 
 Certosa Holdings deal.   I'll try to reach you this afternoon to discuss.  
 
 
  
  
     
 How much involvement has A & K had on Midway?  I have other counsel engaged 
 for the sale, but this falls into a different category.

 Kay:
 
 Greg has Christi's comments on the FPL Construction & Connection Agreement, 
 and he will be sending us those comments today in a marked document. Have we 
 engaged outside counsel to review this agreement? I'd like to have a 
 commercial / legal review fully completed, and then get accounting / finance 
 to comment. I this something you were planning to have Carlos to work on 
 given his recent work on ComEd and Ameren?
 
 Please let me know. Thanks.
 
 Attached is the original generic form of FPL Connection and Construction 
 Agreement for your reference.
