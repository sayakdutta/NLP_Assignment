 
 I have some questions regarding Jennifer's e-mail attached below.  
 
 Is this interruptible?
 Is this a CES contract?

 Here is the information regarding the John Singer deal we talked about.
 
 Buyer - ENA
 Seller - Questa Petroleum Company 
 
 1,588 MMBtu per day at Columbia Gas Transmission Corp. for October 01, 2000 
 through October 31, 2000.
 Price is equal to US Dollars $3.15710 per MMBtu.
 Interruptible Gas
 Contract - Master Purch Wellhead
 
 This deal was originally confirmed as an Oct-Dec delivery of firm gas....on a 
 GTC-Firm...so revised language might want to be included in your confirm(??)
 
 Also, there are only two active trades with Oasis Pipeline Company which are 
 October Transportation deals...and I don't confirm.
 
 Please let me know if you need anything else.
 Thanks
