 Jim/Rob -
 
 As Paul Kraske suggested in this e-mail today, I'm going to get Bill Lawler
 from V&E involved in the India judicial probe analysis.  As you will
 recall, Bill has helped us with the China problems and issues that came up
 in India earlier this year (particularly charitable contributions) and more
 recently with the criminal charges against Sanjeev relating to certain
 quarry leases.
 
 Let me know if you have any comments or objections to our involving Bill on
 this issue.
 
 Thanks,
 Bruce
