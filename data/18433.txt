 Team,
 Let's shoot for Tuesday, May 15, at 2:00 p.m. CDT, 12: 00 noon, PDT.  Mark, 
 we'll call you.  Jeff, I don't know if you're available, but if you've got a 
 spare minute, it'd probably be a good idea for us to rally by phone before 
 the Hearing.  Glen, I'll call you also.
 
 Kim, Steve, if you guys want to sit-in, we'll make the call from one of the 
 offices. 
 
  
 
  

    
 Jeff, I am available Tuesday 12 noon to 1:30 pm or first thing Wednesday
 morning or almost all afternoon Wednesday. Monday , I am traveling. Mark,
 IGS    Have a great weekend.
