 
 So, if I have made payment under this plan will these new CD's I've ordered be free even though they have initially been accessed a charge?  Can you just check my account to see how this new order will effect it.  Is there any way you can provide me with a phone number to speak to someone?  
 
 Thanks
 Paul
