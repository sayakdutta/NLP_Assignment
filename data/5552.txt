 
 as we talked about yesterday, i am still at enron.  while i have a job, i am trading natural gas futures and other derivative instruments.  i am living off of newcastle and 59 in the Gables Pin Oak.  it is very nice - especially since i don't have a roommate any more.  
 glad to hear that the family is doing well
 what are you doing at your new job?  accounting?
 what about the firls - what are they doing?
 
  
     
 no, no more motorcycles.  i'm working for an engineering consulting firm
 near the galleria, and i really enjoy it.  i've been here several months,
 and it seems to fly by.  my lease was up at the gables at the end of
 october, so i have been looking for a townhouse for the last couple of
 months.  i've found several i like, but none i'm extremely crazy about.  for
 thanksgiving, i went and delivered food for meals on wheels with Oma, and
 then ate with my family.  it was really nice.  the girls are so grown up
 now!  mom and dad are getting along better than ever!  i got some of my
 christmas shopping done over the weekend as well.  other than that, not too
 much else going on in my life. for once in my life, i feel as though i don't
 have much stress.  it is actually a wonderful feeling!  what about you?
 where are you living, etc?
