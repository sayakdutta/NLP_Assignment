 
 The deal number in Sitara was changed because of an internal book name 
 change.  It had nothing to do with the monetization status of the deal.  If 
 this has caused a problem, let me know.  I didn't think that just changing 
 the deal number would have this effect.   Thanks.

 Darron, 
 
 Sitara indicates that the below deal #10129 was changed to deal #312218.  
 Steve Ross with Company 103 and my records indicate that this deal should 
 have been monetized until September prod.  Please let me know if you show 
 otherwise, as monetized volume stopped flowing as of July production.  
 
 Thank you, Melissa
 
 
    
 Melissa,
 We are missing the CIG/NNG pull for deal 10129.  The 232,500 is south TX deal 
 10132 which is booked.  Past history
 has the 10129 deal pulling the same quantity as the 10132.   I am just trying 
 to figure out were the other half of the monthly pull might be if in fact
 there is any.  
 
 Thanks

 Steve, 
 
 Please field all monetized questions/requests through me.  We have many new 
 faces, most of which have not yet been trained on monetizations.  We are 
 actually restructuring which coordinators will be handling the monetized 
 contracts and once completed, we will have firm contacts for you. 
 
 To answer your question, Wisconsin Electric Power deal #10132 and 10129 are 
 still valid until 9/00, but I booked invoice #13470SA on your books in Doc 
 #1600000445 for 232500 mmbtu and $1,011,549.39.  Is this not what you were 
 looking for?  Please explain further.
 
 Thanks!  Melissa
 
 
    
 Is the CIG/NNG DUMAS contract expired?  My water fall is still looking for 
 monthly MMBtu and there is none for July production
 yielding  the above short fall.  Please let me know today as I am procesiing 
 this months' payment.
 
 Thanks
