 thinking about Dynegy's "funny money" argument and I volunteer Maria to work 
 with you and Leslie on making sure ENA's comments are consistent with ours on 
 this and all related issues.  DF

 FYI - Attached are ENA's preliminary thoughts on comments for the marketing 
 affiliate conference.  They are not certain yet whether they want to sponsor 
 a participant at the discussion table.
