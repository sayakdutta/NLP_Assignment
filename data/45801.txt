 Credit.

 Dear Tana,
 
 Re Japanese counterparties generally, we are preparing a list of documents to 
 be submitted at time of application for passwords, as well as a check box for 
 use by EOL staff in considering applications to deal with the various general 
 legal issues which have been raised.  (The idea is that anything which falls 
 out of the boxes comes to me for separate consideration but we trying to do 
 it to minimize this need.) 
 
 Re Japanese counterparties which want to do weather, the safest approach for 
 a would-be counter party which is not a bank, securities company or insurance 
 company (or at least does not have these words in its name) is for the 
 application to come back to me in Tokyo for consideration in the context of 
 the laws which prohibit gambling and what we can do to protect ourselves.  
 
 Thanks.

 Per our conversation while you were here, attached is a list of all the 
 Japanese counterparties that have requested Password Applications from 
 EnronOnline.  Let me know you thoughts about this, and, as we discussed, 
 online due diligence with respect to Japanese counterparties.
