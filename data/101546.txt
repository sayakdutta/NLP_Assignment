 Per our conversation, I have put the following information together for you to distribute to individuals in EPMI.  This details out verious aspects of the Texas retail market.  I have included in Item 3 below a copy of a Texas market analysis I prepared for EES which provides detailed implementation requirements.  The following are high-level items that I see need to be completed for EPMI to enter the Texas Retail market by January 1, 2002.  
 	1)  Complete ERCOT LSE application
 	2)  Review market requirements
 	3)  Compare market requirements (enrollments, billing, payments, etc.) with current 	system capabilities for gaps
 	4)  Develop EDI maps based on Version 1.4
 	5)  Register for and complete Flight 1001 Testing
 	6)  Execute applicable TDSP agreements (copies attached)
 		Delivery Service Agreement
 		Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) Authorization
 		Electronic Data Exchange Trading Partner Agreement
