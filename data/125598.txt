 Either Monday or Tuesday works for me. Sure on the bond guy. His name is Bob Warner. He is with Commerce Capital Markets, the broker sub of Commerce Bank, a big New Jersey Regional. His number is (732) 505-2919.  He is located in Toms River NJ. I will call him if you would like and tell him you are coming his way.
  
 Let me know,
 Andy
