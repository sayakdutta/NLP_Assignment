 All,
 
 I think I actually was the one who proposed it in a 1998 "RAP" case three years ago.  The case is long closed and our suggestion was not accepted.  Therefore, we don't have to worry about it. If we like the idea, we would have to find a way to propose it anew -- if we don't like the idea, we just fail to bring it up again.
 
  
     
 We did recommend using the DJ index.  But subsequent to that, I believe we filed as part of the "ARM" coalition, recommending a bottom's-up approach.  Is that right Sue?  However, I don't think it's accurate to say that we "withdrew" the DJ index recommendation.  Both our original DJ recommendation, and the bottom's up recommendation, are still sitting at the PUC.  I think that's how things currently stand.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Steve --
 
 We did originally file that the replacement for the PX Credit should be the DJ Index.  My recollection is that we did withdraw this argument, however I've include Sue Mara on this to double check.  If we haven't, I'd guess that is no longer URM's position?

 I spoke with Mary Lynne today, and she said that once upon a time (after the PX expired) we filed something asking the CPUC to make the DJ index a substitute for the PX credit.  Does this ring a bell?  And the more important question -- did we ever withdraw that request?  Thanks.
