 to get a picture of myself onto the computer, I promise to send it over. In 
 the meatime, just picture me as a Cindy Crawford type, only thinner. :-)
 
 And on the subject of the BPA deal - I just spoke with Val Sabo, who's 
 working with Greg Wolfe and Tim Belden to get this deal done. Apparently it's 
 a good deal; it was put into the system and calculated, then taken out and is 
 currently being re-negotiated. When Greg and Tim come to an agreement with 
 BPA, they will most likely send you a revised confirmation. So in the 
 meantime, Val says to hold off doing anything. We'll keep you posted.
 
 Thanks for checking up on this.

 Just thought it would be a nice idea if you knew who you were talking to in 
 the Houston office.
