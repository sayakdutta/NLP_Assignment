 I forgot to give you an idea of the timing for the request I sent you 
 earlier.  We are shooting to have the models completed this week.  The 
 Alstrom deal was placed on a fast track last week.  If possible, it would be 
 very beneficial to have your input by then.  Let me know your schedule.
 
 Thanks again,
 Mike
