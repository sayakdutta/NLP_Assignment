 1.  The only parties that can trade Argentina physical gas are Argentina 
 counterparties.  They have licensing requirements similar to US physical 
 power.  All existing counterparties that are not Argentinian should be shut 
 down for this product.
 2.  Mark Taylor just found out in a meeting with the tax guys that only ENA 
 can only enter into credit derivates with US counterparties.
