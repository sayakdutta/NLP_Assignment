 Dear Vince,
 
 As the above event is drawing closer, I thought I would write a quick email 
 to finalise a few things with you.  I understand that you would like a guest 
 to attend, please can you let me know their name and job title.  Also, if you 
 could send me your conference checklist I would appreciate it, so that I can 
 finalise details with my audio visual company.
 
 In the meantime, if there is anything I can do for you, please do not 
 hesitate to let me know on 0171-915-5116.
 
 Kind Regards
 Crystal
