 I'm still checking - I had an NC ticket for you but couldn't get ahold of
 you in time.  Give me your work/home numbers again.
 
 Thanks

 Thanks for getting the OU tickets to me on Saturday.  Do you have any
 extras for the Kansas game?  I have Jayhawk relatives coming for the game.
 Let me know.  The D and SP look pretty good.  I hope they are holding
 something back on O.  We'll see.  Thanks.
