 done in Argentina.  Is it possible to handle the bills for work done in 
 Brazil the same way?  I have a bill from Tozzini that we need to pay.  Since 
 it is all in connection with South American trading it seems reasonable to 
 treat it the same as the others but I'm not sure how you are handling these 
 things.  Any thoughts?
