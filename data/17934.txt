 Cameron and Scott - are you still up for playing at Haas on Friday?  Jeff 
 won't do it.  BUt the guy who arranged it sent out an email to everyone 
 saying we were playing and will be really bummed if we don't.  If you guys 
 are still up for it, I can try to find a guitar player to play with 
 us.  Obviously I would ask Steve and see if he could or if he had any other 
 suggestions.  Let me know how y'all feel about it.
