 
 Hope your long weekend was a good one, uneventful on Monday, at least.  Got 
 your message last Friday.  It seems as if Kristin is more and more interested 
 in the EBS role, especially after her continuing discussions with Jim 
 Fallon.  The timing of her trip to London is somewhat up in the air.  May be 
 the end of this week, may be next week.  I think it will still be good for 
 you and Kristin to talk in person.  Kristin and Todd are both very qualified 
 and you would love working with both.  Kristin's established working 
 relationship with Jim Fallon would definitely be a plus.  I don't want to 
 lose both of them from ENA, however, at the same
  time.  So I would suggest that we make it an either or propostion.  
 
 I got your message on housing/location in Houston.  I am headed out of the 
 office soon for an offsite meeting hosted by ENA's Office of the Chairman.  I 
 will call you on Friday when I am back in the office and talk through some 
 options on housing.
