 
 I will not be arriving in BA this week.  Will you be available either Sept. 
 23 or 24?  I will be in Enron's BA office on those two days.  I can meet at 
 your convenience.  
 
 With respect to your comments to our ISDA Schedule, please let me know when 
 to expect your comments.  You previously indicated that I would receive 
 comments by Sept. 10.
 
 Also, could you please fax the article.  It was apparently scanned.  We can 
 only open word documents and we cannot open the article which which was sent 
 and resent on Friday, Sept. 10.
 
 Thanks.  Sara
