 Sara, would you please confirm that the additional changes being requested 
 are consistent with the Enron Corp. Guaranty for the ISDA Swap Agreement?

 Sheila -
 
 Attached are my comments to the Enron Corp. Guaranty.  The form you prepared
 did not include the revisions proposed in the last round of ISDA Guaranty
 negotiations which were agreed to by Sara Shackleton, and I have added them
 in the attached marked draft.
 
 Also, you will note that in our earlier discussions last week North Shore
 Gas contracts were not addressed, and I have attempted to do so here.
 
 We are still looking at the issue of whether specific designation of the New
 York "Commercial Division" for state courts is acceptable, and expect to
 have an answer tomorrow morning.  Also, I have added some additional
 language more typical of an exclusive jurisdiction clause generally.
 
 No one else at Peoples has seen these comments, so they remain subject to
 further change.
 
 Pleae call me if you wish to discuss (312-240-4413).
