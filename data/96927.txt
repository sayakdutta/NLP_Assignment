 All:  Attached below is Enron's attorney's revsion of my draft letter
 agreement, which, in my view, is execution-ready.  This letter has not yet
 been reviewed by EPMI, however, and there may be additional changes from
 them.  Please let me know by cob today if you have concerns or suggested
 revisions; I'd like to get Roy's signature early tomorrow--if Enron has no
 additional comments or revisions to offer.  Thanks.  Larry
