 Attached please find Enron's draft version of the form of "swap agreement" 
 for the Reliable Power Product.  The swap agreement is comprised of two 
 components:  the Reliable Power Product Description and the General Terms and 
 Conditions.  We look forward to receiving the revised draft of the policy and 
 discussing your comments relating to the attached documents.
