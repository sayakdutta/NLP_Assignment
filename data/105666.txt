 
 I think you were going to identify the Lagrasta deals after our meeting of 
 last Tuesday (Oct. 19).  I've done a quick review (although I'm not as 
 familiar with the deals as you may be) and think there are 9 deals:
  
 Aries Resources, LLC
 [Classic Resources Inc.] - dropped
 Formosa Hydrocarbons, Inc. - Breslau also concerned
 Hallwood Energy Corporation
 HS Resources Inc.
 Neumin Production Co. - Breslau also concerned
 Titan Resources L.P.
 TXU Energy Trading Company (?)
 Vastar Resources, Inc.
 
 Could you please verify.  Sara
