 
 Jim,
 
 I really appreciate the offer.  Sorry for the delay in responding - things 
 have been a little crazy.  I would like to accept the tickets for myself.  
 Dutch is on vacation and I have left him a voicemail asking if he's is 
 interested.  I will give you a call a little later in the day when things 
 settle down.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Errol McLaughlin
