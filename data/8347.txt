 
 Enron made most offers to summer interns as a result of campus interviews several months ago.  At that time, I had surveyed my direct reports to determine the number of summer interns that we thought we could effectively accomodate and I provided that number to the recruiting staff.  I understand from Ted Bland that the recruiting team is in the process of assigning summer interns to job opportunities and needs.  You might check with Lexi Elliot (one of the campus recruiters) to see if the number of incoming interns has matched the business needs.  If we have more jobs than interns, then Lexi could help in the process of interviewing Debbie for a position.  My last conversation with Ted Bland led me to believe that we had a sufficient number of incoming interns, but it wouldn't hurt to check with Lexi.  --Sally 
 
  
     
 Hi Sally,
 I just wanted to touch base and see if you know of anyone who has an opening in their dept for a summer student.  Debbie Wang is a third year marketing major and is interested in working at Enron.  She is the daughter of an I/T developer which I mentioned to you previously (Richard Wang).  I would appreciate any thoughts...
 
 Thanks,
 Avril
