 Hi Michelle, 
 I received your voice message about drafting an amendment to the Severance Pay Plan, but I have not received your email describing the design of the amendment. 
 I have already drafted two amendments, a restated plan document and a form of resolution terminating the plan.  I should be able to make something fit the design you are sending me. 
 I have canceled plans for the morning so that I can help with this project, and look forward to working with you to finalize the amendment. 
 Pat
