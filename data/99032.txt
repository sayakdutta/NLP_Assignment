 The House of Lords have notified us that they will give their decision in the 
 CATS litigation on Wednesday 4 April.  The decision is being handed down 
 approximately 6 weeks earlier than anticipated.  Our counsel Jonathan 
 Sumption believes this may be a favourable sign for Enron for two reasons:  
 (1) he believes the Lords would not have had a suffficient amount of time to 
 do the sort of analysis that it would take to compose a decision overturning 
 the Court of Appeal ruling, and (2) he believes that Lord Hoffman, the 
 individual who seemed most against us during the hearing, is busy writing a 
 decision in an important human rights case and very likely then is not 
 writing the decision in our case.  For these reasons, the likelihood of the 
 ruling being in favour of Enron has improved; I would estimate our currently 
 likelihood of success at 60%.  Our team believes that the CATS parties are 
 unlikely to accept a settlement offer of less than o50 million.  Because we 
 believe we are more likely than not to win, we believe we would be giving up 
 value by making an offer of o50 million and therefore recommend that we not 
 make an offer of settlement.  
 
 We expect to have a decision by 11:00 am London time on Wednesday;  judgement 
 will be handed down formally at 2:00 pm that day.  I will make sure that each 
 of you is contacted as soon as possible with the result.
