 Tanya and Mark,
 
 We're starting to talk to some resorts about doing weather deals and I wanted 
 to give you guys a heads up.
 We don't have a structure in place and don't have financials yet; we should 
 be getting them sometime this week. 
 But, we would like to start sending the ISDA documents so that they can get 
 comfortable with them.
 
 Mark: Please send the docs to Dick Deutch,  his number is 314.432.4000. 
 
 Details:
 North Peak Resort
 10920 Schuetz Road
 St. Louis, MO  63146
 
 We're thinking about doing a 1,3 or 5 year deal.  We've already mentioned the 
 letter of credit to them.  
 The deal might be done on the event of temperature hitting below 28-30 
 degrees.  
 Please call me if you have any questions.
 
 Best Regards,
 
 Lucy
