 Kay,
 
 Per Karen Way, October 2 is the effective date of the Agreements.  No 
 Memorandum was prepared (but Karen would be happy to prepare one for us).  I 
 know it is Bart's practice to execute and file Memorandum's for third party 
 notice and I personally think it is a good idea.  If you would like, we could 
 prepare 2 Memorandums from Forms of Memorandums we typically use and send to 
 Karen for approval of the form of Memorandum for use in Illinois and to get 
 signed for us.
 
 Please advise.
 
 Kathleen
 
 
   
  
 Kathleen,
 
 Please call Karen Way at Piper Rudnick and follow up on the points you 
 raised.  October 2 sounds good to me for an effective date, but you might as 
 well check with Karen to see if there is a reason she didn't date it.
 
 Good job.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
   
  
 Kay,
 
 When the Ledford's and Fehr's signed the Option Agreements, they did not date 
 on the signature page however, October 2, 2000 was inserted on page 1 (the 
 Cover Sheet).  Can I insert October 2, 2000 as the effective date on the 
 signatue pages?
 
 Also, Paragraph 15 of the Option Agreements refers to a Memorandum to be 
 executed and recorded in the office of Recorder of Deeds.  Do you know where 
 these documents are?  It may be that outside counsel has them and will record 
 them.  If not, I guess we should follow up?
