 Dear Vince Kaminski,
  I was auditing Prof Dyer's Real Options class on Thursday when you spoke
 on Enron's activities in this area.  I would be interested in exploring the
 possibility of joining the group that works on real options in response to
 and in anticipation of Enron's business requirements.  I'm currently
 working in the development and application of real options methodology at
 Schlumberger.  In particular I'll be speaking at an industry Real Options
 Valuation conference in London (http://www.iqpc.co.uk/finance/rov/) and I
 just had the paper accepted for publication in Operations Research.  Could
 you pass my resume on to the relevant people to have a look at?
 
 Thanks in advance,
 
 Chris Kenyon
