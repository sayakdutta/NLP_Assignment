 place with between ENA and Southern Company Energy Marketing L.P.  I am a 
 little concerned if Canada wants to trade under this pursuant to the Services 
 Agreement.  Being a Local Currency-Single Jurisdiction form, it does not have 
 tax and currency provisions that would enable us to do a cross border trade.  
 If you would like to do trades under this, we might want to consider amending 
 it to add the necessary provisions, adding the provisions into the 
 confirmation, or replacing it with a Multicurrency Agreement.

 Southern Company or Southern Energy North America, Inc. or another trading 
 arm of Southern Company.  The reason I ask is because Southern wants to do 
 some deals with us in Ontario and I wanted to know if we have already 
 negotiated ISDAs with them.  
 
 thanks
