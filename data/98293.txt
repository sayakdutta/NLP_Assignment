 
 I will check with our outside counsel concering whether a new petition has 
 been filed. I am fairly certain there is no new filing. However, the  
 Plaintiff's  discovery is clearly leading to claims or allegations that Kevin 
 McConville, an ECT/ENA officer, through his board position and involvement at 
 NSM Management Co. acted improperly. I wouldn't close your file yet.

 Richard, Bonnie White advises me that you are handling this matter with 
 outside counsel.  As you are aware, the underwriters denied coverage on this 
 matter back in December 1999.  They have now inquired if any Amended 
 Complaint has been filed that names a Director and/or Officer of Enron and if 
 no Enron or an Enron subsidiary securities are involved.  If nothing has 
 changed, they will go on and close their file.  Please advise if there is 
 anything new to report.
