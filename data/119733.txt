 
 Believe it or not, I have booked my trip to London and Paris.  I am coming out there around October 4 with my freind Deb and her freind Christie.  We are staying at Mark Frevert's flat.  Hopefully, we can get together for lunch or dinner during that time.  I'll get back to you in a couple of months wonce I know more about our plans.
