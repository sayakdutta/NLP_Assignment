 John,
 
 What's your view. Should we consider doing something more for Todd? I think Jeff would like to pay him or grant him some more equity. I am on the fence. When I mentioned it to Deliainey a week or two ago he said no then said I should discuss with you.

 With regard to Todd Busby - some clarification.  His total bonus was $75,000 - of which he appears to have decided to take 20% in equity.  The last numbers I heard before bonuses went final were a total bonus of $100K consisting of $75K in cash and $25K in equity.  This $100K bonus was agreed to without the knowledge that his contract called for $150K if he was in the top two groups.
 
 The above is really just to remind you to continue reflecting on whether it would be feasible to do anything for Todd.
 
 Jeff
