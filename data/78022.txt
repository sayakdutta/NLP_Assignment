 Everyone,
 
 When first we did the Demar deal, we received from Intership, the owner of 
 the barge, a letter allowing us to take Demar's position in the contract to 
 complete the purchase of the vessel should Demar fail to complete the 
 purchase.  The reason for this is that Demar was providing its interest in 
 the barge purchase contract as  collateral to the line of credit of $20MM.
 
 What Gregorio Relloso is referring to in his letter is that we could now have 
 a lien on the vessel to collateralize the line of credit.
 
 I believe the savings to Demar in accelerating the payment is $700,000.  
 Since Demar will no longer be making payments on the barge it's cash
 flow should improve in September, October and November at which time I 
 understand the work on EPC-4 should be complete.
 
 For what it is worth I think we ought to approve this transaction providing, 
 a) there is room in the credit line and none of our conditions are affected 
 and b) Demar's projected cash flow to job completion is not negatively 
 impacted.
