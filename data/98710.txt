 Colleen:
 
 Attached is a revised version of the draft you forwarded.  We can discuss 
 next week, but this will not be sent to TDC until the lawsuit is filed.  By 
 copy of this e-mail, I am asking Richard Sanders to take a quick look  at the 
 letter including specifically the next-to-last paragraph.
