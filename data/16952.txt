 
 Don't even worry about it.  Thanks for being sensitive to the issue. Good to 
 see you guys this weekend, despite all the excitement.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 I didn't get this e-mail until today  (I mean I hadn't downloaded anything
 for a couple of days and therefore didn't even know it was there).  If I had
 seen it, I wouldn't have made the comments I made at the dome about wanting
 to hear what you had to say about the very things you specified in your
 e-mail you didn't want to hear.  You must have thought I was deliberately
 going against your wishes and I apologize for that.  If you remember, the
 last time we had talked about the problem re energy, you were not reluctant
 to discuss it so I thought something had happened at the dome that needed to
 be straightened out.  So, as I stated above, if I had seen your e-mail
 before going to the dome, I would have understood what was going on.

 hi.  how's things.  my cars getting fixed as we speak!  it'll be ready next
 tues/wed.  I'm very excited about going to the dome this weekend and
 looking forward to seeing you guys.  can you please bring annie with you?
 
 one small request:  i'm pretty frazzled with work, school, etc. and am
 looking forward to relaxing and hanging out with you guys.  it would be
 great to talk about anything other than 1) the electricity crisis and 2)
 george w. bush.  i figure we can talk for hours about how to get the
 railing done on the deck!
 
 best,
 jeff
