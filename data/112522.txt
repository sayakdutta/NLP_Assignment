 Kerry/Susan, what are your thoughts?  I think it would be a good move as it delays implementation of ARTO which gives the MISO further time to develop its day 2 protocols...the only downside is NG response (Jim could you talk to Ashley as discussed and let him know that we haven't had time to respond adequately on this filing).
 
 regards
 Mike
