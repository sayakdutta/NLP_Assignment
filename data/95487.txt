 *** Springsteen visits Jersey Shore club
 
 ASBURY PARK, N.J. (AP) - A legendary Jersey Shore rock club had a
 special guest at its birthday party over the weekend: Bruce
 Springsteen. The Boss made a surprise appearance Sunday night before
 about 2,500 fans at the Stone Pony in Asbury Park. The show, which
 marked the one-year anniversary of the club's reopening, featured
 another shore favorite, Southside Johnny and Asbury Jukes, and
 rocker Graham Parker. Springsteen showed up on stage at about 8:40
 p.m. and performed with the band and Parker for about an hour. The
 set featured several Springsteen songs and some Southside staples,
 along with a cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival's "Born on the
 Bayou."
