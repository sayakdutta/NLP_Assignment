 
 Keith,
 
 It was a great pleasure to work you with on this project.
 The entire Enron team was impressed by the quality of the students 
 and commitment of the School to exploring new and creative
 ways of exposing students to business problems.

 Vince;
 
 I just wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed working with Enron on the Tiger
 Project.  I found the interaction with you and your colleagues very
 stimulating.  The ideas we covered (like whether there are network
 externalities in these markets) was more like a workshop than a project.  I
 wish all businessmen had your interests and capabilities.
 
 Thanks
 
 Keith
