 This sounds fine.
 
  
     
 I had Frank Ermis talk to Cowan about having an open line on our box to you guys. I also asked Frank to talk with Cowan and Calrk each morning to discuss the market.  We have a wed fundies meeting each week at 3:30.  I would like you guys to call in for this meeting.
 
 Let me know what you think.
