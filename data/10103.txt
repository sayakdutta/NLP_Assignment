 Lynn,
 
 I was ask to make a selection between Amy and Christine to do testing for the  new accounting project. Which will take up to 50% of their time away from the team. My recommendation to you and Rick Dietz was Christine McEvoy to be the selected individual to test on this project. If you have any concerns on this matter please let me know. Thank you. 
 
 One more thing, could we mention this in the next team leader meeting for all the individuals involved in this testing.
