 
 Attached are redlined versions of an amended and restated LLC agreement and 
 an amendment to the Administrative Services Agreement.  I decided to simply 
 amend the Admin. Agreement since the change was so minor.  You will note that 
 the changes in the LLC Agreement were solely to accommodate the revisions 
 made in the Capacity Allocation Agreement which I forwarded earlier.  Please 
 call if you have any questions.
