 Yesterday, Sunday the 24th, one of our gas controllers was stuck in an elevator for approximately 5 hours. Apparently the alarm and the intercom were not functioning and she had no way of notifying anyone that she was stuck between the 39th floor and the plaza. After other dispatchers became concerned about her being missing and searched for her, it was 2 hours before they determined she was stuck in an elevator. It then took another 3 hours to repair the elevator and get her out. We were advised by one of the guards that the weekly test and inspection of the intercoms was not performed on Saturday, as scheduled. Evidentially the level of maintenance and monitoring of the elevators has recently changed.  
 
 We are pursuing this matter with Bill Donovan and the building/security staff.
