 Attached please find the Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release, edited
 pursuant to our discussion this morning.  Only one other change has been
 made; Robin wanted to include the language "or which could have been
 asserted" in paragraphs 6 and 7.  If you need any additional changes or have
 any comments, please do not hesitate to contact me.
