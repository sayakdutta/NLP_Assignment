 
 Bobby, 
 
 Unfortunately, we will not be able to make it Saturday night.  We will be in Dallas visiting my brother and his wife, sort of a late Christmas get together.  I hate that we are going to miss it, but I will touch base with you later.
 

 
 
 Thanks.

 Happy New Year!
  
 Next Saturday, January 12, is our get together  dinner.  Instead of going out to a restaurant, Myra and Rodney Burke  graciously offered the use of their home for a nice catered dinner.  Myra  has a friend who will be preparing a full meal for us, served buffet  style.  We'll meet at 7:00 until 10'ish.  I'm thinking the  dress should be snappy casual (I don't really know what that means, but it  sounds good).  We're going to have an appetizer, salad, herb pork loin  something or other, vegetables, dessert, the whole fancy dinner  thing.  It should be great.
  
 The caterer needs an exact count of how many  will be there, so let me know by next Wednesday, January 9,   (incidently, our first NEON back) that you'll be there.  Brad Cox wants to  treat you to dinner, so all you need to bring is yourself, and if married, your  spouse. 
  
 So call a babysitter, email me back, and lets  get together! 
  
 (I've heard some people may not have gotten the  emails concerning this date and the arrangements--do me a favor and  please make sure your co-leaders know about this).
  
 Bobby
