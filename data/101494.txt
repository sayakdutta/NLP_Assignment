 
 Jesssseka!!!!
 
 I know, it's been ages since we've chatted.  I will definitely give you a buzz so we can catch real time.  
 
 I got Clay's message and thought I'd replied, but obviously I forgot.  I'm actually going out of town next weekend.  Which makes me so sad because it would be great to see everyone again.  Of course, I suppose we'll all be seeing quite a bit of each other with Jen and Caycie's weddings coming up.
 
 I talk to you soon,
 
 Sue
 
 Glad to hear things are good...even if they are hectic.
 
  
     
 
 susie q, how are  you??????
  
 i hope that all is  well.  i have been meaning to call you for ages.  how's houston?   how's work--still great, i hope?  how are boys?  ect, etc,  etc???
  
 clay and i are doing  well.  we are half way through our summer of working and being wined and  dined.  we eat a lot!!!  we are living in my parents' garage  apt--needless to say, the summer has been a little crazy!!
  
 i know clay sent you  an email at the beginning of the summer, but i just wanted to remind you that we  are going to the lake (LBJ) next weekend.  i am sure you are super busy,  but i'd love to see you if you get a chance!!  lisa and brad and jen and  matt are coming and eddie is going to come for a little bit on saturday, i  think!!
  
 i will try to call  asap---
  
 much love,  jessica
