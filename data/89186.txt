 Thanks!
 
  
     
 
 Debra,
 
 Here is your contract with the "red-line" changes as requested by LG&E.  Please respond via e-mail when you receive this document and if you have any problems opening it or if I can do anything in the short term to assist you.  I will be glad to print a hard copy and bring it to your desk if you wish.
 
 Thank you for all the back and forth on this deal!

 Steve: 
 I apologize for the delay in returning this agreement to you. I have attached a red-lined version of Debra's agreement for Enron's review. Once everyone has had a chance to look over this draft , please feel free to contact me if there are any questions.
 I know that everyone is very interested in putting this agreement in place, therefore any assistance you can give in pushing this review along would be greatly appreciated.
 Thank you for your help, 
 Lora

     Lora, 
 We do need you to red-line the actual document sent by Debra.  I've sent 
 the copy to Chris Balmer.

    Per my voice mail today, attached in the below e-mail is a "red-lined" 
    copy of the Gas Firm agreement which was previously sent to Majed 
    Nachawati. 
    If this revised agreement is acceptable to Enron North America, please 
    forward me original documents for execution. 
    LGE/KU is eager to begin spot trading with Enron; therefore any help you 
    can provide in accelerating this process would be greatly appreciated. 
    I also mentioned in my voice mail that I would forward a copy of this 
    revised agreement to Debra Perlingiere. Unfortunately, the 
    e-mail which I received did not contain her e-mail address. Would you 
    please forward this on to her, if that is where it needs to be. 
    Thank you for your assistance with this matter and I look forward to 
    hearing from Enron soon. If I can be of any additional assistance during 
    this process, please contact me as noted below.

    much for your patience.
