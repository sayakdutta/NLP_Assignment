 
 Hi Nancy,
 
 We are still on for Thursday with VEPCO in Richmond.  I would like for you to 
 participate.  In addition, we would like the opportunity to meet with you 
 before hand.  We can meet late Wednesday afternoon in DC.  How does that 
 sound to you?
 
 I look forward to speaking with you soon,
 
 Kay
