 
 I think you sent me an email which had some information from the gang about 
 the tests, etc.  Do you still have it?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay

 Would you please call Mitcha and get the relevant information?  I suppose 
 that a demand letter (under the warranty?) could be in order but any 
 pre-litigation moves need to be coordinated with Richard Sanders.  Maybe this 
 hasn't risen to that level yet, but $12 Million sounds pretty serious.
