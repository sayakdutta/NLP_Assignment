 I have reviewed the Transformer and Turbine Letter Agreements I received 
 today.
 
 Transformer Letter
 
 2(a) & 3(e):  why is there usage of "ABB et al." when ABB is defined?  Also, 
 the "certain agreement" referred to in both sections is NOT between ENA and 
 ABB.  It's now between E-Next Generation LLC as purchaser, ENA as agent for 
 purchaser, and ABB, as amended.
 
 3(a):  have two sets of "(i), (ii)" in para.  It's also unclear what this 
 para actually says.
 
 4:  definition of "Term" should go after (b) no?
 
 
 Turbine Letter
 
 3(a):  Para is clearer than in Transformer but still difficult to understand.
 
 3(f):  Don't understand this para. and what happens with the final payment 
 due to GE.
 
 3(g):  the "certain agreement" is not between GE and ENA.  See first comment 
 under Transformer Letter.  There is also the usage of "et al." after GE.
 
 4:  same comment as in Transformer Letter.
 
 I haven't had a chance to review the LLC Agreement yet.
