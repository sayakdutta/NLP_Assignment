 Attached for your review is Jim Peters' rough draft. Jim tried to design it 
 in such a way as to be as generic as possible, with the idea that factual 
 differences between the parties would be put in the footnotes.  I am 
 concerned he may be overreaching with regard to the legal objection, where he 
 refers to TW/Northern as a "nonresident", given that (as I understand it) 
 Northern and/or TW have facilities in Oklahoma.  There are also some 
 grammatical changes that I would make.
 
 I wonder if I could get ya'll to take a look at this and have you participate 
 with me in a telephone conference with Jim later this afternoon?  If Drew, 
 Jim or Bob could let me know what time would be convenient, I'll get it set 
 up.  Many thanks.
 
        B.K.D.

 Attached to this email is a proposed draft of a Special Appearance and
 Objection for your review and approval.  Please note Footnote 1 needs your
 input.
 
 Hopefully, we can send the pleading out today but in no event later than
 tomorrow.
 
 Regards,
 
 Jim Peters
