 he'll do.  Whitaker will still be TB but we've got a redshirt frosh named 
 Keith Joseph who has the dimensions of Eddie George and played really well on 
 the scout team.  I'll bet he sees a lot of PT at TB if he's really that 
 good.  He was one of the very few guys that RC got over MacIII in the last 
 few years of recruiting.
