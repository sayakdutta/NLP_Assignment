 Memo to Credit Derivatives Documentation Task Force:
 We have arranged for meetings of the Credit Derivatives Documentation Task
 Force to take place simultaneously in New York and London on Monday,
 November 13, at 9:30 NY time/2:30 London time. The New York meeting will
 take place at the offices of Chase Manhattan Bank, 270 Park Avenue, 11th
 Floor, Room C. The London meeting will take place at the offices of Morgan
 Stanley Dean Witter, 20 Cabot Square, Canary Wharf, London E14.  Please RSVP

 be attending.
 At each meeting, I will arrange for several individuals to present their
 view on the Restructuring issue. There will then be an opportunity in each
 meeting to ask questions of those individuals and for more general
 discussion. We will then link the London and New York meetings by telephone
 to share views between the meetings. 
 This distribution list is drawn from participants in the documentation
 process. The Restructuring issue, while focused on a term in the
 documentation, is nevertheless one of market practice and not really one of
 documentation. We, therefore, encourage you to ensure that the views of your
 trading desk are expressed at the meeting, preferably by having someone from
 the desk at the meeting. We expect a large number of people at the meetings,
 however, so we also encourage you to consider who from your institution is
 most critical to be in attendance to ensure that your views are heard. 
 We look forward to hearing from you on the 13th.
