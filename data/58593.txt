 SK - I emailed him and asked him to call me to schedule some time with you 
 next week.  mm
 
 Steve -
 
 I was hoping to grab you for a few minutes in San Antonio to get some "Enron 
 career advice" but wasn't able to find you at a time when both of us were 
 free.  Any chance I could grab 20-30 minutes this week or next?
