 I spoke to Jeff Haggard.   Out of the 10 slots they rotate every 10 seconds, they can give us 7 slots.  This means that our ad will be on the site 70% of the time.  We can't take all 10 ads since they have to appear to be "fair" to other companies.
 
 They are in a pilot phase and only doing this for 3 months for now.  This should be ok since they are willing to modify the  contract to reflect that we have first right of refusal if they extend the program.  We do risk any price increase after 3 months.  But, they are unwilling to offer a longer term than 3 months.  
 
 They have verbally reserved the space for us for today.  Please approve the following cost asap so that I can finalize the contract with them before someone else takes the slots:
 
 3 months x $500/mo x 7 ads = $10,500
 Ad development cost:  Don't know yet (I would guess about $5,000, we can discuss)
 
 Thanks.
 
 Kal
