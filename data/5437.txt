 
 tom brady - bishop was cut a long time ago
 
  
     
 Who is his replacement?  Bishop?
 
  
     
 they think bledaoe will be back in 2-3 three weeks.  no injuries to internal organs ( that is what they were concerned about)
 
  
     
 I like the deal because it give me some instant production, but I'm concerned about Bledsoe's injury.
 
 I'll shoot you an e-mail over lunch.  
  
     
 did you get a chance to look at anything last night?
