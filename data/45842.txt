 
 Neither Enron London nor Enron London/Singapore has an ISDA Master in place 
 with Union Oil Company of California.  ENA does, but that won't help you.

 Hi Tana,
 
 I have left you a voicemail regarding this matter, but I thought I would 
 expand on what I require.
 
 Enron Singapore branch did a trade with Unocal International Trading Company 
 (Singapore) on EOL.
 
 I want to know if the American entity (Union Oil Company California) has a 
 Master Agreement / ISDA Agreement with Enron London / Singapore on a 
 Financial stage.
 
 If they do please could you forward a copy of the agreement, otherwise please 
 could you call me to discuss the matter further.
 
 Thank you for your help.
 
 Ricky
