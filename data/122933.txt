 What ever happened on this?  I thought I Kelli was working on something.  Just let me know.

 Charlie,
 
 Please find attached two files that contain information for gas swap pricing for the following deals:
 
 1.	NICOR
 2.	Anadarko (Carthage)
 
 We have put notes at the bottom of each page to help clarify our request.  A notional price is fine for right now, let me know if you have any questions.  
 
 Thanks for your help,
 
 John
