 
 Very sweet.  Thanks.
 
 Well, I tried.  No taker on the tickets.  Looks like you'll have to give them to your Neanderthal friend.  Or what about Jack and dottie?
 
 
     
 
 
 
 
     
 
 Oh Nancy - I'm am so very sorry.  You know I've been there all too many
 times 
 but the love and companionship they give so eagerly is worth every minute of
 
 the pain.  Annie was such a special dog and Sabrina loved to play with her.
 
 In the long run, Prentice will feel better having been there with her - I 
 know because I've been with a couple of very special friends the same way.  
 Now I have to wipe the tears off my keyboard.  Love, Bobbi Sue
