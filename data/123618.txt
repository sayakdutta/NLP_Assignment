 
 the thing that i will also tell you is that both flight options and travelair 
 will allow you to arrange a demo flight and will only charge you the hourly 
 rate as if you were an owner.  since you are not paying monthly fees or 
 capital, this is a really good deal.  i would suggest doing this with both of 
 them before you decide to buy anything  --  ideally on a long flight with a 
 big plane.
