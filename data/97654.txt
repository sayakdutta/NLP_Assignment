 Kathy, Bob Williams should attend this meeting tomorrow in my absence.
 
 I think the purpose of the meeting is to discuss the UC/CSU contract in the 
 SDG&E service area.  Richard, I think you are included because  EES will be 
 briefing John Lavarato later this week.  Bob, can you bring Richard up to 
 speed on the issues?
