 
 it depends what type you get.  if you get one of those little furry dogs that you can carry with you everywhere, then i can't like that dog.  if you get one with personality like a bulldog it can stay at my place.  those little furry dogs act like cats.
 
  
     
 no!  you are so mean.  why would you ever want to kick a precious little
 puppy?
 
 
     
 
 only if i have a bad day.  if i have a bad day will you let me come over
 and kick it?

    mean
    to it?
