 We should be able to direct employees to the web site <http://home.enron.com> for plan information.

 Michelle & Rick, do we want to answer this question now?
  
     
 
 
  
     
 The answers so far have stated current Enron Corp Severance Plans are in place for those employees laid off.
 
 What are the Enron Corp Severance Plan details? Where can they be found?
 
 Thanks
