 	will know how much we are billing or if we are billing at all.  Hope this helps.  Thanks. Lynn

 Oneok sends Northern helium volumes monthly attached to their Third Party Bushton Allocation Report. Oneok ran a test for November's Production which produced some volume (approximately 1000 mcf per Sherry Rogers /Oneok) to be reflected on their statement for November's production. Market Services will keep you undated each month by e-mail on any actual helium produced at the Bushton Plant.
 
 If you have any questions, please call me at (713) 853-6600.
