 
 We have received the executed Confidentiality Agreement between the 
 referenced Counterparty and ENA dated April 27, 2000.  The copy will be 
 forwarded to Dave Samuels.
 
 It is my intention that Dave Samuels maintain a complete file of all the 
 Confidentiality Agreements for EnronOnline.  If there is some otherr person 
 than Dave who sould maintain the central file repository for EnronOnline 
 Confidentiality Agreements please this let me know.
