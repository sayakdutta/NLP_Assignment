 	to review the invoice to ensure that the adjustment to the price has been made if
 	there is alternate deliveries.  Let's be proactive to ensure we have accurate billing.
 	If you have any questions, please let me know.  
 
  
     
 This adjustment will result in approximately $7800 in additional revenues.  
 
 One way to prevent this situation in the future would be for the rep and or myself to ensure that Duke's rate has been increased when they have alternate deliveries to the border.   If these alternate deliveries exist and the rate has not been increased then the rep needs to bring this situation to the attention of the marketer.
 
  
     
 FYI - In working to load rates for the FERC California reporting requirements, it appears that for the last four months Duke Energy T & M contract #27291 has not been billed the incremental fee of $0.06/dth for alternate deliveries to the Cal Border (over and above the base discount negotiated for the contracted primary points).
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
 
 Thanks,
 Elizabeth
