 
 You should plan on attending the meeting then tomorrow with Kevin.   It's 9-10 in Stan's Office.
 
  
     
 We have done an evaluation that showed our interest to be worth the following:
 
 10%		12.5%		15%
 $84mm		$73mm		$64mm
 
 If you want to see the model let me know.
 
 Cheers.

 They took bids and I think have an offer of about $60 MM or so.
 
 Michael: What do you know about this one?
 
  
     
 yes, what is the deal that sounds reasonable?   
 
  
     
 Can you attend this one for me?     They are working on the sale of our interest in the Trailblazer Pipeline.    Sounds like a reasonable deal to me.
