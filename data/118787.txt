 coming back to join the department.  Hooray!  I was hoping we could chat 
 about how you would feel about joining the financial trading group this time 
 around.  I'm leaving for the airport in just a bit to head out of town for 
 the rest of the week but would be happy to talk when I get back and you 
 should feel free to talk to Carol and Sara in the meantime.
