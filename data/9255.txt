 
 Sheila,
 
 I'm sorry I haven't responded to this before, but Sally has been out of the 
 office with family illness & I haven't been able to check with her.  I will 
 be out of the office until Tuesday, so if you need this information before 
 then, please call Chantelle Villanueva at ext.36279 on Monday and she can 
 check with Sally then.
 
 Thanks,
 Patti
