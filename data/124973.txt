 Kourtney,
 
 Per our conversation, ECTRT should receive congestion revenue for HE 2, HE 23 and HE 24.
 All congestion revenue was across Path 15.  All revenue was at $248.
 Volumes were as follows:
 	HE 2		8 mws
 	HE 23		38 mws
 	HE 24		30 mws
 	HE 24		20 mws
 
 Total volume was 96 mws at $248, revenue should be $23808.
 Please see me with any questions.
 
 Thanks
 Bill
