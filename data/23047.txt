 ___________________________________________________________
 Disregarding some federal cases to the contrary, the Supreme Court of Texas
 has held that the correct standard of causation applicable in all TCHRA
 discrimination cases is the "motivating factor" standard.  Accordingly, the
 Court found that the trial court erred by refusing to give a "motivating
 factor" instruction in this pretext case.  Prior federal court decisions
 addressing Title VII "pretext" cases had required a plaintiff to demonstrate
 that the protected characteristic was a "determining factor" in the decision
 at issue. These federal cases indicated that the "motivating factor"
 standard was applicable only to "mixed motive cases" in which the plaintiff
 had direct evidence of discrimination.
 
 Also troubling for Texas employers is the Court's secondary holding
 regarding the plaintiff's evidence of age discrimination.  The company
 terminated the plaintiff's employment for documented poor performance.
 Because the plaintiff offered anecdotal evidence from co-workers suggesting
 that he was a good performer, the court determined that he had produced
 sufficient evidence of pretext to get to the jury, citing Reeves v.
 Sanderson Plumbing Prods. Inc., 120 S.Ct. 2097 (2000).  As suggested by the
 dissenting judges, this holding could mean that a plaintiff can avoid
 summary judgment in a poor performance case by producing some evidence of
 positive performance feedback
