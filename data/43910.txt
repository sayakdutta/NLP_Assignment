 
 I had a conversation this morning with my contact at APS re: the Sun Devil Project.  Their #1 concern right now on the project is Enron creditworthiness as it regards building this pipeline.  
 
 How do I get them comfortable?
 Is there a timeline for getting a credit agency rating on TW?  If so, when?
 Should we get Rod Hayslett / Stan on the phone with their finance people?
 
 Please advise asap so I can put an action plan together.  Thanks for the help.
