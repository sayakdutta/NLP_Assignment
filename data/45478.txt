 
 Bill Bradford called this morning and wants to put Duetsche Bank on the front 
 burner.  He has been speaking to them and wants to set up a conference call 
 later this week to resolve the remaining issues.  It appears that Carol was 
 working on this master.  Bill wants to know what lawyer will be picking this 
 up, hopefully sometime this morning, so he can set up the conference call.  
 If you let me know who can work on it I'll track down the file for you...
