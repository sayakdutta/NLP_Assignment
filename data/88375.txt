 will be better for both.  We have a lot catch up on.  I think you could give 
 me some much need coaching  in a few areas.  As for the  "J" men,  well I 
 think you have the better deal as I think mine as taken off.  Sorry to hear 
 about Jason.  Would like to come for a visit, or meet you somewhere, say 
 Santa Fe,  when time permits.
