 use the system would be good.  We should definitely avoid being too technical.

 Mark -- Chris and I were thinking that the standard presentation -- if it 
 isn't too technical -- would be appropriate.    What are your thoughts?  Lisa

 Yes.
 
 What kind of demo is he looking for?
 
 Is it just a general overview (i.e. the standard EnronOnline presentation)?

 David -- Would you be available on March 6th (around 3 - 3:30) to provide a 
 demo of EOL for the Chairman of the CFTC?  He'll be meeting with Jeff 
 Skilling before you, so  you'll be in good company!!
 
 Let me know if you can help us out.  
 
 Thanks,
 
 Lisa
