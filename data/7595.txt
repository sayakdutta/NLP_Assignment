 
 I apologize for the late notice, but Sally has just been notified that a 
 cross-functional PRC meeting w/ Rick Causey has been set for this Friday, 
 December 1.  She will need a compilation of your accomplishments by 
 Thursday.  If you have directors reporting to you, please request that they 
 also have data in to Sally by Thursday.
 
 Thanks for your help,
