 
 This looks like a run-of-the-mill conference except that the guest list is 
 fairly senior.  Any interest? If not, let Amy know.

 Steve,
 
 Attached is information about a conference sponsored by the Association of 
 Energy Services Professionals International (AESP) taking place this August.  
 We received a request for an EES Executive speaker for the Symposium, but 
 felt that it would be more appropriate for an Executive from Corporate to 
 consider speaking here.  There are Executives from companies such as The New 
 Power Company, Cinergy and Entergy committed to speaking at the event.  More 
 information can be found in the document below.
 
 Please let me know if you have questions or comments.
 
 Thank you,
 Amy Buehler
