 Mark:
 
 As you may recall, I interviewed with you in the fall of 1997.  I ended up
 accepting an offer from Koch before going through the last round of
 interviews (4th)  with Enron.
 
 Over the past 2+ years, I have been the only power attorney at Koch.  Among
 other functions, I have supported the power trading operations, the power
 project development operations, and Koch's retail power accounts.  The work
 has been challenging, exhilarating and at times overwhelming from a work
 load perspective.  I truly love my job.  While I cannot complain about the
 job experience, Koch as a company leaves much to be desired.
 
 I would love to work for such an innovative company as Enron; your company
 sets the standard in our industry.  I would love to talk to you about any
 potential employment opportunities with Enron.  Please contact me if you
 think I could bring value to you and Enron.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Tim Beverick, Attorney
