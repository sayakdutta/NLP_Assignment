 per my voice mail, can we use this version?
 
 Thanks,
 Dave

 Les,
 
 Attached please find a draft Consulting Services Agreement for Gary Gentry.  I'll need some input from you on Exhibit A, as well as the rate to use in the compensation section (Section 2.01).  Otherwise, this document should be in a form that will facilitate quick negotiation/execution with Gary.  I'm still waiting on a response from EE&CC Legal (John Schwartzenburg) re getting a release from some of the continuing obligations that Gary has under his previous CSA with them.  I suggest that we obtain any such release in a separate document in order not to slow our progress on this document.
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions or comments at your convenience. 
 
 Kind regards,
 Dan
