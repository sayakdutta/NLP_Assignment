 I'm in meetings all day tomorrow (wednesday) and on Friday afternoon.  
 Anytime on Thursday or Friday morning is good.  Just let me know.  Thanks, 
 Paul
 

 
 Ok.  When are you available to discuss how to deal with the various issues
 we need to address to get this wrapped up?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay

 Kay:  references to WestLB are in only a few places in the GE Contract;
 namely, the recitals and sections 3.8(c)(2), 5.1, 6.1, 7.2.4, 30.7 and
 30.12.  The references in the recitals, 3.8(c),7.2.4, 30.7 and 30.12 can be
 handled fairly easily.  The references in 5.1 and 6.1 deal with pricing
 matters and will require a little work once the pricing mechanism is worked
 out with GE.  My suggestion would be to not revise the document at this
 time and make these changes at the same time we make any other changes
 arising from the discussions with GE.  PLease let me know what you think.
 Regards, Paul
 

 
 Thanks.  This is a  very drastic situation, so the draft will be
 appreciated.
 
 As I recall you were going to turn another draft of the GE facility
 agreement, deleting the WestLB references.  When will this be forthcoming?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay

 Peter Thompson is working on it.  We should have a draft Wednesday.

 Paul,
 
 When can we expect a draft of the ABB facility agreement? It is getting
 urgent.
 
 Thanks,
