 Enron Corp. does not give unlimited guaranties.  The amount will be determined by our Credit Department based upon the credit in your draft ISDA.

 Marie,
 
 One more quick question.  In line 1 (b) below in the guaranty, the cap
 amount of the guarantee was left blank.  Is Enron willing to not cap the
 guaranty amount, or does this term still need to be negotiated?  Thanks,
 
  - Lissa
 
 "1 (b)  The aggregate amount covered by this Guaranty shall not exceed U.S.
 $________."
 
 
     
 
 Lissa:
 
 I must be having problems with my e-mail as I tried to reply to yours
 and was told it couldn't be delivered, so that's why I'm sending you a
 new one rather than a reply.
 
 Attached is the proposed form of guaranty that Enron Corp. will provide.
 ECT Investments would only collateralize above the threshold, since you
 would have a guaranty for the rest.
 
 We look forward to receiving your schedule.
 
 Marie
