 
 Thanks Mike.  Would you mind providing the MW and heat rate assumptions that correspond to these flows just for information purposes.
 
 
 Thanks,

 Charlie,
 
 The new plant max consumption for planning purposes should be set at 2,490 mmBtu/hr HHV.  In addition to this it is estimated that the existing Frame 5 may require 335 mmBtur/hr HHV, or a total of 2,825 mmBtu/hr HHV.
 
 The plant consumption is based on the maximum combustion turbine requirement, plus a 5% margin, plus duct burning requirement.  This should be adequate as a conservative maximum case.
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
 Thanks!
 
 Mike Coleman
