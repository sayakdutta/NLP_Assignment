 
 Let me add my thanks for your willingness to sign these things for us.  The 
 guys in London never think about lining up a signatory in Houston ahead of 
 time who might actually know something about what they're signing and why 
 they're signing it.
 
 Any chance you'll be in NY Monday night?  I'm taking a few people to dinner & 
 you might enjoy it.

 We received all outstanding documentation overnight from Houston. The Enron 
 amendments to the financing will become effective today. This then clears the 
 way for the banks to syndicate which will happen on Monday morning at a 
 signing at A&O.
 
 It only remains for ETOL (David or Treasa) to sign the syndication agreement 
 which will be couriered here today for that purpose.
 
 This will mean there will be nothing outstanding for any Enron entity to sign 
 on Monday. It may however be politic to have an Enron presence at the signing 
 on Monday to meet the banks. I will leave Gonzalo to coordinate that with Nat 
 West. 
 
 Thank you to everyone in Houston who scuttled around getting documents signed 
 for us. Your efforts are appreciated.
