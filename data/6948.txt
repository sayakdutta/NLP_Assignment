 Happy St. Patrick's Day!
 I'm moving this weekend to another apartment in the same complex.  We're
 overlooking the pool now, so stop by and visit.  I've attached the new
 address.  Phone numbers will remain the same.
 
 Things here in Houston are going well.  I'm going to Eastern Europe March
 29-April 11.  The tentative schedule is Budapest, Prague, Munich, Salzberg,
 Vienna, and Marseille.  The weekend after I get back is the MS-150 bike ride
 
 from Houston to Austin, so wish me luck!
 
 
 Hope all's well,
 Brian
