 	at this time, but if we get some before the 29th I will pass it on to you.  Thanks. Lynn
 
  
     
 Could I get more information on what the point issues are with the Oneok OBA's?  Are there certain contracts in question? Does it have to do with crossing mids, or operators of points, or having receipts and deliveries on the same OBA?  
 
 Also, can someone be called in from my group to attend just the portion of the meeting when you discuss the above?  We are all involved in testing for the new CMS/CRS systems and if we are not needed for the entire meeting, it would help to only attend the portion we are needed.
 
 Let me know
 
 Karen

 	I talked with Delaine today to firm up our meeting on the 29th.  Here is the plan.
 
 	11:30 - 12:00  -  Lunch in the building (Ava can you get Trebeards)
 
 	12:00 - 4:30   -  Discuss:
 
 				Midcontinent Market Center I/C at Bushton
 				Points that are on the wrong OBA
 				Imbalances on the Gathering OBA
 				American Processing Issues (Robert)
 
 	Let me know if we need to add anything else or have any quetions.  I think this will take the majority of
 	the afternoon.  
 
 	Ava, please get us a room (preferrably 4102) for the afternoon.  
 
 	Attendees from Oneok are:  Delaine Kurth, Kim Hardman, Sherry Rogers, maybe one other person.
 
 	Thanks. Lynn
