 HE 10 EDT - Just an FYI that the purchase price was changed to $41/MW from $42 at the request of Exelon to our Settlements group.  I went ahead and changed it due to the low value and because it is in our favor.  If you disagree with this or have any questions, please let me know.
 
 Thanks,
 Marci
