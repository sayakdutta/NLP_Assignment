 Due to the current circumstances, we will be moving all of our current Enron
 GMAT classes from the Enron building to our main office location.  The
 schedules will remain the same, but your class will now be meeting at 701
 North Post Oak Road, Suite #8.  If you have any other questions, please give
 us a call.  We hope the best for your future.
