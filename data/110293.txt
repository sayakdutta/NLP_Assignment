 
 Actually, I don't know the number yet.  Cell phone still the best.  Sorry, I haven't been available last night.  I was out.  Anyway, what's the news?

 Hey there!
 
 How was your birthday?  I wasn't able to get ahold of
 you.  I feel badly because I wanted to wish you a
 Happy one.  I hope that it was, and that you were able
 to relax a little bit.
 
 Do you know your new phone number?  I would like to
 talk with you soon if you do.  I have news to tell
 you!
 Tis weekend is a long weekend.  I was originally
 supposed to go to Boston, but Loretta and I changed
 our minds.  I think she is moving into a new place
 this weekend.
 
 I hope all is well.  Talk to you soon.
 
 Christine:)
