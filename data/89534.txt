 Hey!
 
 I am going to Omaha the weekend of this game.  It is one of those games every true husker fan must attend.  Let me know if ya'll may be interested or just drop me a line to let me know that you are still alive.  I think the huskers can beat OU since our D has improved so much.  I worry about the Offense not showing up on every play.
 We will need a better pass rush to beat OU.  How good are we this year?  We'll find out at this game.  KSU sucks.  OUT.
