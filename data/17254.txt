 Thanks very much.  If it works for you, I'd be happy to come to your office 
 on either day to meet and catch up.  Just let me know.  I can be flexible.  
 Have fun in DC.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Jeff,
 
 Thanks for all of the updates. I am off to DC with Chambers, but would like 
 to have an opportunity to talk again when I return later next week. Let me 
 know what times are free for you Wed. (3/7) or Thurs. (3/8).
 
 Regards,
 
 Laura
