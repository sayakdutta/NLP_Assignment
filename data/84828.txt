 money under (and Events of Default thereunder) and also needs to have 
 exhibits prepared.  We probably also should check to see if there are any 
 existing Security Interest in these assets.  The ones we know that we are 
 subordinate to should be noted in the mortgage.  Shonnie has a contact in 
 Wyoming she has used before to search the county records for any existing 
 security interest.
