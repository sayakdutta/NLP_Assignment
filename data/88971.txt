 Debra--
 
 The attached contract has reciprocal $10MM thresholds.  I did not agree to that with the counteraparty when I spoke to them on Friday afternoon.  I went ahead and only agreed to raise Duke's threshold to $5MM (and to keep ours at $10MM).
 
 Please send a revised contract draft to the counterparty.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Veronica
 
  
     
 
 Robin, I have redlined changes to Thresholds in section 11.  Please review and let me know.  Thanks !!
