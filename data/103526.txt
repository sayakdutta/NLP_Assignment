 In advance of your calling me later this afternoon, I set out below some 
 thoughts the issues to be discussed:
 
 1. Jurisdiction - under the English law Annex the preferable route is 
 recourse to the courts - I can confirm that this is Enron London's policy.
 
 2, Non-reliance:  From our telephone conversation yesterday, I understood 
 that you said that the CP would be relying on us.  I believe that this should 
 not be the case and the usual non-reliance provisions should apply.  If this 
 is not the case, then
 
 3. the additional para. (h) that you faxed me earlier today, I am informed, 
 is unnecessary.  I also understand that the practical effect of those 
 provisions might be to scare the CP.
 
 Please call me so that we can discuss any of the above and/or to confirm that 
 you are happy for the documents to go out to the CP.
 
 Thanks
 Michael
