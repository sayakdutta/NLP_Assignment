 
 Hello!   Hope your day is going well.  As for me, it has been pretty busy.  
 Dropped my tux off at lunch and it only took about 2 seconds.  I know you 
 were looking forward to going with me to drop that off, but you missed out.  
 
 I had a great time this weekend.  Thanks again for accompanying me to the UH 
 affair extraordinair.  Nice dress!!  Have a great rest of the day and I will 
 talk to you later.
