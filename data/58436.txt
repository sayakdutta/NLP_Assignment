 to Ashcroft for years.  Let's make sure he knows we gave it.... we need to 
 follow up with him.  Last time I talked to him he basically recited the 
 utilities' position on electric restructuring.  Let's make it clear that we 
 want to talk right after the election.

 We have received a request from the Ashcroft Senate campaign for $10,000 in 
 soft money. This is the race where Governor Carnahan is the challenger. Enron 
 PAC has contributed $10,000 and Enron has also contributed $15,000 soft money 
 in this campaign to Senator Ashcroft. Ken Lay has been personally interested 
 in the Ashcroft campaign. Our polling information is that Ashcroft is 
 currently leading 43 to 38 with an undecided of 19 percent. 
 
 Do we want to make a further soft money contriubtion of $10,000?
 
 Joe
