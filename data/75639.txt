 If the transformer contract will be assigned later to a wholly owned sub of 
 E-Next (aka the project company) it would seem that the Transfer Date should 
 probably be redefined to reference an assignment to an unaffiliated company.  
 Same thought on the GE override.  This is because the override will still be 
 in effect if E-Next owns the equity in the assignee.

 Here is the revised, and final form, of the ABB override letter for use in 
 conjunction with the FVP breakout contract for FVP.
