 
 What were the offer dates for the Gormet Group?  Didn't we offer all three weekends?  I'm open all three weekends in November, however, we might want to steer clear of the 17 just incase we decide to travel during the week of Thanksgiving.  
 
 Thanks, Kim.
 
 
     
 
 Kim - Any reason I can't tell Jane 11/3?  That's one of the Gourmet Group
 dates, but we can steer that to the 17th, I think.  Or should I offer Jane
 the 10th?  Did you have a conflict then?  JW
 
 
     
 
 Pencil in the 3d and the 17th.  We'll narrow it down to one or the other
 shortly.
 
 Looking forward to it!

 John,
 Thank you for the invitation.  We'd love to come.  We don't have any plans
 for Saturday, November 3rd, 10th or 17th.  Let us know.  Have a good weekend
 and say hello to Kim.
 
 Thanks again,
 Jane
