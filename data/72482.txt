 
 I remember that the longer I played softball, the bigger the women were.  
 When I was in my late 20's and early 30's, I played men's league, and I think 
 they were smaller than the women!
 
 
 
 

   
  
 Good Morning! Yes, that's the big girls. But, she's not as tall as the 
 picture makes her look. The player standing right behind her is only 5 feet
 tall. Some of the other girls are only about my height. There's a reason why
 we encourage her to play softball and not volleyball. If genetics means
 anything, I think her build will be more along the softball player lines! It
 may also be the angle the picture was taken.
 
 I think Annie is probably getting close to 5 feet tall, but I wouldn't swear
 on it. Probably 4'10" or so.
 
 Have a good morning!
 
 Love you!
 Lisa
