 
 I left a message for Mike Neves this a.m. to see if we could get together 
 this morning to check on things so we can open the database up.  Meanwhile, 
 what the confirmation desk could do is forward me an email for them and 
 anyone from settlement that may want access to this database.  I am going to 
 have to email people the link to get in.
