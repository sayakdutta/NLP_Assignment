 Even though, I know I'll probably be at a disadvantage because of my notification deadline, I'll try again on the S. Texas piece.
 If my memory serves me right, you were looking for a daily call option on the S.Texas piece.
 
 
 Enron offers the following:
 
 
 
 Period:				November, 2001 - March, 2002
 
 Region:				Trunkline South Texas Pool
 
 Volume:			10,000 MMBtu/d
 
 Demand Charge:		$0.0425 per MMBtu for the above referenced time period times
 				the volume, for the right to receive the volumes on a daily
 				basis at the Trunkline S. Texas " Gas Daily Daily" price.
 
 Notification Time:		7:30 a.m. 
 
 Thanks
