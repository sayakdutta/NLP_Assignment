 Paul,
  
 I noted my name on the list of interviewers below then in a later e-mail it was removed from the list.  Given the fact that you still need interviewers for first round and I had volunteered my availability to yourself and Jim Steffes, is there any reason why I would not be on this first round trip?
  
 Thanks for letting me know so I can plan accordingly!
