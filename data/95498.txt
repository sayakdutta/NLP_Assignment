 We'll just go out to dinner and a show and we'll all split it.  Sounds like 
 fun.  Good idea - must've been ML's.

 Gentlemen - I hope you all are doing well.  I wanted to follow up with guys
 on supper club.  I believe it's our turn in the "rotation".  ML and I
 thought it might be fun to change it up a bit and go some place like the
 Mucky Duck where we could eat and watch a band or go somewhere like the
 Laugh Stop for dinner and a comedy hour.  We will treat on the dinner and
 first round of drinks.  I would say on all drinks but given Kevin's past
 rampages with the bottles of wine I better not guarantee full payment of
 that at a restaurant.  If that's a problem, I can always bring Kevin a small
 flask and straw that he can have during the night. 
 
 ML talked to Lisa and I talked to Dax and it sounds like Sunday, November
 11th will be the only date that might work.  Follow back up with me and let
 me know if that will work.  Take care and talk to you soon.
