 Thanks so much for the helpful letter on membership and general information. Your letter indicated that I should make application through the Membership Committee, who would provide me with an application. You copied Cmde. Roth on the letter so I will contact him to request an application or schedule a meeting. (I have no contact information for him other than through the PYC, is that appropriate?) 
 
 I found a potential slip at Great Cove Boat Club and was wondering if you had heard of this marina and if other members used this facility.
 
 Thanks again for getting back to me.

 P.S. I heard on the news one of the pilots was from Portsmouth. So tragic. I'm sure people there are as devastated as they are here.
