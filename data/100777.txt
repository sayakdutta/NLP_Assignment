 
 That is weird.  I received your first message.  
 
 Dave, Exhibit A of the O&M agreement is a description of the Compressor Motor 
 Facilities.  Do you have this?
 Exhibit C is insurance coverages; I assume I need to get that from Nemec.
 
 Martha, please send me by interoffice mail copies of the executed documents 
 Drew has; mine seem to have vaporized.
 
 Thank you!
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 

 
  
 Thats weird, my computer just deleted the recipients from the email below.  
 I'll try again--do you guys still work here?  DF 
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 

 
  
 You guys probably don't remember this (I didn't until I checked the file) but 
 there were a couple of exhibits to the Transwestern Gallup contracts that we 
 left to be attached to the final contracts after execution.  My recollection 
 is that we were in such a hurry to get the Compression Service Agreement 
 signed and sent to FERC that we left a couple of these things to do later.  
 Now that we have the FERC order, I want to get these contracts off my desk 
 and off to Corporate Records or whereever original contracts go to die.   On 
 my originals, I'm missing Exhibit B to the CSA (which is the CDEC Rate 
 Schedule No. 21),  and Exhibits A and C to the O&M Agreement.  
 
 Susan, please coordinate with Gerald to get these exhibits in our respective 
 files and we can send these contracts off to the central rathole and be done 
 with it.  Thanks to you all.  DF
