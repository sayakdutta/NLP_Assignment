 
 Are you ready for the visitors this weekend?
 Hope the weather is great!
 
 Looks like tonight will be really stormy.
 Flash flood warning is in place.
 Sounds like things should clear up and be beautiful by noon on Saturday.
 Jarrod's birthday is Monday so we are planning on taking 3-4 kids with us to the lake house.
 
 Have a good day.
 Talk with you this weekend.
