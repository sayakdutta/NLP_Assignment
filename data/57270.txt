 On Saturday, January 13, 2001, an earthquake shook Central America.  The 
 earthquake, which had a magnitude of 7.6, was centered off of El Salvador's 
 central coast.  The death toll is currently at 700, and the damage has been 
 estimated at nearly $1 billion, nearly half of the country's annual budget.  
 
 Enron employees are encouraged to donate to relief efforts and to take 
 advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your 
 donation.  Enron will match, dollar for dollar, every donation that you make, 
 up to $15,000 annually per employee.  Listed below are a multitude of
