 provided by the state of Colorado for the T-7000 Centaur under permit 
 97LP0653 :
 
   PM10   14.000/MMSCF
 
   TSP   14.000/MMSCF
 
   NOx   0.100/MMBTU
 
   CO   0.121/MMBTU
 
   VOC   0.0348/MMBTU
 
   Formaldehyde  0.00438/MMBTU
 
   acetaldehyde  0.00546/MMBTU
 
 
 As you already know, the emissions factors for the Centaur 50H turbine under 
 permit 97LP0885 can be found on page 5 of this permit which was issued on 
 October 6, 1999.
 
 Remember, the state has given us until May 19 to have the rolling emissions 
 calculations completed for both turbines at the facility.
