 
 I thought you might want to be the Tariff Integration group's liason to the 
 Provisions/Requirements Content Group since that group is dealing with 
 interconnection issues.  You weren't at the meeting when the assignment came 
 up so I said you might be interested in the assignment and that I would take 
 responsibility for asking you if you wanted the job.  Are you interested?  I 
 don't have your phone number.  I'm at 503-464-8862.
