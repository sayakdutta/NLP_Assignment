      I'm fine with the letter.  And, I think that it should be well received.

 A development out of Washington today was Daschle's instruction to
 Bingaman to take energy legislation directly to the floor of the Senate
 and bypass the mark-up process in the Committee. Although this doubtless
 
 primarily driven by ANWR dynamics, we do not know whether any Alaskan
 gas line legislation is to be part of a Bingaman bill or not. It does
 underscore the need to make a vigorous representation to the Senators
 from our re-enlistment group. I'd appreciate that you can provide a
 response to my email from yesterday containing a draft letter from
 ANNGTC/Foothills on behalf of the re-enlisting partners. I'll be in my
 office throughout the day . So look forward to your help.
