 eze-  i got your message and i might be up for yoga tonight.  i went to core last night and it was nice and mellow.  do you have any idea who teaches the 7:30 class?  i went a while back and it this hyper-active guy taught the class and it wasn't so good - adding that to the rockne risk makes it a dangerious proposition.  
 
 do you happen to have janice's email address?  jai and i haven't been to earls in a long time and i was wondering how she was doing.  if you see her when you're working, tell her i said hi.
