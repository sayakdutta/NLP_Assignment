 Kay: The issue has arisen as to whether the current draft of the GE contract 
 incorporated comments of Rose Engeldorf and Lisa Bills.  I want to make sure 
 that Rose and Lisa have the current draft, and for that reason have asked 
 Peter to send it out.  The plan is for Peter to maintain control of the 
 document as he has in the past and to re-issue a draft that incorporates the 
 comments.

    I know that GE recently had a small comment, technical or scope
 related,  but I don't recall if it was before or after the 24th. I was
 unaware of Tom's involvement, so I want to make sure the comment was
 addressed.  
 
    I'm happy to hand the reins over to someone else to handle
 signature.  I suspect I'm creating confusion as well.

    Yes Kay.  It shlould be the last version from Peter Thompson of
 AK sent April 24th.  Tom Constantine and I just left Peter a voice mail
 to ask him to resend to Tom for a double check.  I wil ask Tom to
 forward it to you.  I have nothing to add to these contracts, and want
 to get out of the loop to eliminate confusion.
 
    This does not mean I will not help or answer any questions, just
 that Dale has asked Tom to act in Dale's place on this, and I don't want
 to screw things up....
 
    TOM - when received or confirmed from Peter, would you please
 send a copy to Kay Mann as well (as requested below).
 
        
                             
       Could you email me the last version of the turbine
 contract?
 
       thanks,
 
       Kay
