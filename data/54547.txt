 
 Becky,
 
 I gave the %% for EGM to Shirley. I assume she communicated this info to you 
 already.
 I assume EGM includes F/X - I/R (Gary Hickerson), weather, insurance (Jere 
 Overdyke),
 oil trading and coal.
 
 For CALME I don't have any info. Let's split the cost evenly.

 Shirley,
 
 GRM is now with EGM group.  EGM wants to verify that the 17.5% we are going 
 to allocate to GRM is for the Insurance, Jere Overdyke group.  EGM seems to 
 think that their Weather, Mark Tawney group, is receiving support from 
 Research.  Also, can we break out the support for CALME?  CALME is going to 
 split into 3 BUs and I am trying to determine who I need to bill for Research 
 supports.  If you have any questions, call me.  Thanx.
