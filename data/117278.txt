 
 I spoke with Stacey Carey today after the ISDA call.  I reiterated that we 
 have been willing to support the process so far on the understanding that we 
 would prefer a bill that gives us parity with financial products and, failing 
 that, the minimum we can accept is a bill which exempts (preferably excludes) 
 energy commodities and hopefully metals from the Act.   She confirmed that 
 ISDA will continue to push for the exemption or exclusion.
 
 The comments from Treasury to Chris Long recently underscore that our "Phil 
 Graham card", to the extent we have one, is a significant political strength 
 for us and we should not play the card until we need to.  Stacey agreed with 
 a statement made by Don Moorehead on this morning's call that Graham will not 
 start to move in the process until the House has produced a viable bill.  
 Given that we should probably not seek his help until a bit later in the 
 process - possibly mid September.

 Do you think that a bill favorable to energy will be passed over the strong 
 opposition of the CFTC?  What kind of odds do you put on it?  It is a 
 significant change if Treasury is not longer against us -- but it is a little 
 hard for me to believe that it is real.  Should I try to make a trip to 
 Washington in September?  Let me know.
