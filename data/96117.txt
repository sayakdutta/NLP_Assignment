 Got your email - I don't know of any openings now but will certainly keep my 
 eyes and ears open, and if I hear of anything I will let you know.  Good luck 
 to you in your search - with your self realizations in tow (cynicism is 
 always appreciated and confidence is a boon) , I'm sure an even better 
 opportunity will present itself.
