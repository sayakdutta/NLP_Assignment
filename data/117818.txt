 pretty much estimate the percentages on a quarterly basis.

 A suggestion.  I assume that whatever time I spend working for Global Assets, 
 you will be charging back to the Global Assets group.   To keep things easy, 
 I will be happy to let you know as often as you need the percentage of my 
 time spent with the Global Assets group.   If you have other plans please let 
 me know and I will be happy to do whatever is necessary to keep this simple 
 and easy.
