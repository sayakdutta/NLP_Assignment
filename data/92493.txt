 Jeff Gossett has indicated to me that you are the person responsible for the 
 Benchmark and NGP&L cost center (cc107074). I left you a voice mail 
 indicating that I would send you a copy of energy operation's activities.  We 
 are still in a phase-in process where we are trying to make this process as 
 efficient and easy for you as possible. 
 
 For now, if you could:
 Identify the activities being performed by your team (cc107074), and the 
 hours worked during the month of October
 Identify drivers for your activities. This would be things that affect your 
 workload, for example, in RM Texas the driver is # of deals; please call me 
 if you need further clarification
 Identify the commercial teams that you guys support
 
 
 
 Our goal is to have this information by Wednesday, Nov. 8, if this is going 
 to be a problem, please let us know.  Next month, you will be able to access 
 cc107074 through the normal survey, which is through MS Access.
 
 Please call either myself, x3-597, or Shari Mao for further information.
 
 Thanks,
 Jen Reside
