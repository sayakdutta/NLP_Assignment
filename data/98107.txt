 I spoke with Becky Noecker re Great Lakes. It is primarily a Canadian
 pipeline transporting Canadian gas to the US. It transports a little
 Michigan production but not from federal leases and it does not measure that
 gas for royalty purposes. Great Lakes raised this informaly with Figa and
 his response was to list many things Great Lakes would have to prove in
 order for Grynberg to dismiss. Great Lakes then sent a notice letter for
 Rule 11 purposes and Figa dismissed rather than allowing the Rule 11 motion
 to be filed.  Becky also asked me what we'd found out about whether Boies
 new partner has done any Enron work. Any news on that front?
