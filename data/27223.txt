 I need some help on the schedule for September 20th.   Steve Olinde is on vacation this day.   I intended to cover for him,  but I am now trading the dailies for Frontera.     I will not be able to cover the RT shift.
 
 I know that you are working alot of days before then,  but I would appreciate your help.
 
 Thanks,
 
 JMF
