  Original Form Agreements
 
 
 
 At the request of Peter Thompson, attached are the blacklines of the
 ABB/Facility Agreement and GE/Facility Agreement showing changes from
 the Original Form Agreements and the Execution copies sent to you on
 Friday, January 12th. Peter will be out of office today, therefore,
 please contact Chris Cobb at (202) 662-3016 if you have any questions.
 
     Al, you also mentioned January 3rd. as the date Peter was looking
 for the Agreements.  If this is correct, could you let Chris Cobb know
 and specify whether that is to be the effective date.
