 
 Stacy,
 
 Currently I have pending on my desk a GISB from you however, ENA's special 
 provisions are not included.  Also, a draft of a Master agreement was sent to 
 Markwest this summer.  Can you give me an update on the status of the 
 purposed draft?   With regards to the GISB, we can discuss ENA's special 
 provisions at your convenience.   
 
 Please let me have your thoughts.
 
 Best regards,
