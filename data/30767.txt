 Please complete the attached schedule of the 2001 plan accounting costs and headcount.  The schedule should include the costs for all accounting, structuring and tax departments, but exclude mid-office support, customer services, etc.   Please e-mail me the completed schedule by the end of the Friday.  We will be presenting this information to Rick Causey on Monday.
 
 Thanks
