 
 The ESCA energy management system (EMS) in an industry standard software package to provide control area services and energy accounting in compliance with NERC standards.   We used the software and hardware for remotely controlling/operating/dispatching our peaker plants and also used the software in 3rd party "outsourcing/services" deals in ERCOT and SPP.
  
 I hope this helps.

 Can you let me know what this software and hardware do? 
 
   
     
 
 
 
 It is proposed that these will be transferred to the Netco.  The hardware and software were purchased by ENA or EPMI (I have been trying to obtain the answer to this question from accounting).  It is proposed that the $1.5 million outstanding payable to the vendor ESCA would remain with the estate.  Please let me know if you have a problem with this.
