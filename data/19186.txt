 >       Yesterday, the Commission issued an OII to determine the
 > adequacy of Sempra Energy's, SoCalGas' and SDG&E's gas transmission
 > practices and to determine what measures need to be taken to correct any
 > deficiencies.  The OII orders the Sempra affiliates and parent to
 > demonstrate that SDG&E's gas supply and transmission system are adequate
 > to provide service to present and future core and noncore customers.
 > 
 >       As you may recall, the OII sprang from an AL that SDG&E
 > filed in August requesting emergency review and approval of its proposals
 > to temporarily revise gas transportation service elections to its noncore
 > customers.  SDG&E subsequently pulled the advice letter after the
 > Commission issued a resolution rejecting it and outlined an OII it was
 > going to issue on this matter.  The language in the OII that was issued
 > yesterday is substantially similar to that which was in the Commission's
 > original draft resolution.

 >       The Sempra companies have been ordered to appear at a soon

 > 
 >       1. SDG&E has adequate gas transmission supply for the
 > 2000/2001 winter heating season, as well as the longer term supply
 > throughout the year.  If supply is inadequate, SDG&E shall submit plans
 > for obtaining adequate supply.
 >       2. SDG&E gas and transmission supply is adequate to meet
 > anticipated need for gas fired generation.  If not, SDG&E shall submit
 > plans for obtaining adequate supply.
 >       3. SDG&E's gas transmission service is not being adversely
 > affected by interests of its corporate affiliate.
 >       4. Recently added demands on SDG&E's capacity are not
 > negatively impacting supply for SDG&E's customers. and otherwise
 > consistent with representations made to the Commission.
 >       5. SDG&E's current gas curtailment rules are just and
 > reasonable; if not, SDG&E shall propose changes.

 > However, given everyone's sensitivities to EG concerns, its a proceeding
 > that could easily be expanded beyond its current narrow focus.  I'll
