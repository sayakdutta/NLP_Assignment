 Stephanie,
 
 
  We would like to set up the central books as their own Master books to 
 prevent all deals being booked to Hunter's Intra-Central book.
  Could you please set up the traders with their own physical and financial 
 book names in EOL?
   - attatched is a lists of the book names.
 
 
  Thanks,
 
 
   Kam
