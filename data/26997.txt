 I am so sorry to hear about your dad.  I know how hard it is to lose a parent.  Please remember that you are in my thoughts.

 I wanted you to know that my father passed away on October 6.  He was ill for most of the summer and his heart finally gave out.  Through shared experiences, you were on my mind and it helped me through the process.  Thank you for being my friends.
