 
 sounds good.  have a good time.  i think i am going to stay in town and golf.  we will go party some other time.
 
  
     
 
 hey!  I got your message this morning.  I didn't even end up going out. 
 I came home and went straight to bed - i was so tired. 
 I did good on the two parts that I studied for.  But the other two - I had 
 no freakin clue what was going on.  I pulle the ole' "if in doubt, choose B or C". 
 Oh well. 
 What are you doing this weekend?  
 I'm going to Austin this afternoon. 
 My friend, Erika, (that moved to N.Y.) will be there and I'm going to hang out with 
 her and Kate.  Do you remember them?  Erika is the tall girl that lived with Shirley and 
 Mike Ecklund.  Kate is the blonde that used to hang out with me a lot. 
 Get this - Kate was dating a guy from Austin for about a year and she moved there 2 months ago. 
 Well, he just dumped her.  Can you believe that?  He begged her to move there and she doesn't 
 know anyone else there. 
 Anyway, she is pretty upset - so i'm going to party with her this weekend. 
  
     how did you do on your test? 
      
                    hey- i'm taking off of work next week to study, so i wanted to 
    send you an e-mail to tell you to come out with us Thursday.....I'll 
    be finished with the stupid test.  finally! 
    did you go out last night?
