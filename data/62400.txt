 I will make sure that the interviews are called off.  Let me know if you are interested in calling him at home.
  
 Have a great week.

 I apologize for not responding to your resume request sooner, but after
 
 careful consideration of my future career, I am hesitant to make a career
 
 change at this current time.  I appreciate the fact that Enron North America
 
 gave me the opportunity to discuss the potential for employment with an
 
 executive of the organization.  Unfortunately with the birth of my son, I am
 
 hesitant to make any career change right now.  Based on the aforementioned
 
 and in consideration of the valuable time of the Enron management team, I
 
 would request that we cancel the meeting that has been scheduled for this
 
 Wednesday.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Edward Reitze
