 
 This one kind of gives you that warm, fuzzy feeling inside.  Knowing that you 
 are benefiting mankind by working for the Big "E".  
 

  
 You mock what you don't understand.....The Dyner will do the same deal 3 
 years from now, but LOSE $666trillion, and call it revolutionary and 
 strategic to their business.

 A different view of Enron...
 
 ----------












  
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 -----------------------
 Today Enron and Hades announced a definitive energy services agreement said
 to be worth an estimated $666 Trillion.
 In the deal, Enron will provide both gas and electric commodities to Hades'
 facilities throughout and under North America.  John D. Rockefeller, former
 CEO of energy monopolist Standard Oil, is now head of Hades' energy
 management division.  Said Rockefeller, "Obviously Hell has significant
 heating demands.  While eternal flames are a great idea in concept, they
 require vast and reliable fuel resources.  Enron was the only supplier
 willing to make a deal with my boss, and, as a former monopolist, I just
 like the way they do business."
 A spokesperson for Enron said the two cultures were able to work easily
 together during negotiations.  According to the company, "The deal fits both
 companies exceptionally well.  With Hades' ability to attract and retain new
 customers, we see this as a fabulous growth opportunity for millennia to
 come."  According to several energy industry insiders, Hades' high heating
 demand with very little need for summer air conditioning make it a very
 attractive energy portfolio addition.
 Hades is a multinational corporation with millions of sites worldwide and
 approximately 173 quintillion customers.  The entity boasts sustained high
 growth rates over the last two thousand years.
 Enron is one of the world's leading energy and communications companies.
 The company owns approximately $37 billion in energy and communications
 assets.  Enron ranks in the top quarter of Fortune's "Best 100 Companies to
 Work For if You Can Keep A Job There and Don't Mind Working 80 Hours A
 Week," and is among the most respected corporations in America, as ranked by
 customers with respect-us-or-get-curtailed clauses in their energy supply
 contracts.
