 In addition to the facility agreements, the parties will execute the override

 Attached please find the Fountain Valley/GE Facility Agreement and
 Exhibits, as well as blacklines (the first two documents) showing
 changes from the form documents.
 
 To complete each, we will need:
 
 1. The contact information for Sections 6.7.2, 25.1 and 25.3 of the
 Agreement.
 
 2. Please have the business team confirm the Purchase Amount and
 the Guaranteed Delivery Dates.  The information that I pulled off of the
 spreadsheet that you provided (which is the information incorporated in
 the Agreement) is inconsistent with the information that Alan Larsen
 provided.
 
 3. Do we want to use the Exhibit B-1 (Specification) from the
 original West LB Agreement for this deal?
 
 4. Do we need Exhibit R (Schedule of Witness Test Points)?
 
 5.  Exhibit H will be attached prior to execution.
