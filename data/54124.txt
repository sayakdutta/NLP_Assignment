 Folks:
 
 I have tentatively set the date for our first round-table discussion for 
 Wednesday, 
 December 20th at 3:00pm-4:30pm.  The room, EB3268, will be available from 
 3:00 to 5:00pm.   If any of you have an issue with the date, please let me 
 know by 
 day's end.
 
 Professor Don Kouri of the Physics Department of the University of Houston 
 will start 
 with an informal 30-45 minute presentation (see appended abstract below) of 
 his work 
 and will then lead a discussion as well answer questions that we may have.
 
 Professor Kouri, please let me know if you have any requirements for 
 audiovisual 
 or other equipment.
 
 This excerpt from a previous correspondence provides an insight to the 
 subject of our meeting:
 
 [...]   topics to
 be discussed at a small ``roundtable'' format meeting, are:
 
 1. HDAFs for data analysis, including ``gap-filling'', data
 extrapolation, denoising, mathematical manipulations of digital
 data (e.g., taking derivatives, applying functions of differential
 operators to digital data, etc.)
 
 2. HDAFs as the basis of numerical algorithms for solving nonlinear
 partial differential equations, particularly for equations for which
 existing methods encounter stability problems.
 
 There are certainly other areas of interest and applications of the
 HDAFs but I think that even trying to do both of the above in a
 single meeting would be difficult. Of course, in this first meeting
 we would focus on general aspects of the HDAFs that make them robust
 for such applications. If, however, you have other topics in which
 you are interested, I am willing to focus on them.

 Folks:
 
 I am trying to set up a meeting with professor Don Kouri of the University of 
 Houston and I believe you may have an interest in the topic of discussion.  
 If you know of other interested parties, or want to substitute a proxy for 
 yourselves, please let me know.
 
 This first meeting with Dr. Kouri will introduce the participants to his area 
 of research (HDAFs for data analysis) and allow us to define the contents and 
 attendants of a seminar (to come up soon).
 
 We are looking to hold this discussion this week (hopefully) and to have the 
 seminar happen before Christmas (given that this is the in-between semester 
 season for schools).
 
 A couple of other similar meetings will follow up: Dr Kevin Bassler  will be 
 talking about Microscopic Simulation of Economic Markets and Dr. Pinsky about 
 the Effect of Solar phenomena on the Earth's atmosphere.

 Hi Yannis,
 I got your email without any problem. 
 Regarding timing of a meeting, I am free from teaching duties now
 so I am flexible. I will be in Houston all of December. I look
 forward to hearing more from you. With best wishes,
 Don Kouri
