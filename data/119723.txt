 It is summer again and the gas pricing in place between Harbor and Enron no longer represents the market value of the product.  In talking to the gas desk, the new pricing we propose to be effective on June 1 will be:
 
 Demand Charge of $.25/MMBtu times 16,000 MMBtu/d
 Commodity Charge of Gas Daily Mid times usage.
 
 I believe this pricing represents the bid in the market for service provided.  I will call you to discuss this important issue. 
 
 Thanks for your help.
