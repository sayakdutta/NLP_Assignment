 Greetings & Salutations!
 
 I received a phone call from an agent with Martha Turner who had seen
 your house when it was listed.  He has a client who cannot find what
 they want on the market and asked if you were interested in selling.
 
 I checked as thoroughly with him  as I could making sure it was not some
 sort of bottom feeder looking for an Enron 'fire sale' and told him that
 you had spent large sums of money renovating.
 
 He says they are looking up to the low $2 millions.
 
 I let him know I was not optomistic about it, but I would check with
 you.
 
 Hope all is well and you're surviving all of the garbage.
