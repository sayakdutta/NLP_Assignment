 
 Robin,
 
 Thanks for your call this morining.   As stated,  I am unaware of any changes 
 in our agreements or terms with regards to Canadian  companies or 
 transactions.  If  "Caraway" is the correct spelling,  I find no person by 
 that name in our credit departments.  Do you have a phone number for this guy?
 
 Regards,
