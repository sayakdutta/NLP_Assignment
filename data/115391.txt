 2/22 - reflects trade date in CDWR confirmation letter. I've left a copy of 
 the confirm letter on your desk just in case. Let me know if you have 
 questions.

 do not reflect the option in the system.  we will take care of that if we 
 exercise the option.  it would be good to get the proper transaction 
 execution date in there.

 Tim - would you like a copy of this deal's confirmation letter?
 
 Carla - you entered this deal on 2/23/01. Should it be back-dated to match 
 trade date on confirmation letter?
 
 Thanks,
 Kate
