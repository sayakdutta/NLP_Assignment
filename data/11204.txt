 no onjections. Traditionally Sutton has looked at the range and made the 
 decision where to be inside the range. I don't know if Skilling will do the 
 same. I have a voice mail into him to see. Rick

 Rick,
 
 The valuation ranges for EcoElectrica and Corrinto, as revised, are as 
 follows:
 
 EcoElectrica: High - $240.8 million (excludes FASB125 interest; terminal 
 value discounted at 18%)
 
                          Low - $220.3 million (included $20.5 million of 
 FASB125 interest as project cost)
 
 
 Corinto:   High - $4.389 million (20% discount rate)
 
                    Low - $3.609 million (23.7% discount rate)
 
 For EcoElectrica, the argument is whether the deal team should bear the cost 
 of off-balance sheet treatment in choosing between the high and low values.  
 For Corinto, the higher discount rate and lower value reflects how RAC would 
 value this transaction as a new merchant deal, reflecting Nicaragua's 
 downgrade; the lower discount rate is consistent with the original RAC 
 discount rate and may be a reasonable discount rate for a completed plant to 
 a strategic buyer.
 
 Please let me know if you require additional information.  I am happy to 
 speak with David Haug on these if you'd like.
 
 Regards,
 
 Dave
