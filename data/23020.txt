 
 John, I have asked Mark Haedicke and John Novak to respond to your question.  Jim
 
  
     
 Jim-I'm sorry to be bothering you about this again, but I need to get your
 clearance for me to represent BP in a transaction in Bolivia where BP,
 through its partially owned subsidiary Empresa Petrolera Chaco, will be
 selling gas to Southern Cone Gas Ltd.  As I understand it, the gas is
 intended for Enron's Cuiab? power plant in Brazil.
 
 Thanks again.
 
 Regards
 
 John
