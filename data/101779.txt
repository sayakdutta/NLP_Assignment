 
 sure....name the spot
 
  
     
 back on 32.  it is only about 25% full now.  do you want to meet in the morning, around 9:30?  
 
  
     
 where are you these days?
 
  
     
 what are you needing, i have the points that are needing to be reconstucted.  Not all of them will need to be, just the ones with positions.  PWC is currently making files for each point to be stored in.  So we may need to touch base before starting.  let me know.
 
 thanks,
 chance
 
  
     
 Hey Chance,
 
 I'm going to be working on west curve validation...do you have any of the information.  Joe Parks told me to contact you.
