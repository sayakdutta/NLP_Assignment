 ATTORNEY GENERAL SUES TO REMOVE STAKEHOLDER MEMBERS OF ISO BOARD
 Seeks To Allow Replacement By Consumer-Oriented Members
 
 January 23, 2001
 01-006
 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
 
 (SACRAMENTO) - Attorney General Bill Lockyer today filed suit to have the
 26 stakeholder members of the California Independent System Operator
 Corporation vacate their office, seeking to pave the way for a newly
 reconstituted board representing the interests of consumers.
 
 The "quo warranto" action was filed in Sacramento County Superior Court.
 The lawsuit asks the court to have the 26 sitting ISO members ousted from
 their positions. The Attorney General has offered current members an
 opportunity to resign and avoid further litigation.
 
 The legal move seeks to speed implementation of the new law, AB 5X, which
 reconstitutes the ISO into a board of five members appointed by the
 governor and confirmed by the Electricity Oversight Board.
 
 Governor Davis has appointed the five new members of the ISO governing
 board pursuant to the new law.
 
 The ISO board is responsible for operating, controlling and managing the
 power transmission lines that deliver electricity throughout California and
 between neighboring states.
