 	I received a question this morning from FGU regarding a cut they got on contract 5141 for ID-2.  The total volume nominated on the
 
 	contract did not change from ID-1 to ID-2, however, they did move around some volumes on their delivery points - (decreased some
 
 	primary delivery points and increased alternate-firm delv. points).  When we did the Market Area allocation for ID-2, it looked at
 
 	the "alternate point" increase as "incremental" - even though total contract volume remained the same.  I was somewhat confused by
 
 	this cut  and talked with Joe Hoang.
 
 	According to Joe:  PLEASE NOTE that the Market Area Flowing rights for a contract are retained by:
 
 	1)   Contract
 	2)   Gas Type
 	3)   Nominator - Duns
 
 	
 	Therefore, if a shipper  has a total of 30,000 mmbtu's of flowing gas rights on a contract:  10,000 Alternate firm and 20,000
 	of Primary firm and they change their nom - reducing the Primary firm volume to 15,000 and increase the Alternate firm
 	volume to 15,000 - the additional 5,000 of Alternate firm would be considered "incremental".
 
 	FYI
