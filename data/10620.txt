 Lynn,
 
 Can you please check into BP Canada injecting more than their FDD contract quantity.  What can be done now.  What processes do we need to put in place to prevent that from happening in the future?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Sue
 
  

  
 Attached is the latest FDD status report as of December 19th.
 
 Tabs showing FDD activity for this time period for the last three years is also included.
 
 
 The GIP contracts should be at 89.90% to be on target to get to the max allowable contract quantity for the end of December.  The max target amount for GIP accounts by the end of December is 83.5%.  The average remaining balance for all GIP contracts is 95%.  To get to the tariff limit of 83.5% by Jan 1st, the GIP contracts will have to withdrawal about 1.8 Bcf, or 150 mmcfd, over the next 12 days.
 
 The 3-step & 4-step do not have a minimum requirement to be met by the end of December since minimum withdrawals for Nov/Dec is zero.
 
 The last report stated that Entergy-Koch had switched to GIP from 4-step.  This was in error.  They are still in the 4-step process.
 
 BP Canada has injected 101.16% of their contract amount.  They have 2,125,406 of GIP on a contract of 2,100,932.
 
 The percentage break out by service is GIP - 34.5%, 4-Step - 45.9%, and 3-Step - 19.5%.
 
 Overall FDD is 94.36% full.
 
 If you have any questions, please call me.
