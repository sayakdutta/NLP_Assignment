 
 I double-checked with Bob, and he said Prebon reported these two trades as 
 peak. The other two were in fact reported as off-peak - he just entered them 
 incorrectly. But as far as this sleeve goes, there's no way one side is peak 
 and the other isn't - Prebon has to make up their minds!
 
 Again, let me know what you find out. Until then, we recognize the two trades 
 as they are.
 
 Thanks,

 That's what I was confused about because Prebon shows this deal as peak and 
 we show it as peak and I know it is the other side of a sleeve.  Can you 
 double check with Bob for accuracy.

 Does this mean that 598738 should be off peak hours as well? Because 598739 
 is only one side of a sleeve deal for EES. I would think that both sides need 
 to have the same hours......
 
 Let me know, and I'll change them accordingly.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate

 598736 and 598737 have been changed to off-peak hours. But I can't pull up 
 306927. Is this the right deal number?
