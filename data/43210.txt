 
 The list looks complete.
 
 
 
 

   
  
 
 At the May meeting of EOTT's Board of Directors, we typically elect EOTT's
 slate of officers for the next 12 months.  I have attached a draft
 resolution which provides for the reelection of EOTT's current slate of
 officers.  Please let me know if I need to make any changes to this
 proposed slate before it is included in the board materials.
 
 Thank you for your assistance.
