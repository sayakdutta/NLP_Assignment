 
 Going to hear some live music tonight at Dan Electro's Blues Jam in the Heights...excited to try something different.  However, I am ditching Kates, Lis, and Laura J. so mums the word.  Just don't feel like having a dinner filled with cotton candy chat.  
 
  
     
 often think lisa was meant to live in little house on the prairie
 times....heaven FORBID should a girl go ANYWHERE by herself.  what a loser
 you must be.  how MORTIFIED she would be to know i saw cptn corelli ALONE
 last night (a sacrilege!)  AND am going to paris next week for 1 night
 ALONE....oh, and am meeting mr. swiss for drinks mon night.....he MUST be
 doing this loser a favor so i don't have to drink alone....
