 In connection with a series of FASB 125 transactions, ENA will be entering 
 into several swap transactions.  Also in connection therewith, Mark H. will 
 be asked to deliver an opinion that there is no litigation which could impair 
 ENA's ability to perform under the swaps.  Do you know of any reason why we 
 could not deliver this opinion?  The opinion will be dated sometime on or 
 prior to quarter end.
