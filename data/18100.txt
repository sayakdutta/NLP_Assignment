 If you'd planned on making a chart similar to the one that you did 
 previously, the symbols are STISPBEVA for the S&P 500 beverage index and ?STISPFOOD for the S&P 500 food index.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 As promised, I've attached a spreadsheet that offers monthly industry
 returns
 (incl. dividends) for the beverage and food industries.  There is no
 consolidated food & beverage sector.
