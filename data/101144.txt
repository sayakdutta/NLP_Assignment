 
 Wilson, my most heartfelt apologies.  I failed to include you on the last 
 email (huge oversite on my part).
 

   
 Via a quick phone call to Little Woodrow's I was informed that the "steak 
 dude" (as nstepha has coined him) cooks come rain, sleet, snow or shine.  
 Thus, our evening out is on.  See everyone there around 7:30 p.m.  If you 
 can't make it till later that's OK we'll save you a seat.  Besides, most of 
 you would probably put good money down on my being there until closing.  
 Cheers.
 
 As far a the girls go...I'm afraid I will only be bringing myself.  You know 
 these Texas girls, all my friends are either married, engaged or about to be 
 engaged.
