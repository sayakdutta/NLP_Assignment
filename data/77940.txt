 
 I want to verify that the relationship between VEPCO and NCP is sufficient to 
 justify the statement that we are negotiating a Power Purchase Agreement with 
 North Carolina.
 
 As for the statement concerning ENA owning the other peaking projects, I 
 could verify the correct Enron entities involved given a little time.  
 Perhaps we could work around it by saying that "ENA and its affiliates" are 
 involved in these other projects.
 
 I'll try to confirm the correct entity to apply.
