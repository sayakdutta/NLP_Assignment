 Scott Yeager has requested I set up a meeting for Mark Keeter to present to 
 the group his findings for the 6 month study of Managing Global 
 Network/Application Service Platform and include managing QoS end to end.  
 
 How does Tuesday May 23 in the morning look for everyone?  
 Mark, how long do you need I will schedule the conference room for.
 Also please let me know if anyone else should be invited.
