 
 Kathy,
 
 Could you please accommodate Karen's request?  If you would like, you can 
 just send it to me and I will get it to her.  If you have delivered my 
 original to me I can make make her a copy.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay

 Kay,
 
 I was wondering if it might be possible to obtain a copy of the Transformer 
 contract executed with ABB as well as any change order contracts which were 
 submitted to GE?  If you're not the person from whom I should request this 
 information, could you please point me in the right direction?  Thanks.
 
 Karen
