 Dear Dr. Kaminski--
 Chonawee Supatgiat has applied for a tenure-track faculty position in Decision
 Sciences at the Fuqua School of Business, and he has listed you as a reference.
 Do you have a letter of recommendation for him (ideally in electronic form)
 and/or can you tell me anything about his research and teaching potential?
 Thanks in advance for your help, and best wishes for the New Year.
                   Sincerely,
                                        --Bob
