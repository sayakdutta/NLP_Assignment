 on to you and see if you guys might have anywhere for him to fit. She says 
 hello and feel free to contact her  at the email address below or 
 281-283-3196.  I am also going to try and get this kid an interview in my 
 group.  Talk to you soon.

 This is Mike Wolfe's son.  He graduates this semester from Texas Tech and is
 moving back here to help his father since his mother passed away a few
 months ago.  Kevin says he is a good kid and very smart.  Could you give it
 Ashley or someone else at Enron.
 
 Thanks <<Jerrsum2.doc>>
