 MDDQ section was not changed since this version.

 Barry,  Attached are redlines of the docs with the changes we discussed 
 today.  Please pay special note to the Maximum Daily Deliverability Quantity 
 of the Confirm.  I want to discuss how this limits us and what flexibility 
 this section needs.  Please review and lets discuss.
