                               i did not.  i got up and when i came back you
       were
                sleeping
                         happily
                            in
                               the
                               middle of the bed.  i almost had to go sleep
    on
       the
                couch.
                   you
                         are

    people
       are
          in
             the
                   bed.
 
                               

                                                                                              
 
                               i slept on the edge.  you kept tugging on the
          covers
             and
                   tried
                      to
                            spoon
                               with me.  its cool though.
 
                                   


                                                                                                       
                                  whatever, you were taking up the whole
    entire
          bed
             last
                   night
                            making
                               it
                                  impossible for me to fall asleep.
