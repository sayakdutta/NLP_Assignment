 The Electronic Commerce team is working with Marketing Operations and 
 Commercial in development of the GISB Capacity Release EDI datasets.  One 
 critical step in this process is creation of a database.
 
 I would like to schedule a quick 30 minute meeting to discuss creation of 
 this database and ensure all potential interfacing groups are in the loop.
 
  * Review Objectives
  * Determine best database   -   Oracle or Sybase
  * Set Priority for DA's
 
 Currently, I have EB3013 scheduled for 2p.m. on Friday, July 14, 2000.  
 Please let me know if you are not able to attend.
 
 Thanks,

   -  This is not the file that will be given to DA's, but gives you a basic 
 idea of what we will need.
 
 
 
      -  This test plan is in a "rough" format, but will give you an idea of 
 our scope.
