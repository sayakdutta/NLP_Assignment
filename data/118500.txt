 Attached please find the most recent draft of the 1999 Supplement to the
 1993 Commodity Derivatives Definitions to be used in preparation for the
 telephone conference call scheduled for 11am New York time, tomorrow
 December 2, 1999.   You do not need to review this draft prior to the call.
 It will serve as the basis of dividing up the rates for final review.  The
 introduction and practice note will follow shortly.
