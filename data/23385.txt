 
 Cyndy, I am in receipt of Bill Ide's letter inviting me to the May 16 meeting at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C.  Because the May 16 neeting conflicts directly with an obligation to which I am committed, I will not be able to attend.  Please keep me in mind for future events.  Thank you.  Jim Derrick (ENRON).
