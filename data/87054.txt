 
 Do you know if we have actually collected on the imbalance settlement 
 payments from Koch and LIG?  Also, are we in agreement with El Paso on the 
 Stingray imbalance volume (11,973 mmbtu due Stingray)?  I have a statement 
 from El Paso showing this volume.  They want us to sign and return the volume 
 statement.  
 
 Thanks,
