 Chris - We now have a volume problem involving  Phillips Production supply 
 and  Power Gas Marketing supply and the Clinton sales.   How do we 
 reconcile?  Phillips and Power Gas Marketing are supplying statements to back 
 their numbers, and per John Singer, we are trying to use them.  This new 
 change in volumes will result in supply drafts for the differences.
 
 We really need a solution and a resolution.  Please reply.
