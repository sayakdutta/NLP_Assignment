 
 Within the next few days (I hope!) we will be able to open the Master Swap 
 Agreement Database, now called the Financial Trading Agreement Database, to 
 people outside of Legal and Credit.  You will be able to use this database to 
 verify master agreement information and special confirmation issues. 
 
 Jeff, once we  have the data inputted, you will also be able to verify branch 
 offices and adopted ISDA Definitions in the Master Agreement (that project is 
 still in progress). 
 
 Can you please send me a list of the people in your group who would like to 
 have view access to this database.  I will have to email them the link.
