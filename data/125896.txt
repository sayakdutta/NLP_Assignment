 Hey guys,
 
 Sad day.  Monitor North America is laying off people today -- ali got fired this
  morning (he was intending to come back to work this month)
 Anyway, it happened fairly quickly and without notice.  My job is safe for now,
 but who knows.  I'm going to start looking
 around I guess...not sure at what.  Ali's not sure what to do -- maybe apply for
  an MBA program.  John -- would you
 be able to give him pointers on what he should include for a Uof Chicago
 application?
 
 I'm going to see mom tonight in London.  Her surgery is tomorrow, and she's
 pretty nervous.  This is just working out to be
 a fantastic week.
 
 Liv
