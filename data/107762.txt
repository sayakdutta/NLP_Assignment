 
 Something else you may consider as a topic for our April/May meeting:  have 
 you guys looked at outsourcing your entire energy needs (gas and power in 
 particular).  We have been very successful in helping customers save quite a 
 bit of money on their energy expense, and as you see in today's power and gas 
 markets, that can be extremely valuable...
 
 Best,

 Talk to you soon.
