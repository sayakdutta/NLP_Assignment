 
 I'm still concerned about the circularity of the letter indicating that the 
 GTC will control but then the GTC says the master will control....

 Bob,
 
 The attached letter format should be used for all of the companies which have 
 not transacted online yet and for whom we wish the GTC to supercede an 
 existing master agreement. It has been approved by Mark Taylor.
 
 This can be used for all such companies going forward.
 
 
 
 Thanks,
 
 Dave
