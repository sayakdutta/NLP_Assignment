 Dear Mr. McConnell,
 
 After reading this mornings Wall Street Journal article with interest, I
 thought it appropriate to write you, introducing our firm to you and our LNG
 facilities.
 
 Coincidently, we had talked to our friends at Vinson and Elkins a few weeks
 ago about an introduction to the right person in Enron to discuss our LNG
 projects with.
 
 I am sending by courier hard copies of the items attached to this e-mail.
 
 We look forward to meeting you, and discussing the LNG opportunities in
 greater detail.
 
 
 Yours faithfully,
 
 
 Steve Meheen
