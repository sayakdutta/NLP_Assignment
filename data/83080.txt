 I am a legal assistant for Jeff Hodge.  At his suggestion,  I am contacting 
 you concerning the possibility of spending time with you or a trader in your 
 area observing "the business"  during bid week if possible, in order that I 
 may gain experience and information concerning gas trading.  A few hours in 
 the morning or whenever is best for you.  
 
 Thanks for your help!
