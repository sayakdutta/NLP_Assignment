 
 Actually ordering El Paso to do what TW already does, so if anything, affirms 
 TW's operating procedures.  El Paso has been in the cross-hairs of the entire 
 industry.  Interestingly, this suit arose from the lengthy and detailed 
 discussions we all had as part of the settlement---as you can imagine, El 
 Paso saw it as a negative outcome of those talks.  We can discuss further 
 when I'm in Houston tomorrow and Friday.
 
 Best,

 Does this have any implication for the TW capacity issue?

 Chairman Hoecker announced that FERC will hold a special meeting Nov. 1 to 
 issue a proposed order detailing possible remedies to the California 
 wholesale market based on two investigations currently underway.
 
 Only one item was discussed - an order resolving the Amoco complaint over El 
 Paso's capacity allocation.  In the order, the Commission finds that El 
 Paso's allocation of delivery point capacity at Topock is unjust & 
 unreasonable.  The Commission directs El Paso to assign primary point rights 
 to its shippers using a one-time assignment process outlined in the order.  
 If elections for primary point capacity exceed available space, El Paso will 
 pro rate the space and allow shippers to select other primary points in an 
 iterative fashion until all shippers have primary point rights equal to their 
 firm capacity rights.  Chairman Hoecker said this case illustrates the fact 
 that overbooking pipeline capacity is even more problematic that the 
 overbooking of airline capacity.
