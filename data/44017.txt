 Mr. Hyvl,
 
 Thank you for your prompt response.  We cannot issue a purchase order until
 we have a fully executed contract, so it looks like I will have to take that
 portion out of the contract.

 Christian,
      Attached is the modified contract with the changes you requested.
 Please print off 2 originals and have them signed.  Please fill in the
 purchase order number information on the invoices section of Exhibit A.  If
 the number is not available, them please delete the information requiring
 the number from the billing and payment provision.  Forward the signed
 copies to me or Janet Wallis and we will proceed with execution by ENA.

 Unfortunately, we don't have a purchase order issued yet so I can't give
 you
 a number.  I know that would make it easier for you guys, but I don't think
 we can issue one until right before the first gas purchase.  First, a
 purchase requisition needs to be issued.  Then, a purchase order will be
 released following approvals by the various individuals authorized to sign
 off on them.
 
 

  
 
 
 Christian,
      If the purchase order number will be the same for all deals under the
 contract, can you give me the number so that I can include it as a part of
 your address for Invoices.
