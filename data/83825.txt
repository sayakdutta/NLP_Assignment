 Folks,
 
 As a follow-up to Scott Neal's inquiry this morning concerning 
 portable/floating LNG opportunities for California, I have learned that no 
 such capability currently exists.
 According to Todd Peterson of Enron Global LNG, exploitation of this 
 opportunity has been the topic of some industry articles but no one, as far 
 as we know, has
 constructed such a vessel.  
 
 I did come across a proposed design for an LNG floating terminal by the 
 Italian company,Tecnomare.   I contacted them and they indicated that  they 
 have not
 built such a vessel.  It is estimated that construction of such a vessel 
 would take 2-3 years, and as one might imagine, achieving the required 
 operational and 
 environmental performance in such a vessel would be quite substantial.  
 Attached is a link to a relatively brief description of the proposed vessel,

 Please let me know if any further research is needed.
