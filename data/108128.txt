 Shanna,
 
 I have two personnel that we need to place on contract.
 
 Ted Noble was promoted to manager at year-end.  I need to put him on a one 
 year contract.
 
 Eric Scott is an analyst.  You know the story.  I need a one year contract 
 for him too.  Is the "Trader Track" available for Eric?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Gary
