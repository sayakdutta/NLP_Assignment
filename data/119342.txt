 I suppose. Nothing to tell him though.

 I put it in my original message below.  It is 832-496-0123.  Tom Hartman with San Joaquin Power. I imagine a natural.  Are you going to call him today?
 
 
     
 
 Is he a broker or a natural?  I've heard about the company through cantor. He's not going anywhere.  Everyone says they want to move fast then the jack around. You got his number?

 I didn't want to talk price with him.  He saw our ERCs (that we just sold for $15,000) on website and called Kevin's line.  I was told to pick up the phone.  I told him somebody would call him back.  Either you or I would if you didn't want to call him.  He wanted to move fast, and he mentioned he used brokers in the past.  
 
 If none are out, I think we should call and tell him.    
 
 
     
 
 Who is that and how do you know him?  I haven't seen any come on since we sold some. What was his bid?

 I just spoke with Tom Hartman of San Joaquin Power.  He wants up to 20 HGA NOx ERCS.  I told him I would have to check.  He wants to move quickly.  His number is 832-496-0123.  I know we do not have any, but I wanted to see if an arb was possible before we tell him we do not have any.
