 
 Thanks, Dennis.  If  we could get a copy of the analyst's report, it would be 
 very helpful.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 We are a retainer client of PIRA.   We have access to their monthly reports 
 as well as information available on their website.

 Dennis,
 I forwarded Jeff the Friday Platt's Electric Power Daily.
 
 The quotes are coming from Allan Stewart of the Pira Energy Group.  Do you 
 know if we have this group on contract/retainer so that we could see the 
 predictions they're making?
 
 Please let Jeff and me know.
 Jeff, if we don't have access, you probably have better contacts out there.

 do you have access to the actual report issued by PIRA, to which the article 
 refers?
