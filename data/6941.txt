 OK- Would I have asked you if I didn't want you to go??  Just like a woman.
 
  In all honesty- if you don't want to go- I probably won't go either.  I am 
 not a huge professional baseball fan- it is so slow!-  so to go to something 
 like that I really need to enjoy the people that I am with.  Don't think that 
 the tax department necessarily falls into that category- but would be 
 bareable if you were there. Just a side thought- but my dad would be so mad 
 if he knew I had the opportunity to go- but didn't.  Don't know why that just 
 popped in my head.  I guess I write e-mails using "stream of consciousness" 
 also.
 
 Also- you know- you and Jennifer are a lot alike.  You know how you send me 
 ugly e-mails when you are the last person on any group e-mail that I send 
 out.  Well- she is even worse- she just called and yelled at me- b/c she was 
 not the FIRST person on a group e-mail that I sent.

 Hey-
 
 April 10th Astros game vs. St. Louis- do you want to go??  I need to let them 
 know if I want another to get on the list for an extra ticket.
