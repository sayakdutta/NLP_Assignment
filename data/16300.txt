 
 Thanks again. 
 
 
 
 

    
 
 I have been told by the author's office that the Assembly is not going to 
 bring
 up the bill today.  Governor Davis is having a signing ceremony in Los Angeles
 today for the new Caesar Chavez holiday so many of the latino members are out.
 They need these members, baring a sudden change of heart by the Republican's,
 in order to achieve a 2/3 vote.  However, the bill is still on file for
 concurrence so we will monitor.  I'll let Sandi know.
