 
 Rick and Ted,
 
 It looks more like foxes building chicken houses as opposed to foxes guarding 
 chicken houses.
 
 I shall send a message to Bryan saying that the Research has to look under 
 the hood and examine the mechanics
 of the model in order to sign off on it. A dog and pony show is not 
 sufficient. In any case, the decision to approve
 the model should not be left to Ben and Kirstee.
 
 Please, let me know what your thinking is. 
 
 
 Vince

 Vince/Steve -- we are going to the Board in December to ask for formal 
 limits.  As you know one of the key limits at the Board level is Value at 
 Risk. To that end, it is imperative that you are comfortable with our 
 approach for calculating VaR.  We have implemented a third party risk system 
 which holds all of our positions and are in the process of putting the debt 
 positions in.  The system has a VaR engine which is being demo'd by the 
 vendor today.  Ben and Kirstee are attending the demo and if they find the 
 technology acceptable, I propose moving forward with implemantion of the 
 module.  Pls. let me know if this sounds reasonable and how you would 
 envision implementing.
 
 thanks
