 Is there someone on the California "Crisis" Team that can answer this question?
 
  
     
 Nancy, when we went through our last big DASR emergency week before last, the question was raised as to what was the effective date of a DASR, e.g., is it midnight of the day that you've submitted it, or if the utility picks up the information from their file server at 5:00 p.m. (SoCal) is does that determine the effective date such that anything submitted later would have an effective date of the following day?  Could you give us some guidance on the right answer?  We used the pickup time of the utility, in which case we had to have all the SCE DASRs submitted by about 3:00 Houston time to give CSC the ability to key the data into their system and run their batch process prior to SCE's pickup time.

 To clarify below.  The 3:00 cutoff for SCE DASRs will not allow for 480 SCE accounts.  CSC has stated they could do about 120 in an hour.  I have indicated it below in a revision.   The 480 would apply to a group of DASRs from all utilities.  Additionally, CSC has stated that from 6:00 forward, the amounts shown below are guesses of what they can do, but there is a lack of certainty.

 Mark, per our conversations, these are the details of how much CSC can handled from a DASR bandwidth perspective, and what the utility and CSC deadlines are:
 
 Central Time		DASR Ability		          UDC Pickup Deadline	
 7:00 a.m.		1200
 11:00 a.m.		960				Cutoff for EEMC
 12:00 p.m.		840
 1:00			720
 2:00			600
 3:00			480	(120 SCE)		Need to have SCE DASRs to CSC 
 4:00 - 5:00		Batch Process Shutdown
 5:00			200
 6:00			70
 7:00			50				5:00 Pacific for SCE
 8:00			--				
 9:00			Batch Process Shutdown	
 10:00
 11:00
 12:00 a.m.
 1:00 a.m.						12:00 Eastern for PG&E and SDG&E
