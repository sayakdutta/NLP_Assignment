 membership might be interested in?  Frankly I have been too busy to think 
 about this -- if you have any comments let's talk.

 About three weeks ago, I inquired about EBA's  interest in organizing a 
 concurrent session at the upcoming IAEE (International  Association for 
 Energy Economics) conference in Houston (April  2001).
 ?
 Since I did not hear back from you, I assume that  EBA was not 
 interested.??It would help us a lot in our future planning  if you could 
 perhaps help me with your reasoning.??Did we approach you  too late?(given 
 the Dec 4 deadline)??  We required all participants to pay registration fees, 
 was that an issue??  We couldn't guarantee you a slot even if you proposed a 
 session, was that an  issue?
 ?
 Thanks in advance for your response.
