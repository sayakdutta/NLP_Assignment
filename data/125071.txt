 Based on what I've seen so far, looks like June 27th.
 
 Based on that, I have tentatively booked a room 9:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. at
 the PDX Conference Center, Portland, OR.  If you haven't been there before,
 there's diagram/map at:

 Some of the items for an agenda:
 *	Elimination of preschedule flag
 *	Time table times refer to prevailing time of the sink/load control
 area
 *	Preschedule items
 *	Real-time items
 
 There are more specific items, I just haven't had enough coffee yet.  A real
 agenda out next week.
