 Will we have a meeting on Jan. 2 in your office (pre-ETS staff meeting)?  
 If so, will it be at 8:30 or can it be 9:00 am?

 This is to advise you that we will NOT have ETS Monday morning staff meetings 
 on December 18 or December 25.    
 
 Please make note that the next ETS Staff Meeting will be held on Tuesday, 
 January 2, 2001 at 9:30AM in 49C2.   And then on January 8, we'll resume our 
 regular schedule of having our staff meetings on Monday mornings at 9:15AM.
 
 Regards and Happy Holidays,
