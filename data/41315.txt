 I have sent the amendment to the Agency Agreement to Gary Hickerson for signature on behalf of ECT Investments, Inc.  When executed, I will fax you a copy.  How do you want to handle obtaining Michael Brown's signature?  Do you want me to send the original to you and you will coordinate getting his signature, or do you want me to send it to Michael directly?  I know Michael, so I don't have a problem with sending it directly to him, or I can certainly send it to someone in Legal in London to coordinate getting his signature.  Please let me know how you want to handle this.
  
 In addition, I made a few minor changes to the amendment.  ECT Investments' name is ECT Investments, Inc. with a comma between "Investments" and "Inc.".  Also, Gary Hickerson is President of ECT Investments rather than Managing Director, and I also added his and Michael's middle initials.
  
 Please let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
