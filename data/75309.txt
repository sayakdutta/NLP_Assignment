 
 I appreciate the heads up -  I'll try to chase down the fax (it hasn't been 
 delivered yet).  Can you email me the blacklines just in case?  
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
 
 
 
 


 
  
 Kay: 
 Just to clarify.  The "blacklined changes" in the fax I sent to you come
 directly from the document that you sent to us yesterday.  We will let you
 know as soon as we hear anything further.  
 
 Thanks, Karen
