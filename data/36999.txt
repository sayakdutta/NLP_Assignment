 14343 Millstone Estates Ln.
 Cypress, TX  77429
 281-304-8303
 
 Right now, we just have dial-up internet service and a local calling company that also gives us 100 minutes of long-distance.  We get off pretty cheap on this, but I would be willing to give this ION a try.  Let me know.

 Hi Darron,
 Hope all is well with you and your family.  Boy, do I have an offer for
 you!!!
 
 Sprint is looking for consumers in Houston to test our new ION
 technology.  ION stands for Intergrated On-Demand Network.  It basically
 provides your voice service and your data service over the same phone
 line.  ION offers several different products.  There is a 1 phone line
 version, 2 phone lines and up to 4 phone lines.  We also offer just a
 data/internet access only product.  The real benefit with ION is that
 when you have one phone line, you can be on the internet and talking on
 the phone at the same time.
 
 Anyway, if you are interested in helping us test ION in Houston, please
 let me know.  I will need your phone number and address to see if you
 are in our coverage area.  Of course, the service would be free of
 charge during the testing period.  If you want more information
 regarding ION, you can visit our website at www.ion.sprint.com.
 
 We need to start making plans for the KU-Texas football game!
 
 Tell everyone hello for me!
