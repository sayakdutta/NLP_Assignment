 Sara, some time ago we forwarded Louisiana-Pacific (L-P) an ISDA for their 
 review and consideration.  They have responded with the following comments.  
 Can you give me a hand in addressing them?  John

 John,
  
 Listed  below are several issues we need to have addressed prior to signing 
 the  agreement!
  
 1)  Curt Stevens name is consistently  misspelled throughout the documents. 
 We should also be sure that our new  corporate address is used.  805 SW 
 Broadway, Suite 1200,  Portland, Oregon 97205-3303.
  
 2)  Enron doesn't like late payments or early termination of their 
 agreements.  Interest on amounts owing is compounded daily.  John - this 
 needs to be changed.  What other decent  arrangements can be put in here.  (I 
 thought only loan sharks compounded  daily?)
  
 3)  Part 3 of the Schedule to the Master Agreement should be amended to 
 provide that  LP may satisfy its obligation to provide updated financial 
 information by  posting it to EDGAR or on the web. Enron now has that  
 ability.
  
 4) We  don't have the 1991 ISDA Definitions or the 1993 ISDA Commodity 
 Derivatives  Definitions cited in Parts 5 and 6 of the Schedule to the Master 
 Agreement. I  wasn't able to locate them on the web. We will need these 
 provide  to LP.
  
 5) The  Credit Support Annex is designed to apply to ISDA Agreements subject 
 to New York  law. Our Agreement is subject to Texas law. We may not have  the 
 proper form.
  
 Let me know at your convenience.
  
 Thanks
 Roger
