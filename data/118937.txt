 Bistro Mezzaluna
 Armadillo Cafe (Davie)
 Left Bank
 Hobo's Fish Joint (Coral Springs)
 Darrel & Olivers Cafe Maxx (Pompano Beach)
 
 Not sure but I think the first two may be reasonably close to the airport, the next one in Fort Lauderdale but have no idea where the last two are.  All get good marks in Zagats.  Look them up at zagats.com and see what you think.
