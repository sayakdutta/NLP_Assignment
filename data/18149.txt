 Heard from Lawrence this morning who said AB 60x (Hertzberg) is likely to be
 heard in the Senate Energy Committee on Tuesday next week.  He said the
 committee at this time is fairly neutral on the bill since he doesn't see
 that it does anything.  He understands our problems with the bill, but
 suggested we may want to recommend a solution.  IEP will be meeting with him
 this afternoon to give him the problem at the 50,000 foot level.  Individual
 companies may want to give him the specifics.
 
 Where are we with our meetings with members of the committee?
 
 IEP met with Kip in Sher's office who was noncommittal, but agreed with our
 arguments against the bill. IEP's meeting with Alarcon was cancelled.  We
 are trying to reschedule.  Since this is a special session bill, Dunn and
 Poochigian will be voting on the bill.
