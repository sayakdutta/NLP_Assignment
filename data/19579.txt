 
 We need to start figuring out as soon as possible:
 What we want to accomplish at the hearing.
 What our posture/message will be.
 What to expect from the judge/commissioner and if and how we want to respond.
 What to expect from others and if and how we want to be prepared to respond.
 How to coordinate with other parties prior to the prehearing conference.
 How to ensure we're well coordinated with our other efforts (e.g., PG&E bankruptcy and Edison negotiations)
 
 Sue and I can take the call from this end, and presumably Mike and Jeanne you can team up in a room on your end, so we can conference everyone in using our phones.  Please let me know if this works for everyone.  Thanks a bunch.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
