 Sharon,
 All the information is being gathered and should be on its way to you.  If 
 you do not receive it by Monday, please give me a call and I will collect and 
 hand walk it up to you.
 Thanks so much for the response.
 Sylvia

 Dear Sylvia: I would like to make sure that the terminology used to code 
 Terminations is consistent with the terms and provisions of the applicable 
 plans, e.g.,  stock plans and severance plans.  I would like to view the 
 appropriate SAP screens or you may send me the terminology.  Thanks.  Sharon

 Sharon, Kristi, & Michelle,
 I am currently involved in a task group that is reviewing processes for the 
 Transaction Processing Center, SAP go live on 7/1.  The processes involve all 
 aspects from hiring, transfers, position control and termination.  I wanted 
 to drop a line to check with you to see if there were any current reviews 
 that your group might be conducting at this time that would require updates 
 or changes to the current state processing.  We want to be sure to capture 
 all gaps (i.e.  specific terminology, forms, letters, contracts, etc.) are 
 documented and resolved before go live.
 
 We would greatly appreciate any feedback you could provide at this time.  
 Also, if you are aware of any other groups that might need to be contacted 
 that have a vested interest, we will gladly give them a call.
 
 Thanks so much,
 Sylvia
