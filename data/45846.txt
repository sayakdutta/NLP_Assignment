 I've been running around trying to determine whether we have a tax problems 
 with Amita doing what she's doing for the above companies, and I'm hearing 
 that you've already cleared that with tax.  Can you please confirm this for 
 me.

 These could take a few days (or more!).  They have to be circulated to the 
 directors of the Company for signature and timing will depend on their 
 availability for signature.  If Amita wants to start signing today, she can 
 go ahead and start signing now and I'll make her appointment effective as of 
 today.

 Hi Tana
 
 Thanks for quick response.
 
 I'm happy for the unanimous consents of the directors and the 
 attorneys-in-fact.  Please could you let me know when these have been signed 
 and are effective.
 
 Thanks for your help.
 
 Regards
