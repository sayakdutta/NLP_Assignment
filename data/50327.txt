 Good Morning, Vince!
 
 This is just a reminder that I will need some sort of technical article for 
 the newsletter by the morning of 10 Jul. (since we won't have an issue this 
 coming Monday).  I'd like to get a little earlier start and see if we can get 
 one or two pieces by then.  What do you think?
 
 By the way, I have Gwyn Koepke lined up as the "personality of the week" so 
 we're okay there.
 
 Best Regards,
 
 Sam
