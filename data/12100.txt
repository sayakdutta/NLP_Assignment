 Mr. C.  
 
 Attached is an environmental matrix to install EFM on the existing fuel run.  
 All work will be inside the Northern Natural Gas Kermit Compressor Station.  
 The only excavation required will be for a pole and conduit.  
 
 No asbestos will be disturbed.  No hydrotest water will be used.  
 
 Roger W. - Am sending you a copy of this so you can obtain any necessary ROW 
 permits.  Please give me a call at 505/627-9124 if you have any questions.
