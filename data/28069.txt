 I need you guys to jump back into your files on the Topock issue asap.  Tony, 
 I assume Lou briefed you on the situation.  I think the most recent liquids 
 sample had pcbs in excess of 50 ppm.  That is well in excess of the 
 contractual limit that I recall to be 1 ppm.  Our research a few months ago 
 was about options to force the interconnect back open above 250 mm/d if the 
 samples came back clean.  Now, the issue is, given dirty samples, what can we 
 do to keep PGE from slamming the interconnect shut.  We need to complete our 
 research/thinking immediately and have a spectrum of options ready to 
 discuss.  Seriously, I am reviewing with Lou the option of a preemptive shut 
 down of the interconnect, but that looks like an unwise strategy so far.  ALL 
 ideas are worth considering.  Frank, Steve, and Maria, anything in your 
 memory banks on TW or FERC jurisprudence that would prevent a Hinshaw from 
 refusing to schedule transport volumes through a point even if the Hinshaw 
 seemed to have clear contractual rights to refuse to schedule volumes based 
 on gas quality/contamination concerns?  I don't think TW's tariff has a 
 specific PCB spec.   DF
