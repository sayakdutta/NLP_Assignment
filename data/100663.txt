 
 Shelley, I can take a stab at pulling together TW-related information today 
 and will run it by Jeff to see whether he has anything to add.  I am leaving 
 on vacation Saturday and have a lot of other work to finish up here before I 
 go.  Therefore it might be best to bring in someone else from 
 legal/regulatory to pull up the info for El Paso, Kern, etc.

 With concerns about curtailments and force majuere events in California, 
 Steve Kean has asked for the preparation of study of all possible types of 
 disruptions (e.g. curtailment, diversion, penalties, etc,) in the gas chain 
 flowing to Calif and who bears the legal/financial liability for each event.  
 Specifically, he has asked if ETS can assemble a description of such 
 provisions for the pipes delivering to Calif.
 
 In particular, he wants a summary of following:
 
 Curtailment - When do pipelines curtail? 
 Curtailment compensation
 Imbalance Provisions
 Penalties/OFOs
 Allocations (For El Paso Only)
 
 Help!  Do you guys have any materials explaining these provisions?  Steve 
 wants this all pulled together by Friday.
