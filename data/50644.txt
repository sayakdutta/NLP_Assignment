 Dear Mr Kaminski
 
 I hope you have been well since we last spoke.  I shall give you call later 
 today but wanted to email you with an update on Energy In Europe as soon as 
 possible.  Unfortunately, the workshops and Summit Day on 19th June haven't 
 booked as well as we had expected and with a month left to go before the 
 Conference, have had to cancel them.  Many apologies for any inconvenience 
 this might cause to you and Prof. Geman - I wanted to tell you as soon as 
 possible so as to cause the least amount of disruption to travel arrangements 
 etc.  The main conference itself is booking fine and will continue as 
 expected, and I certainly hope you are still able to attend, albeit in a 
 spectator role.
 
 I have similarly emailed Prof. Geman and will follow up with a telephone call.
 
 Again, apologies for any inconvenience and I will call you later today to 
 discuss details.
 
 Kind Regards
 Alexandra
