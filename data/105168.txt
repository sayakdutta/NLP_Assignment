 Julian,
 
 let's leave it for Barclays to request the guarantee which they no doubt will.
 
 Treasa and David will need to discuss with the currency swaps desk in Houston 
 the issue of euro conversion.

 Barclays call on the guarantee. If they think about it then they probably
 will want the Corp. guarantee. And of course the precedent swap was
 guaranteed....we could send out the first draft though and see if they raise
 the issue of the guarantee. Do you want to raise the question of
 re-denomination into euro with them?
 
 


  
 
 
 
 Sara,
 
 I hope you have now received instructions from your commercial swaps team to
 put
 together an ISDA  currency swap and confirm which ECT Corp will be providing
 to
 either Enron Europe Power 3 Limited or a subsidiary of that company. The
 subsidiary will be receiving dollars under a bond issue and paying pounds
 out (a
 spot transaction I believe) but will then receive pounds income which it
 will
 need to convert to dollars to pay interest on the bonds.
 
 The precedent document is the Sutton Bridge currency swap.
 
 Can you please confirm you have been instructed and let us know your timing
 for
 issuing a document.  The sooner we can see this next week the better.
 
 The bond trustee will as usual require the swap to be backed with legal
 opinions
 from Enron in-house counsel (Mark Haedicke) re due execution and from V&E
 (Terry
 Yates) re enforceability. My understanding is that the swap will not be
 guaranteed by Corp (correct Julian?).
 
 Linklaters are representing Enron - Julian Davies and Fran Xavier (tel: 171
 456
 2000). Could you please send them your fax, telephone and email details.
 Linklaters have kindly agreed to prepare a first draft of the Mark Haedicke
 opinion and to send it out to you Sara.
 
 Thank  you. I look forward to hearing from you.
 
 
                          Mark
