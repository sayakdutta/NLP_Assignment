 Isabel and Greg:
 
 Attached is an escrow instruction letter authorizing you to hold the
 documents referenced in the memorandum in trust until the closing
 transaction.
 
 Jaap, you are authorized to fax the documents that you have to Isabel at 212
 277 4001 and to Greg at 203-359-3031.  As the funding is contingent on them
 seeing our fax documents first, we will have to send them now (or no later
 than 9 CST) or the funding doesn't occur.
 
 Call me if you have any questions.
 
 Kent

 This seems fine.  You might want to add the GE acknowledgement of receipt of
 funds, which, as we are holding documents in escrow until monies are
 received by GE, can also now be signed in advance.
 As to the opinion, we would prefer it to be executed by Dan Rowley or
 yourself, rather than by you per personam Dan Rowley.
 Let me know if this is possible
 Thanks
 Isabel

 Will this work?  Is this correct list of documents

 Can we not fax the document to Dan Rowley and ask him to fax it back to us?
 That way he doesn't need to print it out.  Alternatively, do you have
 authority to issue the opinion yourself?

 I trust both of you as attorneys to hold in escrow.  This is an
 administrative problem.  Dan Rowley cannot get to a printer in time.  Can I
 sign Dan Rowley name by Kent shoemaker and fax it out to you.

 That is fine but if you can also fax the documents to me at the same time at
 212 277 4001, that would be good.
 I agree with the Escrow Letter in principle - who would you want to sign
 such a letter? Presumably Salmon, as beneficiary of the guarantee?
 Thanks
 Isabel
 
 
     
 
 Greg Lang at Paul Hastings has requested that the fax documents be sent to
 him.  Is that okay?  I need to create an Escrow Letter that says the
 documents cannot be released until funding.  I don't want a guaranty out
 there without a closing.

 Our credit documentation provides that Pegasus shall not cause any monies to
 be released from the Turbine Escrow Account until all relevant documentation
 has been executed and delivered, namely:
 
 (i) GE consent 
 (ii) GE opinion
 (iii) Turbine Contract
 (iv) Security Agreement 
 (v) Promissory Note
 (vi) Amended Salmon LLC Agreement
 (vii) GE Parent Guarantee.
 
 The lenders consequently expect to see an executed (faxed if necessary) copy
 of all of the above (including the GE Parent Guarantee) prior to release of
 funds from the Escrow Account.
 
 Thank you 
 Isabel
 
 

  
 
 In conversations with GE, it is their understanding that their guaranty
 will not be transmitted until there is a fed ref number tomorrow.  The
 opinion letter will be faxed as soon as the GC is available, or Kent can
 sign for Dan Rowley if that is acceptable.  DRowley can sign originals on
 Thursday.
 
 The LOC is in the works, and GE understands that 10% will be retained in
 escrow until the LOC is delivered.
 
 There will be three original opinions.  There is one original guaranty, and
 I'm not certain of GE's willingness to give more than that.  Obviously,
 there will be only one LOC.
