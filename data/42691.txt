 This is fine with me.  Can you go ahead and do what is necessary here.
 
 Thanks, 
 
 Jeff

 Jeff,
 
 Genia is having problems with her laptop, and evidently it was never imaged 
 properly.  Our floor tech, Kien is going to reimage the machine, but we also 
 need to order an additional 128 megs of memory.  
 
 If this meets with your approval, please forward this message to Janette.  
 
 Thanks!
 
 (Janette, Genia is under GL #0413, CC #105657.)
