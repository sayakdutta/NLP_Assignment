 Thanks for your message. We are always looking for new employees
 with the right skills.
 
 Please, send me your resume and I shall determine what is the best
 way to arrange an interview. We can interview you in Sydney and then 
 bring you to Houston for another round of interviews.

 Dear Dr. Kaminski
 
 This is Quentin Kerr from Australia, I just came back from the Sydney's
 conference. Glen Dixon has told me that you are interested in my work. It is
 always my honor to work with you. I am currently a PhD student at the
 mathsmatics department of the university of Queensland (aiming to finish my
 thesis at the end of this year). My research interest is financial
 mathematics, in particular, energy market modeling and derivatives pricing.
 Now I send you copies of my first paper (submitted to the Applied
 mathematical finance) and my talk (the full version of the academic paper
 will be available in 2 weeks). Any comment will be appreciated.
 
 PS: attached with the talk at the conference.
 
 Best regard
 Quentin
