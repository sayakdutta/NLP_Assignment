 
 I appreciate your note and yes it has been awhile since we spoke.  I do chat 
 with Ray occasionally.  Steve without sounding abrupt I still have no 
 intention of doing business with your shop.  That situation was difficult  
 for several of us involved, and it is not something  that I believe I will 
 forget. nor understand.  
 
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Sandra
