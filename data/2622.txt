 oops enymex
 
  
     
 
 huh?
  
     
 how does nymex work?
 
  
     
 all I hear is that all the funds are going to get squeezed as soon as the nymex opens.  fuck, i don't know, but I'm not going get long crude hoping to squeeze the funds.  lost that game too many times.
 
  
     
 nice move--stats will be very very bullish---especially padd I and II--expect big draws.
