 Rosalee:  Could you please print out the following two documents for Mr. 
 Lay?  One is an excel sheet showing the summary of the results of our 
 analysis of the core/noncore market structure that Mr. Lay has been 
 discussing with leaders in California.  The other is a word document 
 explaining the summary table's contents.  If you have any questions, just let 
 me know.  Maureen, can you print out for Steve, too?  Thanks very much for 
 your help.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
