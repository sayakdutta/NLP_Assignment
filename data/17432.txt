 California's "GDP" the tech sector represents? 
 
 Best,

 I think it will be extra important to add "lost demand" from brownouts and 
 blackouts to consumption to get the real growth rate of power demand this 
 year.  There was an increment of this for 1999 given the problems in New York 
 City and Chicago and maybe elsewhere.

 Thank you very much for the tech data.  Margaret, is there data out there 
 regarding the California utilities performance (i.e., how many rolling 
 blackouts, etc. v. national average)?  Thanks again.
