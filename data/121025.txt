 
 Travis and Stacy,
 
 I just heard from the Hesco guys and they would like to set up a meeting or conference call to discuss the master and collateral assignment documents.  I think that they have some questions and comments.  Please let me know when you are available and  your preference, meeting or conference call, and I will set it up.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kim
