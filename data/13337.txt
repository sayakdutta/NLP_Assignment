 you, and be sure to let me know if you can use my help in the future.

 Michelle -
 
 It was grand to bump in to you last night at Randalls.  Your son looks like a 
 bundle of energy.  Your cookie insights were not lost on my daughter.
 She has secured my commitment to visit the bakery area first thing on our 
 next trip. I'd say she considers it a good encounter.
 
 Take care
 Steve
