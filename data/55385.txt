 Dear Vince,
 
 after getting our heads together here,
 we would much apprecaite if you could share the Research Group's latest on 
 --- 
 
 - Var ie "... repeat my workshop presentation on value-at-risk..."
  as well as cover additional topics viz.

 internally.
 - Discuss volatility modelling, and whether it is possible to maintain and 
 trade a term structure of volatility in electricity
 
 - Modelling forward curves with reference to associated markets (eg Oil). 
   Can we gain some insights through spreads to related market curves (spark).
 
 I assume your hotel is booked already. Catching the taxi is the best way to 
 get to your hotel.
 Since you are arriving on the weekend , if you need to contact me - my mobile 
 is 0417-692295, home tel/fax 
 is 9232-8892

 Paul, Raymond,
 
 Thanks for your message. 
 Sorry I did not get in touch  with you earlier. The last few weeks were very 
 hectic. I am starting 
 right now my preparations for the presentation I am going to give at the 
 conference.
 
 Here are the details of my itinerary (I shall send you a copy tomorrow). I 
 arrive Sunday morning
 and leave Saturday morning. The conference takes place on Monday and Tuesday. 
 On Wednesday, I am making a presentation at the workshop on value-at-risk. I 
 would
 like to stay at the conference for the duration: it's a great learning 
 opportunity for me.
 
 On Thursday and Friday, as well as in the evenings (except for the evening
 of July 18), I am at you disposal.
 I would like to take advantage of this trip and learn as much as I can
 about the Australian markets and discuss with you the research agenda.
 I shall be glad to make several presentation.
 I can repeat my workshop presentation on value-at-risk as well as cover 
 additional
 topics. 
 
 
 Vince

 I support Raymond's email and would welcome the opportunity to have you give 
 a presentation (formal or informal) to the trading group on latest research 
 initiatives in Houston.  Please let us know your schedule so that we do not 
 overly burden you during your visit.  Look forward to seeing you and catching 
 up over a beer.
 Thnx
 Paul

 Dear Vince,
 
 Hi !, it's only two weeks until the Aust Energy Risk (17-19 July ) seminar in 
 Sydney.
 Is RISK organising your hotel ?
 
 Otherwise, Kirsty can organise for you, 
 eg harbour vIew at the Regent or convenience to the seminar location at the 
 Sheraton ?
 
 We would like to make sure that you have all the necessary "comforts" of home 
 when you are with us,
 Elliott & David can set up a desk for you in the office/trading room with  
 phone etc 
 so you can use one of our PC to access email or plug in your laptop.
 Please let Elliott or David kmow your requirements.
 
 How long will you be with us ?
 Is this your first trip to Sydney ?
 There are several of us in the office who would like to take you  for a 
 meal(s)/ show you the sights etc and
 discuss the latest Research findings with you whilst you are in Sydney eg VAR.
 
 Hear from you soon.
 Raymond
