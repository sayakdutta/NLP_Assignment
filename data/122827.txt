 Thanks for the info.  I may need some help decoding the info so we can get 
 exact durations for warnings.  However, I think we should wait until we get a 
 genuine expression of interest from a counterparty before we spend any more 
 time on this.   It's definitely good that we have this data though should we 
 need it.   Pre-1963 is probably not necessary at this time.
 
 
 Thanks,
 
 Charlie
