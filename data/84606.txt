 The speaker presentations are now available at the Enron Law Conference 
 website at http://lawconference.corp.enron.com/. These materials can be found 
 under Presentation Handouts or the Conference Schedule. Click the icon to the 
 left of the presentation which will launch the application. Once the file is 
 visible, you can navigate to the various slides using the Page Up and Page 
 Down keys or print the file. To return to the Handouts Menu use the back 
 arrow. If you are not able to access the website from your location, please 
 contact me and the files can be sent via e-mail. These materials will be 
 available on the website until next year's conference. The CLE Committee 
 hopes you enjoyed your first "Binder Free" conference!
