 Dear Mr. Kaminski,
 
 The following are the  personal and work e-mail addresses of the Polish
 trainees in College Station.
 





 
 I would like to invite you to join us for a paintball game next Saturday,
 Feb 5th. The purpose of this event is to develop team building among our
 student members, Board of Advisors, and corporate clients.
 
 In addition, I would like to invite you to participate in our Mock
 Sales day on Saturday, Feb. 12th.  During this day, the new members will
 first receive training on AIESEC sales/knowledge and then role play with our
 Board of Advisors and alumni acting as company
 representatives. Sharing your AIESEC and work experience would be a
 valuable contribution to our training program.
 
 I will get in touch with you regarding these events in the beginning of
 next week, as soon as I have the time and place finalized.
 
 I appreciate your interest in working with us.
 
 Best regards,
 
 Biliana Pehlivanova
 Vice President of Incoming Exchange
 AIESEC Houston
