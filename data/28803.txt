 We won our motion yesterday to depose Conoco on the Rensvold documents 
 questions so it sounds like they will also depose Steve Gilbert about the 
 Imperial plant.  We're deposing the Enerfin rep today - hopefully we'll get 
 him to tie the terminated contracts to the wells that were under those 
 contracts (Conoco is now saying, "Well, how were they supposed to know what 
 wells were tied to what contracts" - duh) and possibly when Conoco took over 
 the accounting for the plant - we still haven't been able to locate an 
 invoice earlier than Jan. 1990.  Anyway, HOPE YOU FEEL BETTER SOON!!!!!  Try 
 a frozen margarita for a sore throat.  Works every time.
