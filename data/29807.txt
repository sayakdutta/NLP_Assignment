 
 Phillip:  the changes I would like to make are to promote Patti to Manager 
 whenever you feel the time is right, and then I am going to recommend Stacey 
 for promotion to Sr. Specialist based on her recent performances.  I also 
 would like to be able to use the bonus system this year to reward some of the 
 people who have been here the last couple of years.  It seems like we have to 
 keep paying outside people more and we don't get to reward the experienced 
 people who stick with us enough.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.
