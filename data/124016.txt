 Stacey-
 The PL Desk report was modified, so I tested it earlier today and everything looked good.  Can you please send an email to Bill Crooks and Karen Y Martin so they can release the new version to production.
 
 Thank you.

 JP,
 
 Please test version 3.0.2.1 of PLDesk that is in Stage.
 It shows the Category (cmdty, cpcty) that was missing before.
 
 Let us know if it works good.
 
 Thanks!

 Any luck with the PL Desk Report?

 JP,
 
 I got your message yesterday but I had to re-image my machine at that time.
 I will look into it shortly and let you know what's the situation.
 
 Thanks!

 Nikolay- 
 How did you get the column Deal Cat-Code to show up when you ran the PL Desk Report?  This was the column that separated the lines into Commodity and Capacity.  I don't see that column when I run this report.
