 		  		  California Crisis  
 
 I've still got considerable work to do, but wanted to make sure all had a 
 chance to review and comment well in advance of finalizing.  I'm giving a 
 talk at Exnet on Monday about California.  Attached is a draft of the 
 slides.  All comments welcome and appreciated.  I'm continuing to work on 
 it.  Thanks very much.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
