 
 John,
 
 Easter may not work for me because I shall most likely
 be visiting my son who goes to school in California (we were spending
 Easter together for the last three years).

 Hello from Texas,
 
 We are trying to set up our meeting date for the 2001 conference and have run 
 into a snag.  We cannot get our San Antonio hotel on the first weekend in 
 April (as last year).  However, we can get the hotel and make all our "fun" 
 arrangements for the second weekend in April.  However, this is Easter 
 weekend.  The good news is that the room rates are substantially lower 
 because it's a holiday.  However, we are concerned that holding the meeting 
 on this particular Friday-Saturday will interfere with family plans such that 
 some or many of you may not be able to attend.  
 
 My related question to you is this:
 
 Does holding the meeting on the second weekend in April (Easter weekend) pose 
 a problem for you?  Please give us your thoughts ASAP even if you think you 
 may not be able to attend this year's conference.  We need your opinion to 
 guide our decision.
 
 Thanks and I hope to see you all again next April (sometime)!
 
 John 
 
 p.s.  We are very fortunate to have Enron return as our corporate sponsor 
 again this year.
