 entitiy).  It is likely that ENA will continue to deal directly with ENA 
 (RMT) and that EI will handle the accounting internally.  I'll let you know 
 as soon as I can.  Sara

 Sara,
 
 Any news on Enron S.A.?  Are we to confirm our new Non-Deliverable forward 
 deals under the name Enron South America, or should we use Enron 
 International?  Our counterparty is Bruce Harris.  Also, are we putting a 
 master agreement in place--will it be dated September 1, 1999?  Please let me 
 know how we should handle these, as we have a few deals we need to confirm 
 for EI/ESA.  
 
 Thanks.
