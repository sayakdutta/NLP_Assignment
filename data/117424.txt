 
 As the office construction process continues, your offices will be among the 
 next to be demolished & reconstructed.  While the current timetable is not 
 firm, it looks like your moves will be scheduled sometime between the 5th to 
 the 13th of October (this means the move may take place during the ENA 
 offsite).  I just wanted to give you as much warning as possible so you could 
 begin the packing process.  Joya Davis will have details of your new (in some 
 cases temporary) office locations, can help with obtaining boxes and will 
 schedule the actual move.
