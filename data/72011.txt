 
 Leatha,
 
 I have a couple of questions.  Do your numbers assume $7500 down (in addition 
 to the tax etc), and is the term 36 months or 48?  Both time frames are 
 mentioned in your explanation.  
 
 Have we heard anything on the remarketing of my Lexus?  Does the cost include 
 the tax trade on the Lexus?
 
 Thanks for your help,
 
 Kay
 
 
 
 
 
 


   
  
 Kay,
 The dealership will not come down on the price
 for the gold and wood trim.  I have an aftermarket
 company that can do both for $550.00.  Here is
 a 36 month quote for the Cadillac including the
 gold and wood.  Please review and let me know if you
 have any questions.
 
 EQUITY LEASE FOR TERM OF 36 MONTHS
 
 $  39976.38   Cost of vehicle
     2498.52*Sales tax
      161.00*Registration
     7500.00*Cost reduction
 ------------
 $  39976.38   Delivered price
 ------------
 $    568.33   monthly depreciation
      187.81   Monthly lease charge
 ------------

 *to be billed on delivery
 
 Let me know what you think.

 Hi Leatha,
 
 Neil and I went to D Taylor and looked at an Escalade. We liked it,
 however, we want to price it with a couple of extra features.  I like the
 extra wood package, and Neil likes it with the gold trim package.  When we
 asked for a price, it added around $1700, which I thought was ridiculous.
 They offered to discount it by $200, which I again thought was ridiculous.
 When we priced these options at McGinniss, the price was less ($600 for the
 wood package instead of $995, for instance), and they offered to discount
 the options by a third.  So, we can get the deal done if they will get
 reasonable over these options.  The sales guy (Nathaniel) was going to
 "work on it".  The fellow you had told us to ask for wasn't in, by the way.
 
 I will be out of town on Monday, but Neil will be in, and will have my
 Lexus.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
