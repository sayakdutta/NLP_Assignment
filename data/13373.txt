 Attached here are the current draft of the disclosure schedules to be 
 attached to the Purchase and Sale Agreement with Bidder A.  I have also 
 attached the portion of the PSA that contains the reps and warranties to 
 which the schedules relate. Please review the following schedules against the 
 reps and warranties to which they relate and let me know if any changes or 
 updates need to be made.  
 
 Thanks.
