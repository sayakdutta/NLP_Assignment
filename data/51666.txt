 Hi all,
 Martin has kindly arranged the following presentation for us.  Come and enjoy 
 it. 
 
 Zimin, Alex
 
 Giuseppe Paleologo of Stanford and Enron Research Summer Intern fame will 
 present a talk on 
   IP Pricing 
 at 1pm in EB 46C2, Friday, March 9.
 
 Below is a description of the topic.
 
 Because of the bursty and intermittent nature of IP traffic, 
 "oversubscription" is possible.  
 In telephone or cell phone networks, selling more lines than the physical 
 capacity is 
 commonplace.  When too many users access the lines at 5pm, busy signals 
 result.  With service level agreements that call for damages to be paid when 
 capacity is unavailable, simple busy signals will not do.  An approach to 
 this 
 issue and thoughts on the trade off between oversubscription and liquidated 
 damages will be the focus of this interesting talk.
