 You know how Paige is about directions, etc.  Feel free to call her, though.
 
 I ate all vegetables for lunch, but then I had a third cookie.  
 
 Annie broke her arm again, and may have to have surgery.

 I guess you won't want any dinner tonight. That's ok, that means more
 chicken for me! You know, it's getting close to time for you to make your
 wonderful sausage and cheese balls...
 
 Does Paige want to pick him up and take him to Sharon's? She could drop him
 off and I could pick him up. It doesn't matter to me. Do you want me to call
 her?
 
 Love, Neil

 I forgot to pack Michael's speech/language notebook this am.  I did remind
 him that today is a Mary Lou day.  He wants Paige to pick him up, but I
 don't know how that could work.
 
 The cars are moving on the Pearce Elevated.  You are probably right - you
 could go quickest on 10 assuming no construction problems, as 610 may be
 crowded.  I wish I would have thought to drive in that way this am.
 
 It is Bosses Day, and there is so much food around here.  I'm on my second
 cookie, and I won't even mention the sausage balls and 7 layer dip.
 
 Love,
 
 Kay
