 Michelle -
 
 Just got off the phone with Jeanie and wanted to see what we needed to do regarding folks who had original contracts under co code 0413 and have now transferred to co code 1596 (this company code is called Wholesale EES).
 
 The following people transferred to 1596 effective 10/16.
 
 Rogers Herndon
 Narsimha Misra
 Berney Aucoin
 Edith Cross
 Oliver Jones
 
 Timothy Coffing has been in 1596 since 8/6/01 - previous was in 0985 (EES).
 
 Gordon Savage has been in 1596 since 8/1/01 - previous was in 0985 (EES).
 
 Dale Furrow was hired into 1596 on 9/24/01.
 
 Let me know if you thing that we need to do something for these folks - I think the concern is whether or not they can argue that their non-compete time started at the point they left ENA.
 
 Thanks!
 Amy
