 
 Chris,
 
 Attached is my new and (in my opionion) improved spreadsheet for the citizens deal.  As you can see, there are slight differences between my calculations and John Cogans. the main issue is as follows:
 
 1)Calculation of the spread - he is taking the greater of PG&E topock minus $.10 minus pipeline demand charges OR SJ + fuel.  This can create a negative spread value equal to pipeline commodity charges (which we are reimbursed for).  The results of all of this is mulitplied by $.085.  I am assuming that the floor for the spread is SJ, therefore, the spread = zero if it does turn out to be less than zero.
 
 I hope you have time to review - Once this is fixed you are done - just collecting money.  I am working with Darla and Ann to get the orig granted.
 
 thanks,
 
 Kim
