 Monday, so he will not be able to see your e-mail until then.

 Dear Mr. Lay:
              My name is James Partsch-Galvan. I am the Libertarian Candidate
 for Texas Rep. 147. I do not support this new Sports Arena Deal. I was on the
 winning side last year, and I am galvanizing to be be on the winning side
 this year.
 I find it very deporable that the Sports Authority cancelled its Board
 Meeting tomorrow. This is another dirty trick that the Sports Authority is
 making to make it harder for citizens to voice their opinions. This is one
 more reason for taxpayers to vote no for any taxpayer funds to fund a new
 arena that is not needed.
 Sincerely, James Partsch-Galvan
 Libertarian Candidate for Texas Rep. 147
