 >  TWAS THE NIGHT BEFORE THE ORANGE BOWL by Katy Shapard
 >
 >  Twas the night before the Orange Bowl
 >  And all through the land
 >  Not a Sooner was stirring
 >  Not even the band.
 >
 >  Heupel and Norman
 >  Both nestled in their beds
 >  With visions of a Championship
 >  Dancing in their heads.
 >
 >  I was just settling down
 >  For a short winter nap
 >  And reminiscing how October
 >  Put Sooners on the map.
 >
 >  When out on the field
 >  There arose such a ruckus
 >  There was Rocky Calmus
 >  Holding his Buckus.
 >
 >  Out of the door
 >  I ran like a deer
 >  Jumped up and down
 >  And let out a cheer.
 >
 >  And what do I see
 >  To my very own surprise
 >  The Sooner Schooner
 >  Had finally arrived.
 >
 >  With Stoops and Mangino
 >  Leading the reign
 >  They whistled and shouted
 >  And called them by name.
 >
 >  Now Thatcher, now Fagan
 >  Now Savage and Griffin
 >  On Marshall and Woolfolk
 >  On Litrell and Williams.
 >
 >  To the top of the scoreboard
 >  To the top of the polls
 >  Now catch the ball, run the ball
 >  Win the Orange Bowl!
 >
 >  As they rode out of sight
 >  With Sooner Magic in hand
 >  They chanted exuberantly
 >  WE'RE NO. 1 IN THE LAND!
 >
