 
 I've looked into whether we can terminate our Val Verde interconnect 
 agreement with Burlington, and have determined we may do so only if we take 
 the following steps:
 
 1.  Terminate the OBA by giving 30 days notice to Burlington.  Paragraph 13 
 of the 6/1/94 OBA with Burlington (as successor in interest to Meridian) 
 provides that either party may terminate the OBA "at the end of the primary 
 term, or thereafter by providing thirty (30) days prior written notice" to 
 Burlington.  (The one-month primary term ended June 30, 1994 and has since 
 gone month-to-month.)
 
 2.  On the effective termination date of the OBA, terminate the interconnect 
 agreement by giving 30 days notice to Burlington.    The 12/31/92 
 Interconnect Point Operating Agreement, Paragraph 6, provides that either 
 party may terminate on 180 prior notice after expiration of the primary 
 term.  This is of limited use to us since the primary term does not expire 
 until 12/31/02.  However, the paragraph also provides that the agreement "may 
 be terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days prior written notice in 
 the event the OBA between the parties is terminated."
 
 As we've already discussed, termination of the agreement is an extreme 
 measure from a customer relations standpoint and we probably need to weigh 
 our other options first.  Let me know if you have further questions.
