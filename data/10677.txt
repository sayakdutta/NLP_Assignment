 Unfortunately, the Check it Out Awards program has not been renewed.  If you have someone on your team you wish to reward for a significant accomplishment, please check with Lynn to discuss whether she should submit a Personal Achievement Award request.

 Rick, 
 
 The South team would like to nominate several people in ETS for the Check it out Awards. 
 
 We have three questions: 
 
         1. What is the procedure for completing an award 
         2.  Is their an amount limit per team? 
         3.  Is their an amount limit per individual? 
 
 
 Thanks 
 
 
 Robert
