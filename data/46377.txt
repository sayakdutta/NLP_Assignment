 current form of collateral annex attached to the ISDA Master Agreement we 
 have in place with an ISDA Credit Support Annex and Paragraph 13 thereto.  If 
 you have any questions or comments concerning the form please call me at 
 (713) 853-3399 or Sara Shackleton, Senior Counsel, at (713) 853-5620.  Tanya 
 Rohauer in our Credit Dept. can handle any credit questions you have.  Her 
 number is (713) 853-3263.  Thanks for your prompt attention to this.
