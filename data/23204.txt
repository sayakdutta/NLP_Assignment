 Dear All,
 
 With reference to Art 14.2 (11) of the Articles of Association the Management Board wishes to ask the Supervisory Board for written consent to assign the rights of ownership of motor vehicle Alfa Romeo (reg - RLE 400) to the insurers PZU to enable them to pay compensation to ENS for the theft of the vehicle. Should the vehicle now be found, the property rights to the vehicle will reside with PZU.
