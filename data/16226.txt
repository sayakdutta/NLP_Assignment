 
 I'm available.
 
 
 
 




   
 
  It looks like tomorrow, Wednesday 9/6, at 5:30 Eastern time/2:30 Pacific
 works for most people.  Any objection?
 
  I will send around an agenda by tomorrow morning which includes the
 progress of the GSPP alumni group to date.  I look forward to welcoming Carl 
 and
 Severin and speaking with all of you to nail down a list of speakers to begin
 contacting.

  P.S. Coincidentally, I would highly recommend Carl's recent book
 Information Rules as a new economy business strategy guide that even has some
 relevance in what often appears as the old economy backwaters of the electric
 industry.

 ps
 _sr_b_1_3/002-4543327-5556850.  The parallel of Carl and Severin's work to 
 place
 the popular mythologies of the electric industry and information economy into
 tried-and-true economic principles is interesting.  That, in combination with
 tried-and-true public policy methods will be a strong antidote to many of the
 current political proposals.
