 
 Vikas,
 
 Attached are excel files for the different subsidiaries.  Each file has a tab 
 for the swap position and the option position.  For the options I have added 
 an auto filter at the top of the file so you can sort by strike price.  I 
 apologize for the delay, but I was trying to drop the info into an 
 appropriate format.
 
 
 
 Thanks,
