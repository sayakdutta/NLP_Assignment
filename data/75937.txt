 
 Kathleen,
 
 I will initial and leave these in my office in a file folder with your name.  
 Carlos has my proxy on the consent.
 
 I'm also leaving you with a couple of original CA's for Fred.  He was going 
 to email them to the other side for comment, so HANG ON to the pages I signed.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
 
 
    
  
 Ignore earlier version, ECT no longer exists so there is a change in the 
 signature block to read ENA Corp. f/k/a ECT
 
 
 
 PS Michelle checked in her voicemails and shot me back a positive one in 
 response to the one that I left on Tuesday (ie, there's interest and we need 
 to find the right fit.)
