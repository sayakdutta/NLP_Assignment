 I yalked to Aram. I have him on my calendar from 8:30 till 10:00 on Friday.
 A dinner / lunch on Fri would work for me.

 Vince,
 
 I asked my assistant to schedule the meetings with Aram and she will 
 contacting your asst..  As far as lunch or diner, I would be interested.  I 
 will visit with Aram in the next few days or if you do, you might want to ask 
 him.  I believe he is coming for a wedding and he might have a tight schedule 
 but lets ask.  Hope all is going well.  JGM
