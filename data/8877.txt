 
 If HR can not find this signed review, can Clara communicate with someone in 
 your group in Houston to be able to access a copy of the review by 11:00 am 
 on Friday?  That is the deadline for the final tally on completed reviews 
 (defined strictly by HR as their having received - and retained, I guess - 
 the signed review).  The goal is 100% completion by then, for reporting in 
 the ENA Office of the Chair staff meeting on Friday afternoon.  Although many 
 employees are now not under the ENA umbrella, we are tracking the completion 
 of reviews by their operating company assignment at the mid-year PRC time.  
 Thanks.  
 
 Of course, I believe you said that this guy left the company, and if that is 
 the case we may be alright without the review.  But getting a second copy 
 from Clara would probably be the best bet.  Thanks. 
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
    
 Hector, 
 DeMarco Carter's mid-year was completed and turned in with the others, per 
 Clara.
 
 I you still can not find, Clara can make a copy for you next Tuesday when she 
 returns from the London office.
