 Chris,
 
 The last two days the consumption at the plant has been 42,085 MMBtu and 38,852 MMBtu. These are plant reads based on 7am-7am timeframe. Do we need to sell an additional 5,000 MMBtu in order to pull more off of Lonestar??

 OK, Kathy and Troy have pointed out how bad my previous email was.  I'm sure I was thinking about lunch.
 
 Sabra Dinari scheduled the gas on Lone Start.  She quit on Friday.  I will be doing the scheduling until further notice.  Kathy Kelly will be my backup when I'm out.

 Sold 10,000 dth of Conger to TXU  for 4/23 at $3.37
 
 Our scheduler, Sabra Dinari, quit on Friday so I will be handling the noms for awhile and Kathy Kelly will.  I think its easier for me to do the noms on this since I'm selling point specific gas and we are not putting this activity in Sitar/Unify.
 
 Theresa, looks like I will be the one addressing the accounting questions.

 Sold TXU 10,000 dth at $3.17 for Thur 4/18/02.  I checked on the price with Darren Farmer at AEP and he said that's where Waha was trading so I don't feel like we are being taken advantage of too much.
