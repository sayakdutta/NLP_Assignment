 
 I will draft a letter to Wildhorse concerning the pressure situation.  We 
 have previously sent a demand letter on Sept. 29 for pressure data for the 3 
 year period, with no response from Wildhorse.  We need to reinforce the 
 curtailment that the high pressure is causing the resultant loss of profits.  
 I will circulate the letter for review by the group before sending.

 Joan, Gerald, Mark,
 
 We do not physically flow our gas into Questar. This means that our
 production is being curtailed (through increased pressure) for economic
 benefit to Wildhorse (at Crescendo's expense) of moving more gas from the
 Natural Buttes area south through the San Arroyo area.

 Due to the Mesa Tap compressor being down at the interconnect between
 Wildhorse and Questar, the pressure is backing up on Wildhorse.  These
 Crescendo wells are very sensitive to pressure, thus current production is
 around 2,500 mcf/d [2,675 mmbtud/].  Our first of the month nom was 2,800
 mcf/d [3,000 mmbtu/d].
 
 I am not sure if you want to reduce the nom now or wait a bit.  My gut feel
 is to keep the nom as is and get these higher prices - assuming prices will
 come down later this month.  let me know what you think is best.
 
 thanks
 joan
