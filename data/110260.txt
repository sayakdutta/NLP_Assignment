 
 Joe said he found me in the morning face down on the couch in my clothes with the cat snuggling up with me.
 
  
     
 that's amazing....i hit his door at least 10 times w/ Murphy's toy....i'm guessing he'd had a few cocktails too....
 
 btw...shame on your for trying to get me to go in there as a joke....i almost did, until i remembered i'm not in college anymore and this guy works at my company...course that all came to me in a flash as i was turning the door knob.
 
 you were doing a little nodding off yourself....that couch was a trap
 
  
     
 get this......he didn't even wake up!  He had no idea that you were there and couldn't figure out how Murphy got out of his room.
 
  
     
 i sustained injuries from friday night....two minor scratches on my index finger due to the cat, and a sore neck from head banging to limp bizkit....think mo suffered from the neck injury as well....hope your roomie wasn't irritated by the ruckus.
