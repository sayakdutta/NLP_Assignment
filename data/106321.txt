 I never heard back from you regarding my email of 4/18/01.  I had asked if 
 you would mind revising the forms of certificate which we will attach to each 
 trade confirmation.
 
 We would appreciate revisions to the April 12, 2001 certificates.  This will 
 be the format for all future transactions.
 
 Please send revisions to Kimberly Hundl.  Her phone number is (713) 853-1647 
 and fax if (713) 646-2443.
 
 Thanks.

 I am suggesting a minor change to the "Power Risk Management Committee" 
 certificate (to eliminate the reference to the Exhibit "A").  If we leave the 
 reference in the certificate, you will always have to label the confirm as 
 Exhibit "A" and resend the completed papers to us.  Please let me know if you 
 are alright with this change.  If so, we ask that you please resend the 
 certificate dated April 12, 2001.  If you do not wish to make the change, 
 please resend the two certificates to which the confirmation labeled Exhibit 
 "A" is attached.
 
 Please call if you have any questions.  Thanks.

 Thanks, Sara.  No problem making the changes.

 Attached are my comments to the certificates.  We will need to attach the
 form of confirmation to be certain that each particular transaction is
 authorized.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.
