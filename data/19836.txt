 Good news!  Wallace decided last night that we don't have to do a write-up for project after all.  All we have to do is turn in the presentation and the spreadsheet.  I've written her an email, telling her that we followed directions closely on the presentation (i.e., very simply, no jargon, spreadsheets, lots of technical crap, etc.) and wanted to make sure that that would acceptably when we turn it in, or  if she expected some "beefing up."
 
 I plant to spend a little time with my slides and the spreadsheet (though not much!), just to make a bit better.  I'll let you know how she responds.
 
 Great job by all.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
