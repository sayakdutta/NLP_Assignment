 Mr. Del Vecchio,
 ?
 We have received materials concerning the pension plan for non-union  
 employees at Celgar. The company's latest actuarial report disclosed that as 
 of  January 1, 2000:
 ?
 1. The going-concern liabilities exceeded the actuarial value of assets  by? 
 C$1,922,342; and
 ?
 2.? The solvency liabilities exceeds the market value of plan assets  by? 
 C$1,805,819.
 ?
 We have also received the full text of the plan and its amendments.
 ?
 Will you be reviewing these matters internally or shall we retain a local  
 actuarial firm to perform the due diligence?
