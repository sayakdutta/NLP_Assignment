 I am so glad you got internet service at home!  Earthlink is good.
 
 Have a wonderful time in Florida, I liked it bunches when I went.  Things are strange here, Dave is still very upset but is starting to trend toward anger now. He wants me to take the truck because he sees it as a betrayal that I got it for him a couple of months ago.  OK. I have a truck now and he has the car.  Wanna buy a truck?  He is also not wanting to be at home, which is fine with me. It is so tense and weird right now that I am glad to have the house to myself.  I don't really want to be there either.
 
 I have been keeping busy with friends, they have been so good to me during this. I went to a Seattle Seahawks game yesterday at the University Stadium, and thought about those trips up there to sit with you all during Scotty's surgeries. Seattle was nice, but it was a long day and horrbile horrible rain. Our seats were in the upper stadium away from the wind so we were dry. I have a movie Tomorrow and a party Wednesday. Tonight is just being home catching up on my laundry and my sleep.
 
 I love you very much! Thanks for keeping me in your heart.
