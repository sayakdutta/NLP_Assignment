 Jason Sherman has determined that Genia FitzGerald needs a new printer.  Her 
 printer has been repaired twice and does not work now.  I have located a 
 printer on IT Central for Genia.  The information is as follows:
 
  Hardware: Black/white personal printer HP 1100XI
  Description: 8ppm monochrome personal laser printer at 600 x 600 dpi
  Price:  $420.00
 
 Thank you,
