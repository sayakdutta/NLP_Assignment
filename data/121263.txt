 
 Mr. Dossett,
 
 I did not have your email address - however, I do recall inviting you verbally to the party, in person.  No one else on that distribution list received such an honor.  I am sorry you can't make it, as I know you have a black tie affair, however, there have been 12 girls who have accepted our invitation and only 3 guys.  Therefore, my party might have a better ratio for you.  Sorry you'll miss it!
 
 And I have TN and 18 for a smoothie.  Think I'll win?

 John Schilke emailed the invitation to me for the TN/FL game; however, I did
 not get the invite from you, meanie.
 
 I do hope you guys have a good time (I can't go to Houston this weekend),
 and I hope the Vols can keep it close for more than 5 minutes.  Did you see
 that the point spread is already up to 18?
 
 Write me.
 
 Kane
