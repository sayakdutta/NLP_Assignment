 Good for you.  I haven't bought my camera yet.  I probably will do it this
 weekend.  I got a coupon for 10% off this weekend at Best Buy.  I am looking
 at an cannon either the elph s200 or a s10 (I think those are the right
 numbers)

 Jerry and I bought motorcycles.  I LIKE!
 
 Are you still looking at getting a camera - an ELPH??  Is that a digital?
