 
 Hee Jung,
 
 Thanks. Do you have your resume by any chance?
 I could keep it on file for future reference.

 Dear Dr. Kaminski,
 
 My name is Hee Jung Sim who is working with Dr. Deng.
 At first, I thank you so much for your listening to my poor
 presentation.
 During the presentation, you gave me so valuable comments.
 Based on your advice, I am separating my work: 1) modeling the
 fundamental underlying (such as the internet usage) and 2) valuing
 telecommunication service contracts from the point of view of maximizing
 the profit of a capacity
 owner/broker.
 Though I understand you are so busy, I would like to keep contacting
 with you.
 Again, I appreciate your time and comments.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Hee Jung Sim
