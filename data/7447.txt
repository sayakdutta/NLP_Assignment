 
 I met with Karen Marshall today.  She is in the Community Relations group and 
 is organizing the dinner on September 7th.  I suggested that she add to the 
 invitation list the other interviewers this year for the scholarships (Roger 
 Ondreko and Gene Humphrey), Brent Price and Loftis Fitzwater (one of last 
 year's scholarhip recepients who started with us as an Associate this 
 summer).  I have also volunteered to coordinate with the University on 
 appropriate attendees, as some of Karen's info is dated and she does not know 
 people at the school. I will keep you posted.  --Sally
