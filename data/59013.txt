 Rick,
 As the press seems to be turning worse, I would strongly advise Enron to call George Sard of Citigate Sard Verbinnen at (212) 687-8080.  George is probably the leading crisis communications advisor in the world and could offer them great counsel, especially in distributing and managing the current press release.  We've worked with him and would recommend him without reservation.
 Hope that's helpful.
 Kristin
