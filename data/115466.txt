 Prebon and found he had done this deal without even knowing it! So he entered 
 it - Deal #461171.
 
 Thanks a lot for your patience, Stephanie.

 Prebon is sending a new confirmation with Constellation as the counterparty. 
 Broker mistake.

 Hello
 I have a question, should the Counterparty on this trade be Peco Energy?

 Tom Alonso's name is on bro confirm (Peco) but deal 459243.01 is under Mark 
 Fischer (COnstellation)
 
 Thanks
