 
 Pat,
 
 Hello!  I am sending to you a memo from Stuart Zisman here at Enron.  He has 
 a question that I am forwarding to you, since I don't know the answer.  Would 
 you please give him an answer today, if possible?
 
 Thanks a lot!
 
 Michelle

 Attached is a memo relating to the E2 transaction.  Please review the memo
 and respond as soon as possible.  We need to receive all feedback promptly
 as we expect to revise and post the revised Purchase & Sale Agreement by the
 end of business today (Monday).  Thanks in advance.
 
 Stuart
 
 Jinsung, please forward this to Don Miller ASAP.
