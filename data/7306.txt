 others), so I do look for golfers from time to time.  I will keep your number 
 handy!

 Sally, I really appreciate being able to play on your behalf in the 
 tournament yesterday.  It was a very nice course and we had a great time.  
 It's always nice to interact with your peers outside of work.  If you ever 
 need an extra player again ... my clubs are in the car.
 
 Thanks again.
 
 Dave
