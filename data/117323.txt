 I'm just a lawyer and as such still operating pretty much in the stone age.  
 The easiest way for me to look at something that is primarily text (minimal 
 graphics involved) is to have it in a form I can just print out.  If it 
 exists as a Word document that would be great.  I have not yet actually been 
 able to see the phase 2 site.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Mark

 I am the writer that is developing the online help guide for the EnronOnIine 
 system.  I work for Dave Forster.  Dave wanted to make sure that you have an 
 opportunity to review the online help guide before we go live.  My 
 understanding is that you have access to the test web.  The work in progress 
 help guide is on the website but is by no means a finished product; it 
 changes as screens and labels change.  Are you currently reviewing the online 
 help or do I need to advise you when it is considered final?  Please let me 
 know if you have a preferred way of reviewing this sort of thing. Thanks,
 
 Laura J
