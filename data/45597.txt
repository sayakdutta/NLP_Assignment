 trade financial unless we have a LEGAL reason not to trade with them.  With 
 both those counterparties, you are correct, it is the companies' intention 
 and direction that we trade financial with those entities, but still for 
 online I have to say "yes" unless I have a "legal" reason to say "no".

 Tana,
 We were reviewing the attached list and had a few questions on the 
 Counterparty Names:
 
 Aquilla Energy Marketing Corporation  .....We are trading financial deals 
 with them under the name Utilicorp United Inc. 
 Coral Power LLC    .....We are using Coral Energy Holding L.P. (this is the 
 entity with whom we have the Master Agreement) 
 
 Let me know what you think on these two...

 Per the request of Stephanie Sever, I am attaching a list responding to her 
 request to confirm the attached counterparties ability to trade financial 
 power products online.  Stephanie, the ones I said "OK to open" you will need 
 to go in and open for financial power (from Legal only).
 
 Call me if you have any questions about specific counterparties.
