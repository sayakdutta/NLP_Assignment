 Make sense for me to attend the meeting?

 I got a voicemail fro Ken.  He would be happy to meet with Freeman.  He is 
 willing to work on other times, but suggested the following
 After 3:00 on May 2nd (right after Ken's speech to the RGA) or late the day 
 before or in the morning of the second (to do this though he would have to 
 cancel his speech to the Texas Governor's business council but he is willing 
 to do this if necessary)
 His least preferred alternative in this general time frame would be early 
 morning on the third.
 Jeff -- could you coordinate with Rosie to get the time and place nailed down?
