 As you know, our next meeting is set for January 23, 2002.  Denise and Fran
 have major conflicts and cannot attend on this date. If there is anyone else
 who cannot make the date, please let me know.
 
 The output from the sub groups will be the key agenda items along with a
 discussion on marketing.  Some of you have sent in responses which is
 terrifically appreciated. (Have received input from Bob Peebler, Fran Keeth,
 Denise Huggins, Tim Tipton)  As expected, the input is quite good and
 important direction for us.  We would hope to get as much feedback as
 possible before the meeting.
 
 For those of you who have not yet responded, we would be happy to meet with
 you or your designates at your office after the first of the year if you
 would prefer an open dialogue.  Obviously, if you would still prefer to
 respond to the e-mail questionnaires that would be great.
 
 Again, we very much appreciate your participation on the Energy Committee.
 
 Happy Holidays to All
 
 Lane Sloan
