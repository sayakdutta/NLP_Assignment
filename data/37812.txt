 "Here is the announcement: Reliant Energy Weather Risk Management Group has developed
 Weather-sensitive Gas Load Indices ("WGLI"),  indices that measure national
 or regional residential and commercial gas consumption during the heating
 season. We believe the indices will provide valuable information for gas
 traders as well as other market participants.  We plan to make a swap
 market in the indices in the near future. We hope the WGLI swaps will
 become a new financial tool to help you or your clients to better manage
 their risks associated with the fluctuation of gas demand."
