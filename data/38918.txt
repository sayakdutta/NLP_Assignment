 
 I was planning on going down relatively early on Saturday morning with Sul 
 and Sheffler.  I would like to leave around 9:00 and go down and have 
 breakfast and a few beers at the peacock as a good friend of mine owns it now 
 and I would like to see him and what he has done to the place.  You are more 
 than welcome to come with us if you like.
