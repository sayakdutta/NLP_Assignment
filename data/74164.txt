 
 I can call you when I get out of my meeting, but it might be awhile.  Or, it 
 might be 600.  Dunno.
 
 
 
 


   
  
 I just left a vm for Carrie explaining what I would like to do. I will leave
 you a vm as to the outcome. Sushi sounds good to me. NM
 
 
     
 
 
 Sounds fine to me.  I would suggest new sushi place if I knew when we would
 be getting out.
 
 I haven't heard from Carrie Burton.  I'm on the phone.  If you would like
 to call her, St. Francis number is 713 782 0481.

 Just let me know before 5 and I will pick it up.
 My day? I feel like I lost control of Loss Control about 9am. Is it a full
 moon?
 Think you will feel like steak after your meeting with the big guys or
 would
 you prefer something else?
 
 
 
     
 
 Carrie Burton (works for Sallie Ellis) left a message that it would be a
 good idea for us to pick up a packet today.  I was hoping that it would be
 ready so I could pick it up a lunch, but it wasn't.  If I hear from her I
 will ask how late someone can pick it up, or maybe they can leave it at the
 Children's Center since they don't close until 600.
 
 How is your day?
 
 I have a 500 meeting with the big boys.
 
 Love,
 
 Kay
