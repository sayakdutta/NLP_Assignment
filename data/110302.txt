 Everythings pretty normal around here.  Anyway, I just wanted to say thank you for the shirts.  I think they're great.

 Hey there!
 
 How are you doing?  How is work?  I am keeping very
 busy here at school.  I know I am ready for a
 vacation, how about you?  How is the new place?  I am
 still trying to get organized- what a pain!!!!
 
 I just wanted to say hi!  I'll be talking with you
 soon!
 
 Love- Christine
