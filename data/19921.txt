 FYI. Sac Bee did a very big story recounting its version of how CA's electric market got upside down.  Cites Enron scheduling a large block of power over a "small" tx line as an indicator.  Also cites the dinner Davis had with generators leading up to the crisis, where, the paper says, the generators warned him, but Davis took the money and did nothing.
 
 Best,
