 
 The Master Sale Spot  with Southern Union Company is still active on our 
 system and thus has not been terminated.   Because this is old paper, we can 
 replace  same with a new Master Sale Spot terminate it,  issue a newer 
 version or prepare a GISB.    Does Southern no longer wish to trade under the 
 Spot? .
 
 Let me know how you want to trade (i.e. short or long term, firm etc. and I 
 will prepare the agreement.  I need the exact name of the company and a 
 contact, phone number.
