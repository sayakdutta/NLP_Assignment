 that for keen analysis?
 
 It would seem to me that if we end up with breakout contracts signed by E 
 Next, we should use the break out form, plus an override letter.  What do you 
 think?

 Last time I talked with Lee he was anxious to get the break out contract 
 signed.  Your plan works fine as long as we can wait to sign the breakout 
 contract.

 Here's a general description of the steps:
 
 Letter agreement signed
 Final form of break out presented to purchaser (not executed by Enron LLC)
 $ deposited in escrow
 TurboPark notice given
 
 Closing date:
 
 TurboPark closing docs signed (bill of sale, assignment & assumption)
 LLC signs breakout contract
 Amended LLC, other closing docs executed
 Money released from escrow to Enron
 Enron pays off TurboPark
 
 This is how it worked on the Intergen deal.  I was unsure from your email if 
 you see a problem with this process.

 Sounds like a plan, but do not sign a breakout contract in an Enron entity 
 until you hear further.
