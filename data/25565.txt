 Heidi, yes let's check the rates on the transport usage tickets.  Daren, is 
 supportive of this decision.  Thanks, Mary

 The rates are in the system correctly in Unify (so that we can invoice 
 correctly), but Daren's group uses a Sitara deal (the transport usage 
 tickets) to estimate desk transport in the P&L during the month.  Right now 
 we have not entered in or corrected rates in their transport usage tickets.  
 Our group has not taken that step, since we have been most concerned with 
 settling the G/L (after the month is over).  By not having the right rates on 
 the transport usage tickets, the risk is that the P&L will be off during the 
 month.  Would we change process and let Daren set up the transport usage 
 ticket and then have us enter the rate?  If so, we would need to change the 
 process with his group to put us in the process so that we can enter the 
 correct rate.  Please let me know what you want to do.

 Heidi, we need to ensure the rates are correct on all meters (HPLC/ENA for 
 Texas) and that the rates are in the right system.

 FYI...the economics group publishes this report every month to show how much 
 the marketing desk spent in transport.  They can get their expense numbers 
 either from their estimate (from CPR) or from Unify, where we put the rates 
 in.
 
 One potential enhancement would be that in addition to managing rates for the 
 transport capacity tickets, we set up the rates for the transport usage 
 tickets.  I am going through the transport usage tickets for February right 
 now (as part of the market meter study) and I see some rates I don't tie back 
 to Lauri's matrix.  For example, Lauri's matrix shows 0.05 from Thompsonville 
 to HSC, but the transport usage ticket (updated by Daren's group) has 0.055.  
 This means the economic estimate can be off.  Let me know what you want to do 
 with this.
