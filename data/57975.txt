 Here is the e-mail I discussed in my voice mail to you this morning.  Please 
 let me know whom I should deal with in the Governmental Affairs organization 
 about this.  Thanks.

 Enron Energy Services Operations, Inc. (EESO) is being asked to sign an 
 affidavit in connection with a bid to the City of Chicago (the bid is in the 
 name of Enron Building Services, Inc.).  Among the items in the affidavit is 
 a statement disclosing whether EESO or Enron Building Services (and 
 presumably any other Enron entity) has had a business relationship with a 
 Chicago city elected official in the previous 12 months.  "Business 
 relationship" is defined broadly to include business dealings with the 
 official, his or her spouse or entities in which the official has a financial 
 interest which entitles the official to payment of $2,500 or more in any 
 calendar year.  There are also certain exceptions that apply.
 
 We are required to sign and submit the Affidavit this week, so if you are 
 aware of any transactions that might require disclosure in the above 
 Affidavit, please contact me by the end of the day today.  I apologize for 
 the urgent nature of this request.
 
 Thank you,
 David Roland
