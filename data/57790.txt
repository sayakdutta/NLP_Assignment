 Here is an initial draft from our attorneys in California on the state 
 processes that could be required.  In my experience, the single biggest issue 
 the utilities have is the transfer of the rights of way -- there are 
 thousands of these -- each like an individual contract.  If the state tried 
 eminent domain, it seems like it could face a long-time in the courts to 
 finish that process.
