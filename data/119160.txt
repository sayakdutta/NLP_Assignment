 
 II made my pledge some time ago so am concerned to hear my name is on the list.  I'll try again.
 
  
     
 I'm the EWS Legal United Way campaign coordinator this year, so I've been asked to contact those in our department who have not yet participated in the United Way process. I'm starting with those at the AGC (or higher) level.  If you are receiving this email, you are on the non-participant list as of 930 this am.
 
 You can participate by going to https://hrglobal.enron.com, and use your global id (begins with a 9, not the "P" number). You can also email or call Eric Thode and tell him what you want to do, and he can handle it for you.  It is possible to participate (i.e., access the site) but not make a contribution, if that is your preference. It will at least help our sagging participation percentage.
 
 I have to admit that I thought I had participated in the contribution process before today, but learned that my effort to participate had failed.  Therefore, you may have also attempted to submit your contribution, but you are showing up as a non-participant at this point.  You will know you're contribution has been registered when you receive a confirming email.  
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
