 
 Hello Ivonne,
 
 I do not have an insurance card for the vision health plan. Can you tell me what I need to do to before I go to a doctor? Also should I find my own doctor or is there a list of names provided. Can you clarify this to me or tell me who do I need to contact for this?
 
 thanks,
 Monika Causholli
