 Dear Parents of 8th Grade Students,
 
 I am now emailing you as the Social Justice teacher (my second hat).
 Currently, your daughter is not taking Social Justice. Since I would not
 be seeing you (as a Religion teacher) during Open House, I wanted to
 provide you with my handout and classroom procedure sheet. I'm also
 attaching information about the major project.

 <<Current Event Project.doc>> 
 :-)
 Mrs. Ward
