 
 On January 13, 2000, FERC issued a Section 7(c) certificate for 
 Transwestern's Gallup Expansion.  The Commission's order contained two 
 conditions:  1) that Transwestern file its discounted rates within 15 days of 
 the order, and 2) that Transwestern restructure its relationship with Enron 
 Compression Services so that Transwestern will have sufficient operation 
 control over the motor at the Gallup compressor station to assume regulatory 
 responsibility for the motor's operation, and that Transwestern file a report 
 with the Commission stating how it complied with this condition.  
 Transwestern accepted the  certificate January 14, 2000 but reserved the 
 right to seek rehearing or clarification of the order.  On January 18, 2000, 
 Transwestern filed a motion for extension of time to comply with the 
 condition that Transwestern file its discounted rates.  Transwestern has 
 already filed with the Commission the discounted rates it will charge its 
 expansion shippers, subject to a request for confidentiality.   Transwestern 
 intends to file a request for rehearing of the January 13 order explaining 
 why the Commission erred in ordering Transwestern to publicly disclose its 
 discounted rates in advance of the normal time for making such disclosure 
 through a discount report.
