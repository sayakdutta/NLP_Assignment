 Dear Member of CAM Board of Trustees,
 
 You may recall that several weeks ago we surveyed the Board members to 
 determine preferences regarding Board meeting times. We did this because we 
 have had several discussions with members who have great difficulty with the 
 4 pm or 4:30 pm meeting time.
 
 Since the Board appears to be fairly evenly split between a noon meeting time 
 and a late afternoon meeting time (10 definitely prefer Noon; 10 definitely 
 prefer late afternoon; and 20 have no strong preference), we have decided to 
 try alternating the meetings.
 
 Therefore, our next full board meeting, which is currently scheduled for 
 Monday, January 22 at 4 pm, will instead take place Monday, January 22 at 
 NOON (March meeting will take place at 4 pm).
 
 Please note this change on your calendar and advise Cheryl Blissitte by 
 email, phone (713.284.8253) or fax (713.284.8275), whether or not you will be 
 attending. This is especially important as we will order sandwiches for this 
 Noon meeting.
 
 Thanks.
 
 Marti
