 
 Do you have volumes and rates info to go with the NNG current estimate and the 2002 plan?    If not you, can you get for me?
 
  
     
 I am not aware of the volume/rate info you used - is this pulled in from another schedule?
 
 
 Kevin,
 
 Do you have the volume and rate information on Northern Natural that will
 tie to Rod's forecast as well?
