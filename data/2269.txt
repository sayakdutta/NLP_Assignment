 I am pleased to inform you that one of Canada's leading business service
 providers, Grant Thornton LLP, is now offering US firms a full Site Location
 Advisory Service.
 
 With over forty offices across Canada, Grant Thornton LLP knows Canada.  We
 are finding that more and more US corporations are looking north as they are
 faced with fewer satisfactory location alternatives in which to expand.
 Canada, with its relatively large and well trained work force, not to
 mention lower operating costs, is increasingly being considered by companies
 such as yours.
 
 Grant Thornton LLP would be pleased to discuss this service with you.  It is
 a full service that includes, on your behalf, real estate sourcing, labor
 force analysis and verification, tax analysis and comparison, and incentive
 negotiations.
 
 Should you be considering expanding your operations and interested in
 discussing our service, please give us a call.  More and more United States
 firms, from call centers to manufacturers are locating in Canada to serve
 both their US and Canadian customers.
 
 Based in Moncton, New Brunswick Canada, I can be reached at:
 
  Telephone     (506) 857-0100
  Cell Phone    (506) 381-1450
