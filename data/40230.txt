 DJ FERC Affirms It Lacks Jurisdiction In Pwr Facility Sales

 WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission 
 Wednesday reaffirmed its policy finding that it lacks jurisdiction over 
 generation facility transfers.
 
      The Federal Power Act requires the commission to approve jurisdictional 
 asset transfers greater than $50,000 in value. But FERC doesn't view 
 generation assets as jurisdictional.
 
      FERC often rules on generation asset transfers, but only in the context 
 of associated transmission assets and power sales connected with the 
 generation assets. FERC regulates electricity sales, but not the plants that 
 produce the power.
 
      With divestiture of generation assets becoming increasingly common in 
 the $215 billion U.S. electricity sector, this policy has increasingly been 
 questioned by consumer interests and others.
 
      Most recently, the American Public Power Association and Citizen Power 
 Inc., a utility watchdog group, petitioned the commission to reconsider its 
 view that generation asset transfers, absent associated transmission 
 facilities and power sales agreements, don't fall under FERC jurisdiction.
 
      At issue were generation asset sales by Duquesne Light Co. (DQZ), and 
 FirstEnergy Corp.'s (FE) transfer of power plant ownership from its utility 
 operating units to FirstEnergy's competitive services unit.
 
      The commission was unpersuaded by arguments of APPA and Citizens Power 
 that state regulation is inadequate to protect the public interest and 
 promote competition in the restructuring electric utility industry.
 
      "There is no necessary nexus between the interstate transmission or sale 
 of electric energy, on the one hand, (the triggering events giving rise to 
 our jurisdiction) and the disposition of a generation facility by itself," 
 FERC said.
 
      "Not only does the statutory text support our interpretation, but there 
 is no precedent, legislative history, or case law which would support a 
 contrary conclusion," FERC said, denying the petition.
 
      FERC cited section 203(a) of the Federal Power Act as conferring 
 authority to regulate the disposition of "facilities subject to the 
 jurisdiction of the commission." FERC has never asserted jurisdiction over 
 generation assets, and has traditionally left that to state utility 
 regulators.
