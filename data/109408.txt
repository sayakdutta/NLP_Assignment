 Jeff received your e-mail and asked me to respond on his behalf as he is 
 traveling.  He would really enjoy having lunch with you on your next visit to 
 Houston.  Please give him a call when your plans are firm...he can be reached 
 at 713.853.6894.
 
 Jeff also inquired as to what you are up to these days.  When you have a 
 minute, please drop him another line.

 Jeff, I don't know if you have heard, but WA won the state basketball 
 tournement last weekend.? I have ordered the Beacon News for last Sunday and 
 would be happy to make copies and send to you.? Kerkman is still the head 
 coach in his 24th year.? The point guard on the team is John Fowler.? John's 
 dad is Herman Fowler who played in 71.
 
 Hope all is going great for you.? I know the opening of Enron Field is 
 keeping you busy as well as running Enron. 
 
 I need to come to Houston soon.? Would there be a time I could run by and say 
 hi or buy you a sandwich for lunch? 
 
 Hope to hear from you. 
 
 Mike Buttrey
