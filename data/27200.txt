 we were parking 50 mw's with COB.   We sold 50 to Reliant/HLP,  but the transmission got cut.    3 mw's flowed on Oasis 9337 to Reliant.    We show in the system that we are purchasing 50 mw's from COB and selling them 47.
 So,  I dont think that we needed to bookout 3 mw's with HLP.    They received 3 mw's from City of Bryan on deal #625291. 
 You entered a bookout purchase on deal #625352.
 
 Oasis also  shows that 3 mw's flowed on #9337.   So once again,  we have an extra purchase from HLP that we didnt need.
 Did you negotiate this with HLP?   
 Is this what happened?
 
 I'll talk to you about this tonight.
 
 Thanks,  MW
