 Sorry to hear that you have yet not successfully off loaded your duties of
 as unofficial secretary of the group.
 
 Andy, not me, will be the Enron representative on the Steering Committee.  I
 had subbed at a meeting 10 or so days ago because Richard Sanders had been
 tied up on an extended project.  Andy will handle it from this point
 forward.
 
 I will ask Andy to copy you on the information that he sends to Tom
 Nicholas.
 
 Hope you have a nice holiday.
 
 
     
 
 Charles -
 
 Did you mean that you also wanted to participate on the Wright Steering
 Committee ?  Our approach has been that only in-house counsel will
 participate;  it is only in the event that an in-house attorney is unable to
 participate on the committee that outside counsel has been proxied in.
 Please advise.
 
 Could you also have Andy  information.  As the secretary (of sorts) of the Steering Committee, I have
 been maintaining updated information for the groupl.
