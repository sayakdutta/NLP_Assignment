 Are we going to have some quality problems with this gas?  EDG
 
 



  
 Well- I have officially NOT heard from Hilcorp after numerous voice and email 
 messages.  Please plan to have the gas rerouted back down the valley line for 
 the Dec 1 forward.  Call if you have any questions-

 Thanks for the info.  I appreciated the call the other day.  It really helps 
 me out to recieve info early like that.

 According to Gary Hanks, we would like to have the gas on the valley line 
 anyway

 I can not believe you are sending emails form Hawaii!!!!  You are crazy.  I 
 took care of Camden for the month-
 It is now 330 and Hilcorp has not responded.  I spoke with Jerry Bubert 
 several times today- emailed Mike LAnnou and left messages, and had him 
 paged, and copied Hildebrand (the president).  If we don't hear by 4pm, we 
 are supposed to bypass the gas...........
