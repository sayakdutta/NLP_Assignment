 Annissa, thanks for the quick response.  I have one more request - will you please break-out the remaining balance of $16,263,807 into the amounts that should be apportioned to Virginia, Rhode Island and Massachusetts.  Also, there is interest income of $778,649 reported on 34F.  Is this amount included in the $2,535,155 related to Ft. Hamilton?  If not, please provide me the break-out between states for the interest income as well.
 
 Thanks!
 Chad

 Chad/Clint,
 
 The amount of $18,798,962.61 given to you by Mark Adauto was incorrect.  It consisted of our 'entire 34F ledger' revenue + interest income.  The correct total is $2,535,155.40 which is all Ft. Hamilton in Long Island, NY.
 
 Should you have any additional questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
 
 Thanks,
 
 AG

 Anissa, we are trying to prepare the 2000 New York Franchise tax return for Enron Federal Solutions, Inc.  In order to complete this return, we need the sales in the state of New York apportioned to either the cities or counties that this income was derived in.  For 2000, there was a total of $18,798,963 of sales and interest income apportioned to the whole state of New York.  This is the amount we that we need broken out into cities or counties.  Clint and I have been requesting this information from you for several weeks now.  We need this by Friday, August 17 to timely file this return.  Please contact me with any questions.
 
 Thank you
 Chad
