 Haven't seen you two in awhile!
 
 ENA is considering a financial deal with an offshore entity located in 
 Panama.  We have no research for this jurisdiction.  I will need to hire 
 local counsel and send a deriviatives questionnaire for response.  Have you 
 used Panamanian counsel before?  Please send info.
