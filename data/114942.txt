 
 Matt Motley and Mike Swerzbin both said this trade should be desk-to-desk and 
 has nothing to do with Bonneville. Could you send me a copy of the confirm 
 letter? They'd like to look at it to try and figure out what trade BPA is 
 referring to. If it's a hard copy, you can fax it to 503-464-3740. Thanks a 
 lot.

 Hey Kate! I have a trade that Motley did and it shows as a desk to desk 
 trade. But BPA sent me a confirmation on the trade. Is this suppose to be 
 desk to desk or should the counterparty actually be BPA?
 
 Thanks,
