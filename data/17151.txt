  RE: Legislative Status Report Week Ending 2/23
 
 
 RECENT EVENTS:
 
 -- The week started off on a very positive note.  Monday was a holiday!
 Tuesday, however, inevitably came along to spoil all the fun with last
 minute committee hearing announcements for some significant bills.
 
 -- SB 39x (Speier) was heard this week in the Senate Energy Committee.  Thi=
 s
 measure would define owners or operators of any electric generating facilit=
 y
 as a public utility subject to the state=01,s jurisdiction.  The bill also
 places the CPUC in the role of determining scheduled maintenance outages fo=
 r
 generation units.  Although the bill goes much further, the author=01,s onl=
 y
 intention is to give the CPUC a role in coordinating power plant outages,
 but seems to not understand the implications of doing it in the manner
 outlined in the bill.  IEP opposed the bill and testified to that end along
 with CMTA, the State Chamber of Commerce, Enron, WSPA, and the California
 Cogeneration Council.  The usual cast of consumer groups supported the bill=
 .
 Of particular note during the hearing was the hostility shown to the
 opposition by the Chair of the Committee, Senator Bowen.  The message from
 the opposition clearly was ignored by the majority of the members as it
 passed out of the committee on a party-line vote.  IEP is currently
 reassessing its strategy on this particular issue because this is not the
 only bill that proposes similar changes.
 
 -- The Assembly Natural Resources Committee, chaired by Asm. Howard Wayne,
 was scheduled this week to hear two siting bills.  The first was AB 34x (La
 Suer), which would make various changes to the CEC siting process, includin=
 g
 some IEP-sponsored language.  IEP has a support if amended position on the
 bill which has some technical and policy problems, but workable.  Last
 minute amendments offered by Asm. Keeley forced Asm. La Suer to postpone a
 hearing on the bill until next Monday (2/26).  However, because the Keeley
 amendments basically gut the current language and turn it into a study bill=
 ,
 La Suer is unlikely to accept them and, according to the negative committee
 analysis, the committee is unlikely to approve the measure in its current
 form.
 
 AB 36x (Wright), on the other hand, passed the Natural Resources committee
 with only one =01&no=018 vote.  AB 36x would provide expedited siting for a
 repower project, as defined.  However, despite IEP=01,s efforts to get the =
 bill
 amended, the current language would help few, if any, repower projects.  Th=
 e
 author has agreed to continue working with us, the environmental community
 and the CEC to develop language that works for everyone.  IEP=01,s major is=
 sue
 at this point is that is should actually work.  The measure was double
 referred to the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee and will b=
 e
 heard there next.
 
 -- The negotiated language on the QF issue finally has a vehicle, SB 47x
 (Battin).  All stakeholders are not united in their complete support for th=
 e
 measure.  IEP has may need some additional changes but will be mobilizing
 members on Monday to educate Senators on the bill and support the measure i=
 n
 the Senate Energy Committee when it is scheduled for a hearing.  Both SCE
 and WSPA also have some outstanding issues, but only WSPA so far will be
 opposing the bill.
 
 -- SB 6x (Burton), which would establish and state power and financing
 authority, passed off the Senate Floor 24 to 14 this week and is headed to
 the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee next. IEP met with
 Senator Burton=01,s staff this week to talk about amendments to SB 6x relat=
 ing
 to limiting the Authority=01,s eminent domain powers.  Staff was open to wh=
 at
 we had to say but we have little confidence our recommendations will move
 forward with the bill.  Regardless, IEP will continue to push for amendment=
 s
 on the Assembly side.
 
 -- SB 33x (Burton), which would require the Governor=01,s plan to purchase =
 the
 IOU=01,s transmission to be approved first by the Legislature, is still
 awaiting consideration on the Senate floor.
 
 -- The Governor had another press conference today to provide a status on
 the negotiations between the state and the three IOUs regarding the purchas=
 e
 of the utilities=01, transmission system.  Reuters is saying there the Gove=
 rnor
 has a deal with SCE to purchase its share of the power grid for $2.76
 billion.  Negotiations are still going on with PG&E and SDG&E.  More
 information on press conference can be found on the Governor=01,s web site.
 
 --  Attached is the most recent legislative tracking report which includes
 all the special session bills introduced through yesterday.  Please let me
 know if you need copies of any of these bills.
