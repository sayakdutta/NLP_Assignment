 
 When I travel for more than one day, I usually take my computer and use it on 
 the road.
 
 Hope you are enjoying this perfect weather!
 
 Love,

 Hi,Kay Kay. Dad  and I just want you to know how proud we are of you. Looks
 like you may have snow in New York. Stay warm. Is it O. K. for me to email
 you there? We are going for a walk. Love you,Mother
