 Bryan -
 
 I have a meeting scheduled with Mark on Monday at 4:00 to update him on the 
 status of a number of item associated with our Department's technology 
 plans.  I had hoped to update him on the status of the intraweb site; 
 however, since no one from your group has contacted me to follow-up on our 
 Sept. 29 meeting, I was wondering if you would be available to attend the 
 meeting I have with Mark.  If so, I would hope that we could discuss issues 
 pertinent to moving the process along as our goal is to have a functioning 
 web site as soon as possible.  
 
 Please let me know your availability and when I can expect some movement on 
 this project.
 
 Thanks.
