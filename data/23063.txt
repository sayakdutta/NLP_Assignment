 
 Kate, I've just returned to Houston from a lengthy stay in London and found your message.  I have no objection to including any information that is pertinent to the firms' conflcits checks.  As to yoga, I do intend to try it as soon as my travel schedule permits.  All the best. Jim 
 
  
     
 
 Jim - It's been suggested to me that we should include more information than just the list of all active entities that is currently distributed to the major Houston law firms (your list of contacts).  It's suggested that we should include (i) dba's, (ii) historical entities to include mergers and dissolutions, and (iii) name changes.  Please advise how you wish me to proceed and I'll look at packaging the information in the most compact manner although it's going to be bulky.  
 
 Have you tried the yoga in the Body Shop yet?
 
 Best regards Kate
