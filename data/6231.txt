 
 Just as clarification - we start 6 players and have weekly scoring in haed to 
 head matchups.  You can chage your lineup before each day's worth of action.  
 Your sixth man can be any position.  The draft order will be determind at 
 10:30.

 And by the way plove, it is last day for everyone.  You can take 1 minute out 
 of every half hour today to make a pick.  Everyone else has agreed.  Besides 
 it won't be as much fun without my whipping boy again.
