 Dear Mrs. Beck,
 
 Thank you very much for the invitation.
 I'm excited to tour Enron field because even though I am from Houston, I have
 yet to attend an Astro's game.  I look forward to attending, and I thank you
 for supporting our Energy Management program at OU.
 
 Sincerly,
 Heather Pinkerton
