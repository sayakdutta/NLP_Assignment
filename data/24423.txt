 Just thought I'd send a quick note to keep in touch and let you know what
 I've been up to.  This is a picture from one of my first assignments in
 March of last year during spring break in Panama City Fl.  The nice young
 lady in the picture is, along with all of the other "competitors", wearing a
 BIGWORDS T-Shirt.  Wilson, I'll defer to Grump for a joke.
 
 My next assignment is the national cheerleading championships in Orlando Fl
 in two weeks.
 
 Hope everything is going well for you guys,
 Talk to you later.

  Hey T
 Thought you might get a kick out of this one.  Looks like your fellas over
 at Big Words are doing a great job with their grass roots marketing
 campaigns.
