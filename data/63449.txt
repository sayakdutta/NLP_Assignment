 Thank you, Rosalee.  I will be forwarding to you Monday, a briefing package 
 that will provide Mr. Lay with background on the proposed transaction, the 
 client and client representatives.   Please let Lety Smith, who is my 
 administrative support (ext 36562) know if Mr. Lay will need it sooner.   
 Lety will page me in the field to make alternative arrangements.

 We have confirmed a meeting to introduce you to Tom Young, EVP (and member, 
 O-I Board of Directors) and members of his management team at O-I 
 Headquarters next Tuesday, 8/15 at 11:30 am.  We have 90 minutes, Mr. Young 
 will be hosting us to lunch during our meeting.  Joe Lemieux, CEO, is 
 unavailable only because his calendar just didn't match up with your near 
 term available dates.  My strong bias is that the sooner we have an 
 opportunity to connect at the top the better, especially given our drive to 
 close in Q-3.
 
 In addition to coordinating logistics, I will get briefing packets to your 
 offices Monday describing the proposed transaction, deal related issues 
 (details are not likely to come up during the meeting), key O-I personnel 
 bios, and general information about O-I and its current business, including 
 summary outside financial analysis.
 
 Regards,
 Michael
