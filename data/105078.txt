 me at 713/853-5620.
 
 We'll e-mail two identical Schedules to you in word.  Enron Capital & Trade 
 Resources entered into an ISDA with Barclays in 1995 and that Schedule was 
 virtually identical to the one we're sending.  We therefore do not expect 
 there to be many issues.  The banks should serve as Calculation Agents and 
 confirming agents so we will look to them for the confirmations.  Look 
 forward to finalizing these documents with you.  Thanks.  Sara
