 ABSTRACT:
  Fundamental properties of conditional value-at-risk, as a
  measure of risk with significant advantages over value-at-risk,
  are derived for loss distributions in finance that can involve
  discreetness. Such distributions are of particular importance in
  applications because of the prevalence of models based on
  scenarios and finite sampling. Conditional value-at-risk is able
  to quantify dangers beyond value-at-risk, and moreover it is
  coherent. It provides optimization shortcuts which, through
  linear programming techniques, make practical many large-scale
  calculations that could otherwise be out of reach. The numerical
  efficiency and stability of such calculations, shown in several
  case studies, are illustrated further with an example of index
  tracking.
 
  Keywords: Value-at-risk, conditional value-at-risk, mean
  shortfall, coherent risk measures, risk sampling, scenarios,
  hedging, index tracking, portfolio optimization, risk management
