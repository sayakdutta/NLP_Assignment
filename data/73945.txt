 I thought you might ask me that!  NCNG could make the request, but we would
 have a good argument that it doesnt have the same need to know as the Public
 Staff and Attorney General (which both represent "the Public") and that the
 potential for misuse of proprietary information is much greater and harder
 to circumscribe.  I tend to think NCNG would not ask.  Based on the limited
 statement of interest in their petition to intervene, it's hard for me to
 see what they could justify asking for.  Also, they always have to be
 careful, because more often than not, they are going to be on the receiving
 end of data requests.  They can't argue that they're entitled to obtain
 certain information if they ever want to argue that they don't have to
 disclose the same thing.
 
 
     
 
 
 Can the gas company also make the same requests?
 
 
 
 
 
 

 



 
  
 The NC Attorney General asserts a statutory right to intervene which I
 think
 misreads the statute but which the Commission has always allowed.  The AG
 routinely intervenes.  I suspect that in this case they are interested in
 the possibility of bypass and the merchant plant issue.  I will call Len
 Green today to find out.  The AG can make the same discovery requests that
 the Public Staff makes, subject, as was the case with the Public Staff, to
 the execution of a confidentiality agreement.
 
 



  
 
 Hi Allyson,
 
 What is your impression of why the NC attorney general's office has
 intervened in the CPCN proceeding?  Is this typical?  Does the AG's office
 (or any other intervenor) have any special rights to discover any of the
 confidential information we file?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
