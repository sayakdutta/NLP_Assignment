 
 Thanks.  Looks like one thing good has happened for them today.  I don't 
 think Maviglio will be able to stay.  Your thoughts?  I'm glad he made some 
 money off of Enron stock.  (What a jerk.)
 
 Also, we did file the amended complaint yesterday and the motion to quash 
 will be filed today.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Jeff,
 
 Following up on yesterday's conversation, SBX1 31 did contain some expedited
 review provisions for CPUC and DWR decisions and was chaptered into law on
 May 10.  The first special session ended on or about May 15 which means the
 expedited provisions take effect on or about August 15.  The intent of the
 budget language was to have that take effect even sooner.
