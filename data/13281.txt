 
 I'd suggest finding otu more information.  My inclination would be not to 
 accept the contractor.

 Michelle - Welcome back from vacation!
 
 Gary Buck suggested that I approach you for guidance regarding a background 
 investigation report we have received on a contractor candidate for 
 Networks.  The report indicates that 8/14/95, the candidate was found guilty 
 of theft, a misdemeanor.  He was sentenced to 3 days jail and fined $200.  
 The candidate indicated on his Contractor Information Sheet that he had a 
 misdemeanor from 1995.  
 
 Should we have the recruiter contact the candidate and ask for more 
 information about the misdemeanor, or should we simply reject him?
 
 Thanks for your assistance.
 
 Candace
