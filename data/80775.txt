 Fred has not had much luck with getting attention with this.  This sounds 
 like it should be in your (new) group.  Please give Fred a call, I think this 
 sounds very interesting and is worth a follow-up.

 Hello Louise:
 
 I recently authored a white paper, giving some background on the air cargo 
 business for Enron Net Works.  In the paper, I identified the hurdles we 
 would need to overcome in order to create a market for trading air cargo 
 capacity futures, none of which were deemed insurmountable.  I further 
 suggested that Enron could approach this business by leveraging EOL to act as 
 a non vessel owning common carrier, trading physical capacity while readying 
 the market (and ourselves!) for financial trading.
 
 I am very interested in moving this business idea along here within Net 
 Works.  I have some ideas regarding likely industry partners that could move 
 us along rather quickly.  I think the logical next step may be to get with 
 you or with someone on your staff to begin some dialog with the eventual goal 
 of creating a business plan.  Any thoughts?
 
 Thanks!
