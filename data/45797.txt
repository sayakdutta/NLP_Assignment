 
 In order to improve communication between the Legal Department and our Online 
 team, Mark Haedicke has asked us to prepare a list of legal contacts which we 
 will be providing to the Online team.  Before we send this out, I have been 
 asked to send the list to each of you for your input.  Please let me or 
 Leslie Hansen know of any additional contacts or changes that you feel we 
 need to make to the list.
