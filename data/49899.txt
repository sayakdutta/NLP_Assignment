 
 Chris,
 
 My part has not changed for some time (since early July).
 
 I sent  the last vintage of corrections  to you when I was in Sydney.
 You can send the version you consider final to us just to double check.
 
 I took the liberty of sending our chapter to Darrell Duffie and he liked it.
 What is more important he did not find any error.
 
 
 I shell send you my comments on the article for Robin in a day or so.

 Hi Vince,
 ?
 How are things with you? Well I hope. Do you have  the latest version of your 
 part of chapter 3? (I think GRant has sent thru a  seperate, updated version 
 to you, which has been typeset). Everything else has  been tied up and we 
 will go with the version we have, unless we hear  otherwise.
 ?
 Many thanks and best regards.
 ?
 Chris.
