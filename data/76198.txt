 Thanks for sending this the Barbara and Peggy.  Hopefully it will result in 
 Peggy's getting the relief she needs.

 Barbara and Peggy,
 
 I understand that we may be looking for someone to provide some assistance on 
 the Mexico transactions, and that Carlos Sole may be interviewing for the 
 position.  Carlos and I worked together on multiple transactions in Mexico 
 while I was with EECC.  In fact, I hired Carlos to work with me because 90% 
 of what I was doing was in  Mexico, and Carlos has a good background in 
 transactional work in Mexico. He assumed "first chair" responsibility for all 
 the Mexico work when I left EECC. Carlos is bilingual in Spanish, and he 
 conducts business in Spanish quite comfortably.  He is a very bright, a hard 
 worker, and a lot of fun to work with.  I personally think he would be an 
 excellent addition to our group.
 
 Please let me know if I can provide any more information about Carlos.  
 
 Kay
