 However, it is supposed to be a beautiful evening, so we can have some adult 
 time on the back patio.
 
 I put a couple of steaks in the fridge.
 
 Love,

 You should have said something. I could have waited for Michael to finish
 eating and taken him to school.
 Would you like to go out tonight? Sounds like we can at least meet somewhere
 after work. Let me know. Love, Neil

 Hi.  I'm at home, trying to waiting to visit GE's offices which are at 610
 and 290.
 
 Michael has been invited to have pizza with Stephen this evening.  Tommy
 and Julie are going out, and Stephen has a sitter (Sam won't be there), so
 he wanted to have a buddy over for pizza.  I told Julie that Michael's
 calendar is open for this evening.  Hope that is ok for you.
