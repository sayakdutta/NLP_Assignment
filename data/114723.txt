 
 You have beef-cakes up there? Are they single?
 
 
























































  
  
 There are some Las Vegas Delight True Beef Steak tomatoes available by Jody's 
 desk.
 
 I wouldn't recommend taking ANY of them, as I'm sure they don't taste very 
 good. (Yeah, right!) 
 
 Tomatoes are available in limited quantity, so come and get it!
 
 *NOTE* If you get a tomato that is somewhat green, that means it's probably 
 not good. You can put it on my desk and I'll take care of it. =o) 
 OR, you can keep it on your counter for a day or two and it'll be ripe and 
 ready to go! (I recommend doing the first thing...)
