 commitment from EOTT, thus changing their organization, without taking on the 
 price risk.  
 
 On the hiring, I think that is a good idea.  If it is put in a way that due 
 to the extensive growth that we expect to have, you want to be in the hiring 
 loop, I don't see how people can object.  It is not a trust situation but an 
 additional reference point.  We are here to help.

 I think that meeting with Stan was good.  I'll push Nowlan, Schroeder, etc.
 
 On another note, I want to send out an email to the business unit heads about 
 hiring.  Obviously crucial to our business growth is more talent, I'm just 
 worried we could be bringing in people on the trading side that do not 
 upgrade our group.  After we feel more comfortable, and I feel good our 
 assessment of talent, I'd loosen the reigns substantially.  This is driven by 
 the crude and products group primarily.  Any thoughts?
