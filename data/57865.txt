 number; it is: 415.765.8408.  As you'll recall, you asked for a California 
 energy expert.  Mike certainly qualifies.

 Steve,
 
 Appreciate the call this morning. It is good to learn from an expert that 
 shares the same type of market-driven approach to policy in energy as we do 
 in broadband deployment. We are not energy experts, but will do our best to 
 get up to speed and take more active role in long-term solution.
 
 I will keep all of these documents confidential, but would like to use some 
 of the data points  to create an action plan from high-tech that we can 
 share with others such as HP, Intel, Novell, Solectron, National 
 Semiconductor and others that have engaged in this issue. Let's discuss 
 tomorrow afternoon. As I mentioned, we (Silicon Valley cos.) have meetings 
 in the morning and evening on 2/15 with Gov. Davis and will be discussing 
 energy crisis.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Laura
