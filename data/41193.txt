 
 Yes.  I do have a meeting at 10 this morning, but should be out around 11.  Just let me know.
 
 
  
     
 
 
   Marie,
 
   I have your fruit - we probably need to meet somewhere to do the transfer.  There are too many boxes to carry.  I gave Jane her fruit last Friday and we met in the parking lot on Dallas - across from the Allen Center Met Parking Garage.  I'll send you an invoice.
 
   I am not sure if the decorative center is open today - if so, do you want to go?
