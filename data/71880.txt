 
 Thanks.  I'm in DC (actually, Richmond VA) with Nancy Wodka working on a 
 PPA.  I haven't opened the attachment yet due to the length of time it takes 
 over this connection, and the late hour.
 
 You may have addressed this in your email, but as I recall you were going to 
 work on a summary of the restricted activities, as a foundation for the 
 document anticipated by the LLC agreement.  Any luck with that?
 
 I'll be in touch shortly.  Thanks for keeping track.
 
 Kay
