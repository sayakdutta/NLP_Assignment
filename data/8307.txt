 Dear Sally,
 
 Thank you for agreeing to review my resume and qualifications for a position
 at Enron.  Your company has a fine reputation for innovation and growth.
 I will call you Tuesday afternoon concerning any questions we both may have
 and to arrange an interview if we deem it is appropriate at that time.
 I appreciate you consideration and look forward to meeting you.
 
 Sincerely,
 Matt Moses
