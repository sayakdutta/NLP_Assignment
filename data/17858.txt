 
 My apologies.  Just been "ordered" to be on a 1 PM (PDT) call.  Possible to 
 do our call at 2:30 Houston time.  Sorry about that.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 I think we said we'd call you at 3:00 p.m. CDT.   See 'ya then.
 
  
     
 Hmm. Interesting.  Thanks for the info.  Do we know who got to Breathitt?  
 Forgive me, but what time did we pick to talk today?  And will you call me?
 
 Best,
 Jeff
