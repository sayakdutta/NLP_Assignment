 
 Just a note, you know, we more or less made the same changes to the 
 Industrial Master that we made to the ISDA.  If you are using that form at 
 all you should update it to include our changes.  I think Paul mentioned in 
 his presentation at the seminar that you were using the Industrial as the 
 basis form for Norway.  Anyway, if that is the case, we may need to look at 
 that form.
 
 See, you're always in my thoughts!  Missed you at the seminar.  I hope we'll 
 see you at one of these soon!
