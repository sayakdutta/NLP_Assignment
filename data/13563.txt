 Sally Alvarez, Charla Stuart, Karen Moore and Mark Wilson have been working 
 on the development of concepts for the new Enron daycare center scheduled to 
 open the fall of 2001.  They have developed 3-5 alternatives and will be 
 holding open forum type focus groups on:
 
 December 11th and 12th in room EB49C3 from 11 am to 1 pm.
 
 
 If your schedule allows we would love to have you stop by and provide your 
 feedback.  In addition, if you know of employees within your companies that 
 would like to provide input please extend the offer to them.  
 
 Our Wellness group is also working with Karen Moore to develop potential new 
 names for the Body Shop.  If they are ready by the 11th, we will also solicit 
 input on these as well.
 
 Thanks in advance for your help
