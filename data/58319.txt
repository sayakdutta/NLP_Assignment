 
  I am recommending Linda Robertson (currently Assistant Secretary for the 
 Department of the Treasury) for the position Vice President and General 
 Manager of Federal Government Affairs.  Linda would head our Washington, D.C. 
 office, replacing Joe Hillings who will be retiring early next year.
 
  Linda has interviewed with Ken Lay, Tom White, Mike McConnell and Jeff 
 Shankman, who join me in this recommendation.
 
  Attached are biographical information on Linda and a National Journal 
 article identifying Linda among the "Washington 100".
 
  We have conducted extensive reference checks on Linda.  Included among those 
 was Secretary Summers who said:
 
 "Nobody I know has the determination she has to get objectives met."
 "Far more capacity to grasp the details than anyone I've seen."
 
  On Monday, I will seek Executive Committee approval to extend the offer to 
 Linda.
