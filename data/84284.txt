 
 My Dearest Barbara,   
 
 I long for the time when I can gaze into your lovely golden brown eyes and 
 lose myself in your innate beauty.  The sheer black leather rockies revealing 
 your strong athletic form tonight will be a wonderful memory upon which I can 
 call upon to see me through any of life's most challenging obstacles.  
 Sigh!!!!!!!
 
 I plan on leaving for the magical journey tonight as soon as humanly 
 possible.  For who can think of work when one so lovely as Barbara awaits.  I 
 can take journey upon my green Camry steed to pluck the lovely young Ms. 
 Waldrop from those two known as Steve and Gina, and we will abound on towards 
 fate.  Perchance it might be best for Barbara to come seek me out, as I am 
 adrift without direction to the place where Steve and Gina reside.
 
 Yours truly,
 Gerald

 Where is my "heartfelt and meaningful" e-mail?  I have been waiting all day!
 
 So, what time are you planning on leaving work?  I am leaving here at 5:30
 and heading over to Steve and Gina's to change and walk their dog.  I have
 already taken Sophie over there.  That way I don't have to go home and then
 come back all the way over here.  Do you want to come over to Steve and
 Gina's or do you want me to come by and pick you up?
 
 Hope you are having a good day.  Talk with you soon!
