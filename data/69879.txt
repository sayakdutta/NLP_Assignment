 up with it.

 I snooped around and found out that Ann Elizabeth White is the author (I 
 don't know her, but she is with Barbara Grey's group).  I really think we 
 should revise portions of it.  Do you want my input?  I am making some 
 handwritten changes to talk to you about.

 This was sent to me by one of the developers.  I believe it relates to an 
 expansion (or new interconnection) of the Caledonia facility.  I don't know 
 which lawyer has been working on it, so I'm sending it around to see if 
 anyone claims it. Chris thought that someone from Power Trading may have been 
 working on it.

 Kay,
 
 This is the format for the land options that Robert Shaw of New Century is 
 using in Caledonia, MS.  Please advise if these documents are appropriate.
 
 Thanks,
