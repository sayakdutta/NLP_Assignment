 
 David,
 
 Derrick approved the use of Charlie Caulkin.
 
 Also, here is info on the Denver lawyer who should review the issues relating to the sharing of employees.  Do you want to call him, or would you like me to?
 
 Good to see you this week.

 I will alert him that you will be sending him something.  He is the managing
 shareholder of that office and he either will do it or assign it to one of
 his partners.
 
 Thanks for thinking of us.  Any word on the Mariner Energy people?

 Kerry,
 
 We have a need to have a proposal/concept reviewed by Colorado lawyers.
 Which lawyer at your firm should we contact?
 
 Thanks.
