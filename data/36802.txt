 Transaction ID 610 Product ID 35729 did not book correctly.  It is a two leg deal.  The first leg is a GD index deal and the price component has the wrong book.  It has AB-PWR-ST-GD and should be FB-CENT2.  The second leg is a F4F deal and it put the wrong value in the price component and basis component.  Previous nights price settle should be in price and $.02 should be in basis.  The deal has $.02 in price and $.00 in basis.

 I pushed a few test deals for Canadian products through and need you to review these deals in Tagg and Sitara to verify that they are booking correctly for valuation purposes.  Please let me know if you see any problems (indexes, books, pricing, etc.)  Don't worry about the deal highlighted in pink..I am working on getting this to bridge.
 
 Please reply by e-mail!!!
