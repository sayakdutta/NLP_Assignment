 
 Martin,
 
 Can you prepare a draft of recommendation for  Eric?
 I can elaborate more and sign it.

 Vince,
 
 My phone is (650) 725-0541 (office).
 
 I am still in a state of shock about Enron and I am still absorbing all the
 news I can.  It is almost unbelievable to me that the company I worked for
 this summer is now essentially kaput.
 
 From the website I contacted you from, I take it that you are no longer with
 Enron.  Please accept my deepest sympathies and best wishes in what must
 surely be a difficult time.  I hope you were not as heavily invested in Enron
 as many employees seemed to be.
 
 I wanted to contact you regarding letters of recommendation.  I'm currently
 looking for summer employment, in particular at network providers (such as
 AT&T and IBM) as well as some financial institutions.  Would it be any
 trouble for you to write a note on my behalf?  They may be requested via
 email, so an actual letter may not be necessary.  I would have more details
 later.
 
 My best to you and your family and all those I knew this summer ---
 
 Eric
