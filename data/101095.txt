 However, I am getting up every morning at 6 to go run so that ought to count 
 for extra.  Besides when did this become a contest I wouldn't think you'd 
 consider me a worthy adversary... at least not yet.  I do know the model 
 you're speaking of, but isn't she married to some billionaire in Venezuela?
