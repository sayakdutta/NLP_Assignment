 the person who would sign was out of town, but was supposed to be back last 
 week.  I'll be glad to follow up.   I was out last week and just haven't 
 worked to that point on my "to do" list.
 
 NEPCO and EECC have signed, by the way.

 Hi Kay.  Hope you had a good holiday.
 
 Any success on the letter?
 
 Thanks,
