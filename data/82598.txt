 Keep in mind, Tom Bass Park has 3 Sections, we are in Tom Bass Park Section
 1, Pavillion #2.
 
 From Downtown take 288  South, Exit 288 at the Beltway 8 Exit, make a left
 under 288, stay on the Beltway 8 Feeder Road,
 Once you've gone under 288 keep your eye on the right hand side (the
 entrance to the park is really close), the entrance to the park is  your
 first right turn, you'll see a sign that says Tom Bass Park Section 1.  Go
 into Section 1 of the park and look for Pavillion #2 ( there are three
 pavillions, Pavillion 2 has the light blue play area, you can't miss it).
 
 Bring your favorite games, etc.
