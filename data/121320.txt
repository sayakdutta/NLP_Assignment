 
 Monica,
 
 Attached are the price indications that you asked for.  Let me know if you want to do anything or if you have any questions.  
 
 Thanks,

 I am assuming you're looking at the "daily" tab.  The first column reflects
 actual usage.  The second column is a 30 day rolling average.
 
 Could I get price indications from you today for a customer of ours.  Their
 load is pretty small, ~ 200 MMBtu/day.  I need monthly prices at Malin and
 Citygate starting July 2001 through June 2003.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Monica
 
 
     
 
 Monica,
 
 What is the difference in the volumes in the first column and those in the
 second column?  I am working on this today and must discuss with the desk -
 who will be managing the extra risk.  I hope to have something back to you
 by tomarrow.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kim

    Thank you for allowing us the opportunity to interview you as our
    potential
    natural gas supplier.  We will make our selection by May 3, 2001 and
    would
    like to give you one final opportunity to send us your final proposal.
 
    As was discussed in the interview, it is the City's desire to avoid
    daily
    price risk and EFO/OFO penalties.  We understand that the changing
    market
    warrants the end user to take on more of that risk or to pay for it in
    the
    form of premiums, however, we also realize that our load is relatively
    constant and driven mainly by weather.  I have attached over three years
    of
    daily historical usage for the City.  Please consider this information
    when
    submitting your final proposal.
 
    Please email me your final proposal by May 2, 2001.
 
    Regards,
 
    Monica V. Padilla
