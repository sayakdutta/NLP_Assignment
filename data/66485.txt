 
 r&r was fun.  we went downtown first and it sucked.  i felt like i was in kabul w/ all of al queda.  r&r was packed though.  i didn't get there until around 1am.  when are you going home?
 
  
     
 
 no, i didn't end up going out.  i went out friday night and felt hung over until 
 about 5 on saturday, so i decided to take it easy.  
 i heard you went to R&R.  how was it?  did you have a good time? 
 i was going to call you yesterday to ask you about it. 
  
     what is going on?  did you end up going out on sat?
