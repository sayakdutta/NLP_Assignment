 I just sent you a fax of the information which I currently have in my possession regarding the ICSC Law Conference.   I have a call into Shirleen Glasin (the individual here in Houston who is putting together the PowerPoint Presentation for Laurie) to see if there has been any discussions regarding Jeff's portion of the presentation; i.e., whether there would only be one PowerPoint Presentation prepared wherein Laurie would present her portion of the discussion and then Jeff would pick up and finish with the deregulation portion of the discussion,, or if there would be two separate presentations prepared all together.  I have scheduled a meeting between Laurie and Shirleen for next Wednesday, October 10, 2001 at 2:00 p.m. (CST) to discuss the presentation(s).  It would probably be beneficial for Jeff to attend this meeting via telephone if he is available to do so.
 
 
 
    
  
 no worries! I can call her...as a matter of fact, I did but hung up because I had to take another call! 
 
 You're so kind! 
 
 Thanks,

 I have not forgot about you . . . I have placed a call to Jennifer Degnan asking her to forward me the forms which you would need to fill out (trying to save you some trouble since you have just kind of been thrown into this).  I will fax them as soon as I get them.  I have already received a copy of the hotel reservations form from ICSC travel.
