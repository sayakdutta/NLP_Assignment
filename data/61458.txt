 John,
 I am the ENA Staffing Coordinator for the Associate and Analyst Program.  
 Attached is a list of incoming Analyst that will begin next Monday and are 
 scheduled to go into the Trading organization per a resume review you had 
 done .  We are trying to identify exactly who these people will need to 
 report too in order to communicate to the Analyst and to also update our 
 database with correct rotation information.  We would like to tell the 
 Analyst exactly where they would go by Monday 17th.  Can you please advise me 
 on who I need to contact in the Trading orgainzation in order to get these 
 final placements made?  
 
 Thank you,
 Jana
