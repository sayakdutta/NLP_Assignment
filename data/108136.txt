 Jeff,
 
 Last week we discussed looking at your cost of people in the Singapore 
 office.  If you could check out the cost for lower-level manager types I 
 would be most appreciative.  I have already discussed this with Lilian Low of 
 HR Singapore so if this was your planned course of action I've already 
 covered that base - she told me managers are about the same US$ amount as in 
 Houston.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Bob
 
 PS - That was a most evil joke you played on Lavorato......I enjoyed it 
 immensely.
