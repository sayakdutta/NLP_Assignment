 Looks like there is alot of work needed on Cathy's draft. I'm working this weekend and hopefully we all can meet on Monday.  Meanwhile can you get from John anything in writing that we used in connection with opposing the Bingham bill.  Those arguments would be very helpful to maybe repeat in the FERC response

 Answering Susan's question, the EPMI's draft comments on the reporting requirement NOPR are in fact consistent with our position on the Bingaman bill.  As initially drafted, that bill would essentially require FERC to do what it proposes in this NOPR to under its existing discretionary authority.  We have used many of the arguments in the draft comments in our discussions against this aspect of the Bingaman draft.

 Attached is a draft of EPMI's comments on the Reporting Requirements NOPR.  Alan Comnes and I will be working with ENA Legal on some revisions to the draft and will circulate those revisions within the next few days.  Of course we would welcome your comments at any time.  John, I assume this is consistent with our position on the Bingaman bill but let us know if anything needs to be changed.  
 
 EPMI's comments are due next Friday, October 5.

   Attached are the draft comments.  I apologize for the delay.  We were distracted by the FERC meeting - exciting day.  You all must be happy about the Commission's discussions on RTOs but uncertain about the market power initiatives.
 
    Please call Sam or me with any comments on the filing.  
 
 Thank you, 
 
 Cathy
