 I left on your chair the commnets to the amendment agreements.  Could you 
 please confirm with Lisa that it makes sense to have the additional 
 bankruptcy termination enevts as "automatic" triggers in your document when 
 in the fianncial master it is drafted as an election.  Please e-mail the 
 revised agreement to KCS' counsel - Zachary May and copy Harry Stout.
