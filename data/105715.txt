 
 Jane:
 
 Susan is trying to revise the Services Agreement once again and the 
 "governing law" issue was raised.  I do not have any memoranda addressing 
 which choice of law would be binding on Enron Japan Corp.  However, I note 
 that the draft ISDA marked by our Japanese counsel for use by Enron Japan 
 Corp. and IBJ elects New York law (AA email to me dated 9/21/00).  Are either 
 Texas or New York law preferable for the Services Agreement? 
 
 Thanks for your assistance.  Regards.
