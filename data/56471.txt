 
 Melissa,
 
 Please, take a look at this resume. Any interest?
 I got it from a headhunter (I don't know her,
 it was a cold call on her part and she did not make a good impression).

 Hi there Mr. Kaminski! It was a pleasure to speak with you today. I look
 
 forward to lunch one day soon at Brennans.
 
 Wayne Tow is a brilliant man, He worked for many years for a man I know
 well.  This man says, Wayne is as good as it get, and he could do
 anything that is assigned to him, and do it at  a level in which he was
 always amazed.
 He loves the E-commerce area, and this is what he wants to do
 Thank you, Vince.
