 Girl, so very sorry to hear about your relatives.  That is awful, such young people.  I will keep them and all of their their families in prayer.  If there is anything I can do to help, please let me know.  If you need help with the kids or anything.
 
 Also, sorry about the choir,  what's wrong with Doren, he's seems to be sick alot.  Greg will probably "fire his ass" this week for messing up his "Big Day" on Easter.  That's a shame!
 
 You mean to tell me you wore the new dress without the blouse/jacket.  That is wonderful, I told you not to worry about your arms.  You did look real good in the dress, the colors were beautiful.
  We need to shop together more often.
 
 Yes, I will be at choir tonight.
 
 See you then!
