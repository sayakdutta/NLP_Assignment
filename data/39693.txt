 Dear Mark and Bob,
 
 We will be kicking-off the above group in January. The core members are
 scheduled to meet in advance to discuss the priority and order of the issues
 to be discussed. For this purpose, I would appreciate if you could arrange
 for someone to send me the minutes of the past committee meetings in NY and
 London. If they are not open to non-chairs or the ISDA Board, I will digest
 it and reduce them into plain Japanese summary.
 
 Thank you for your cooperation.
 
 Regards,
 
 Terry
