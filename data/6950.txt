 My peice of this, the language component, is easy to do. The trouble comes in 
 with logistics. We need to check with the Sitara Group to see if this is 
 feasible. In the OTC world it's a lay-up because you can enter the different 
 legs into the system and skip the weekends. The issue re: doing this on EOL 
 is the ability of the system NOT TO NOMINATE on certain dates.
 
 Scott Mills is out on vacation until Monday and he's the man I have to see. I 
 will follow up with him next week.
