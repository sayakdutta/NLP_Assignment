 Can you pass this along to Elizabeth to ensure Sanders is on board as well?  We are renewing our L/C's on a month to month basis for the PX per Sanders.  However, the request below is to "replenish" the CASH that was drawn down...please advise.

 Tracy,  Do we have concerns here.  We pointed out to the PX that there was excess credit.  By using collateral to pay these bills are we not keeping required levels available?
