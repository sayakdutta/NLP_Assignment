 Team,
 
 Can we please amend the collateral threshold in the draft ISDA for the above 
 referenced counterparty?  The new collateral threshold amount should be 
 $2,500,000.  No other changes are necessary to the document and I hope 
 therefore that a full credit worksheet will not be necessary.
 
 Please call me if you have any questions.  Fred is looking for this asap, so 
 if we could have it to him by noon or so tomorrow, he will be quite 
 appreciative.
 
 
 Thanks,
 
 John
