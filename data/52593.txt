 
 Helyette,
 
 Thanks for your message. I am in London right now and I shall attend the RISK conference
 this week. Stinson Gibner left Enron and I have  another person in charge of software.
 I hope to close the loop in the next few days.

 Dear Vince,
 Your collaborator had kindly sent me a new contract proposal 5 weeks ago.He was supposed to have it checked by your lawyers but I never heard from him again.
 I have been approached by 2 major software companies
 and may sign some kind of agreement with one of them.
 I believe it would be better to finalize our project
 before it becomes a subset of a huge machinery.
 Will you be in London on June 28?
 I fly to the States on July 6,will be in New York on
 the 8&9 and in Houston on the 15&16 of July
 Hoping to see you or get some news
 Helyette
