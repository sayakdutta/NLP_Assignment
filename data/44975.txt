 Tana,
 
 If George only needs read access, you can just send him the database link and 
 he should be ready to go (remember -  we opened the system up to everyone).  
 Let me know if you need antyhing else.

 Mike,
 
 Can you grant George Hope with the Online Team, view access only to the Legal 
 Online Trading Database.  Can you let us know when his approval comes in.  
 Thanks!
