 that message as someone has called, but I wanted to let you know also.

 Hello Mr. Lay,
 
 It's been a long time since we've talked.  I'm Priscilla Slade, President of
 Texas Southern University.  The primary purpose of this e-mail is to invite
 you to attend a weekend at the home of President and Mrs. Bush September
 16-18.  So many people have expressed a desire to become know more about the
 University (it's new initiatives and successes) that  President Bush
 volunteered to host a gathering of 25 CEOs and spouses (or a second person
 in the corporate hierarchy).  In addition to having fun golfing, sailing,
 boating, etc., we are presenting ALL YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT TEXAS SOUTHERN
 UNIVERSITY.
 
 I know this is your favorite topic and that we can look forward to you
 joining us.  An invitation is in the mail.  I look forward to you joining
 us.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Priscilla
