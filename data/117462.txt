 
 Greg:
 
 Here are my comments to the first of the Long Descriptions.  I was afraid I 
 might be missing something about the way you guys do these deals in Canada so 
 I thought I would run this one by you first to make sure I had the concepts 
 right before I tackle the rest of them.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Mark

 Mark, as discussed, please find attached for your review and approval the 
 long descriptions of the three financial power products that Enron Canada 
 wants to trade on EOL.  Please let me know if you have any comments or 
 concerns with the attachment, so that we can commence the process of getting 
 these instituted on EOL.
 
 Thanks
 
 Greg
