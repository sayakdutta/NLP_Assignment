 
 Hi Jeannie,
 
 Several months ago I met with Jennifer Milligan regarding part-time 
 employment. I still have an interest in this area, and thought I would drop 
 you a note to see if you know of any upcoming opportunities/positions within 
 the company.  I have no definite time frame, but I do know that I do have a 
 strong interest in part-time employment.  Please let me know if anything 
 comes up, and also if we need to meet.
 
 I would appreciate discretion regarding my search for part-time employment ( 
 please do not discuss with Hunter) as I do not want to jeopardize my position 
 on the desk or have him thinking that I'm not giving 100% because I'm 
 interested in part-time employment.  I've casually mentioned this to him in 
 the past, so he's somewhat aware, but probably did not take me very seriously.
 
 Thanks for your help!
