 
 Further to our collective conversations yesterday,   I have contacted counsel 
 for CES and have sent   via fax the Consents of Assignment for both parties 
 for execution stressing the need for a quick turn around.    Upon execution, 
 I will amend the agreements for new pricing.
 
 Please let me know if you have an questions or comments.
