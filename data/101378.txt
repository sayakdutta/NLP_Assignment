 I just wanted to let you know all of the LCG pipeline is accurate for June business.  I have the usage tickets in too.  (#806233 for WIC/LCW and #806236 for CIG/LCK).
 
 FUGG usage ticket is in (WIC/MBW #806237)  We are still working on the producer side.
 
 The North Central volume for the LOS OP point is 783.  Do you want me to create this deal?
 
 Let me know.
