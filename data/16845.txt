 Got your message.  Be happy to be on a call today to discuss California's gas 
 structure.  Just let me know when.
 
 Best to all, 
 Jeff

 Here is a summary of AGL prepared by Tom Chapman.
 
 


   
 
 	
 
 I wanted to follow-up with everyone following yesterday's meeting. 
 
 It appears to me that we need to develop (1) a better analysis of the four 
 market models - AGL (Steve M), Columbia of Ohio (Janine), Socal Gas (Jeff), 
 NICOR (Roy) - based on some key elements and (2) the key Influence parties in 
 Illinois with 5 layer Influence Circles that we need to be thinking about in 
 this discussion.
 
 It would be great if we could get this to Laura for distribution by end of 
 day Friday (realize it's tight).
 
 Key elements for Market Models --
 
 1. Direct Access Allowed?  For What customers?  What timeline?
 2. Upstream Capacity resolution - assignment or otherwise?  Are there assets 
 left to optimize
 3. Retail pricing - Fixed price vs. PBR (how?) vs. something else?
 4. Role of Wholesale Outsourcing Agent (would ENA sell to marketers or 
 utilities or both?)
 5. Other Issues
 
 Thanks,
 
 Jim
