 An elderly woman and her little grandson, whose face 
 was sprinkled 
 with bright freckles, spent the day at the zoo. ?Lots 
 of children 
 were waiting in line to get their cheeks painted by a 
 local artist 
 who was decorating them with tiger paws. 
 
 "You've got so many freckles, there's no place to 
 paint!" a girl in 
 the line said to the little fella. 
 
 Embarrassed, the little boy dropped his head. His 
 grandmother knelt 
 down next to him. "I love your freckles. When I was a 
 little girl I 
 always wanted freckles," she said, while tracing her 
 finger across 
 the child's cheek. "Freckles are beautiful." 
 
 The boy looked up, "Really?" 
 
 "Of course," said the grandmother. "Why just name me 
 one thing that's 
 prettier than freckles." 
 
 The little boy thought for a moment, peered intensely 
 into his 
 grandma's face, and softly whispered, "Wrinkles."
