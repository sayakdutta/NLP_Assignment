 Dan, here's our first ever market commentary.  I gather the information will 
 be very stale by the time eol v2 is up and running and that this will serve 
 primarily as a place holder in our web page.
 From our perspective, we'd much prefer to have indenpendent "neutral" sources 
 (such as Platts, ICIS, CMAI ....) do the analysis, or at least do a feed.  
 The reason is (a) we'll never be construed as neutral and (b) we're so thin 
 that the traders themselves are the only ones who can put this together.
 
 
 
 Thanks,
 Alan
