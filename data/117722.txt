 
 I think we are doing Hawaiian shirts - we just don't want everyone to know 
 yet.  Yes - please include all the offices - also include Singapore & Buenos 
 Aires.  Tana will let you know which people in the London office will be 
 coming.

 I thought we were doing hawaiian shirts.  I'll get an email done tomorrow.  
 You want everyone right, Canada, London, etc.  
 
 
    
 Suzanne:
 
 Please send an e-mail to all of the lawyers and paralegals in the ECT Legal 
 Dept. asking them to reserve the conference dates and asking them to let you 
 know their t-shirt sizes.   Once you have everyone's t-shirt sizes, please 
 give the list to Dan.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Mark
