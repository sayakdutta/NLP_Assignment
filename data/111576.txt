 Richard Sanders , our litigation manager, was okay with this since this just

 With respect to your second question, I will talk to Mark about it and get 
 back to you.

 - What is our exposure to Federal Law?

 David:
 Enclosed for your review is a draft amendment letter for the above 
 counterparty.  All of the requested chnages are driven by the fact that BPA 
 is a federal agency.  I look forward to hearing from you.
