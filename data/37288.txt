 weary of teams "tricking" us early in games.  Too me, that translates to 
 "outcoached".  Maybe I'm being unreasonable, but they should have the talent 
 next year.  We'll see.  You had to love OSU kicking the shit out of the 
 domers.  Looks like Erickson has brought the thug factor back into college 
 football.
