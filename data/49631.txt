 It's OK for Walter to use remaining hours. No real cost to Enron,
 just the benefits.

 Walter Coffer contacted me regarding whether we still have power flow 
 software available.  We do have almost all of a 200 execution-hour license 
 for PSS/E, which was purchased for the transmission congestion project last 
 summer.  This was purchased by East Power Trading.  Should Walter want to use 
 the remaining hours, who has authority to grant this?
 
 Thanks,
 Martin
