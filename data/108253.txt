 like.  Jeff

 Jeff,
 
 HTC got back to me saying that they are interested in having me rotate to 
 their group. They want me to schedule a brief meeting with Steve Horn to let 
 him know that I will be the next Enron person over there. My only concern is 
 that they would like me to get there a bit earlier than scheduled (probably 
 around 15 to 30 days before). I am extremely interested in this rotation but  
 hope that transferring early does not create any problems. Do you have any 
 suggestions on how I might tackle this issue?
 
 Thank you so much for everything
 
 Massimo
