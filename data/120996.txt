 
 Lyndon,
 
 I finally got my CDs back yesterday and I was so happy!  Thanks again for making sure that they were sent to Miami.  How are you?  Where are you?  where have you been?  Since I have to sit in this office everyday staring at a computer screen, I must live vicariously through people like you!  I'm actually not traveling until mid september.  I go to Denver on sept. 8 - 10 and then to Southern California the following week.  October brings Arizona, Aruba, and perhaps northern california.  Looking forward to Aruba - don't really care about the rest since they are work!!  Anyway - hope all is well with you and that you are enjoying yourself - wherever you might be!
 
 Take care,
