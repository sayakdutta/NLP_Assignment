 Jeff:
 
 About a month ago, we asked EOL to create three new products for the 
 financial petrochemical and plastics desk.  They are:
 
 1.  propylene (polymer grade), 
 2.  a polypropylene to propylene spread, and
 3.  a polyethylene to ethylene spread.
 
 We expect to have these rolled out this week.
