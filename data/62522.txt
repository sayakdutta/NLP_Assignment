 Hey Chris;
 
 The property with the party room facing the Gardiner (not Gardener dumb ass)
 has already garnered me offers worth $120,000 more than I paid for my suite,
 which means I could use just my profit portion to purchase the property next
 to yours! I wouldn't live there though, as I have a red Rumplestiltsken like
 acquaintance whose looking to move into a neighborhood where he can "feel
 comfortable." The $200 monthly rent I'd get would come in handy in my
 philanthropic endeavors in helping rid the world of Red Scourge Disease,
 which is deadly when left unchecked and unabated.
 
 Keep 'em coming pal, you serve them up and we'll keep knockin' them out!
 
 Take care Red mate.
 
 
 Joseph Galea.
