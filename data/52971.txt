 Can you help this guy?

 Dear Vince J Kaminski,
 
 As a Mathematical Trading and Finance MSc student (City
 University London) I am writing my dissertation on "power
 forward curves".
 
 Since you have participated in the writing of the
 book "Managing Energy Price" I was wondering if you could
 eventually help me.
 The MRHV model seams to be the best econometric one to
 model the electricity forward curve.
 
 I understand and know how to work out with the classic Mean
 Reverting Process, but I don't understand the MRHV (I don't
 know the discretised form and I cannot even find any paper,
 or article on it) and how to get rid of the exponent to
 estimate my parameters (long-run mean, Speed of mean
 reversion, volatility, exponent, Floor price).
 
 Thank you by advance for any help
 
 Yours sincerely
 Sylvain Joret
