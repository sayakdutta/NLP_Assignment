    We need to terminate this (unilaterally if possible, or if not, bilaterally) and move towards settlement now (it's better to move to settlement prior to a default which I believe will be on Monday).  Who is not being responsive? I'll track them down and get an answer if I have to. I think that we're too late for today, so let's do it in the morning.

 I have not heard back from wasaff. Unless rod feels otherwise, I would send the early termination. We are having major communication problems with wasaff and others.

 I assume you haven't received an answer from RMTC?  Greg
