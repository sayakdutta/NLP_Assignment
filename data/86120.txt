 Gerald,
 
 Attached are my edits to the letter. Daphne will prepare a version that is
 without all of the deletions and additions so it is easier to read. You can
 compare the two to see exactly what I have done.
 
 My edits are in blue. Comments are in bold blue and bracketed.
 
 ECS may be over the barrel here and this may be the best deal that you can
 get. But it isn't a deal because it is all illusory.
 
 They agree to try to complete construction by a date certain (no recourse if
 they don't) in exchange for an ECS guarantee to reimburse Gulf for an amount
 that they think is fair (that is the only standard - they have no
 responsibility justify and we have no ability to verify that amount).
 
 In general, Gulf is allowed contributions in aid of construction and can
 stop construction if they don't get it. If our existing agreements clearly
 provide for a guaranteed term and minimum load, and those provisions are
 linked to the costs of construction (so no further contribution from ECS was
 contemplated in those agreements), then I think that ECS can hold them to
 the deal.
 
 We have no contract with WFEC so if the PSC decides in their favor we may
 have to petition the PSC and ask that we not be financially damaged by their
 decision and Gulf's incorrect representation (upon which we relied) that our
 facility was in a territory that they could serve. I think (but have not
 researched the point) that ECS would have standing as a customer. I believe
 that the commissioners and their non lawyer staff would be sympathetic to
 our situation.
 
 However, if we agree to a capped amount of reimbursement then their may be
 no issue for the PSC to decide. As of now Gulf has changed the deal on ECS.
 If ECS accepts the change (unless under protest) then a court or the
 commission will probably consider the matter moot. I'm not sure about the
 legal effect of "signing under protest" in this context but can do some
 research if you think that useful.
 
 In any event I think that the letter should recite more of the history of
 this negotiation and the early agreements or representations that are now
 modified. I know our clients hate lawyers but we should try to have as clean
 a record as possible if we think that we may have to seek relief. I don't
 have any of the agreements at issue here and there is probably more that
 should be included in the letter to give the context in which it is written
 and signed.
 
 More later. Call when you can.
 
 Bill
