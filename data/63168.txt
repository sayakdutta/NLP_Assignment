 
 I am working with CIBC on another credit mitigation deal.  They are 
 interested but they have said nothing yet on pricing levels.  I am sending 
 them something on Monday that will propose a Enron payment on Friday December 
 17th of approximately $16 MM CAD.   Again, this payment would come from the 
 U.S. office so if there are any administrative things that need to get done I 
 suggest we get on it quickly.  I assume Juanita needs to deal with funding 
 and Louie needs to secure a letter from CIBC re credit mitigation.  I'm in 
 Houston part of the week but you can track me done through my secretary.  
 
 Regards
