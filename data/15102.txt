 Sean,
 
 This is just to confirm our conversation over the phone on 12/04/01 at about
 9:45 AM Pacific Time.
 You stated that Enron will not be able to deliver the 10 MW HLH energy MID C
 product to Grays Harbor PUD starting at HE 7 for 12/05/01.
 
 Pursuant to Section 21.3 of the WSPP Agreement we will take steps to
 mitigate damages for failure to deliver power.
 
 Please reply with your written confirmation.
 
 Thanks,
