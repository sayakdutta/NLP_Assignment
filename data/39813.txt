 in a bullet list format.  Thanks.  Mark

 Mark -
 
 Attached is the EGA Legal report for February.  I'm interested in your 
 feedback on level of detail.  Some of our contributors gave quite a bit of 
 detail (e.g., India) while others were quite a bit more brief (although 
 generally on less important projects).
 
 Also, I've left out discussion of the South America assets.  I'm assuming 
 that is coming from John/Randy -- I know that Miguel Mendoza is inputting to 
 them on most of these assets.
 
 Thanks,
 Bruce
