 I thought you may find this message from one of BPA's attorney's of interest.

 Andy,
 
 We still have some internal work to do before we can say whether there is
 any chance BPA will use the EEI contract in the future.  Personally, I think
 this depends largely on what the prevailing industry trading arrangements
 are, and that seems to be the WSPP agreement right now.  But our eyes and
 ears are open.  I will be attending the conference and expect it to be very
 informative.  Thanks for sending out the brochure.

 Here's the final conference brochure.  The last panel of the day has a
 comparison of the EEI and the WSPP and what the future holds for each.  If
 you were inclined, having your thoughts on which agreement the BPA would
 likely embrace in the future would be helpful.  If you speak, you get to
 attend the entire conference for free.  Also, please feel free to pass the
 brochure on to any counterparties in the west that you think would benefit.
 FYI, if there is enough interest we can try to arrange getting additional
 rooms at the Four Seasons at the conference rate.  If that is not an option,
 there is a Mariott that we have a national account w/ that is only 5 minutes
 from the Four Seasons.  If we get enough overflow we will guarantee the
 Mariott a block of rooms to get a discount rate.  I

 Thanks Andy.
 
 I'm hoping to come to Newport, but am not yet sure it will work out.  What
 did you have in mind re: the EEI presentation?  (It looks like you have some
 time on the Newport agenda.)

 I don't have a final brochure on this, but here is a draft.  I've also
 attached my law review article on the EEI Contract.  I can't recall if I
 gave you  one at the WSPP meeting in S.F.  Hope all is going well.  If BPA
 would like me to do a separate presentation on the EEI Contract, I can
 arrange that as well.
