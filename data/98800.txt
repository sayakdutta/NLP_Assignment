 
 My first choice is Carrin Patman or Bruce Oakley at Bracewell--Tel. no. 
 713-223-2900. My second choices are Ron Welch and Knox Nunnally at Vinson And 
 Elkins #713-758-2222. Lastly, Barrett Reasoner at Gibbs and Bruns 
 #713-650-8805. Of course if TransCanada is already a defendant, I might 
 recommend different counsel depending on which judge they drew. If Duane has 
 any questions please have him call me at 713-853-5587.

 Richard, a friend of mine at TransCanada Energy is looking to retain 
 Houston-based litigation counsel, and was wondering who we could recommend.  
 He assures me that the matter does not involve an Enron entity.  Accordingly, 
 could you please provide me with a name and contact for litigation counsel 
 you would recommend at V&E, Bracewell Patterson, Andrews & Kurth or otherwise?
 
 Many thanks,
 Peter
