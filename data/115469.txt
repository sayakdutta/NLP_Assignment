 
 I'm killing deal 539968 at Sharon Cason's request - it was previously killed 
 and she needed me to reinstate it so she could sort out the confirm. Then I 
 had to re-kill it.

 mike swerzbin, and can you give me the deal number that you are killing, 
 unless you have already told sharon or amy, so that we make sure we have not 
 already sent a confirm.
 
 thanks
 
 
 
 

 
   
  
 Mike still has about 6 deals to put in, and those are two of them. It should 
 just be a minute. 
 
 I'm killing a deal right now so my deal entry is tied up - who's the trader 
 on 541368?
