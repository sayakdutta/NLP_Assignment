 Isn't it crazy.  Someone is selling a risk management book that they gave us in a class here for $900.  Unbelievable.  I am putting stuff out there tomorrow when it comes in.  We have a signature shop here that we can buy that same sleeve of balls for $4.

 Box of 3 golf balls are currently $77.
 

 not sure what happened.  I think I am fixing to put a whole bunch of
 Enron
 stuff on Ebay, people are making money hand over fist with this stuff.

    That's the address that I sent it to that was returned.
 
    Went to Florida yesterday morning and came back this morning.
 

    I think they have finally changed the way our addresses work.  It
 is

 UBS.

       I saw that in USA Today as I was getting on a plane this moring.
 
       I tried to send you an email to enron.com day before yesterday
 and
    it
       was returned saying it didn't exist.  Curious.
