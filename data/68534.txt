 Hello Everyone!
 
 Please let us know if your traders are planning on trading on EOL Thursday the 22nd, and Friday the 23rd.  Thanksgiving, of course, is an Enron holiday and Exchange holiday, however we know that the traders sometimes still trade on holidays!
 
 Let us know the level of trading so we can prepare for coverage on our end.
 
 Thanks,
 TARA
