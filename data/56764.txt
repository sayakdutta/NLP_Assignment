 Good Morning Vince!
 
 I re-wrote three of the worst sentences from the standpoint of good grammar.  
 If you don't have time to review what I sent you, that's okay.  We can go 
 with it for today, but as I said in my earlier e-mail, I'll be soliciting 
 articles from people who have not yet contributed.  May I use your name? 
 
 ThankYou!
 
 Sam
