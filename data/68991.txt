 I am in receipt of your OA forms for the purchase of gas from
 Sithe for the month of December 2000.  These forms are not complete
 in that they do not include the liquidations of the hedges that were
 put into place to protect Enron from an unfavorable shift in prices.
 These were power hedges
 
 Addtionally, there were top-line entries that were flashed to more
 accurately reflect what the actual prices were to be at the end
 of the month. 
 
 The top-line entries as well as the hedge liquidations all
 need to be included to create a complete picture.  At this time I do
 not have the tagg numbers or copies of the top line entries.  The
 top line entries should be available from the flash files.
 
 Please give me a call so that we can work together to resolve
 this OA variance.
