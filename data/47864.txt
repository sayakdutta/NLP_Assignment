 Did you have a chance to get to this yet?  I had an e-mail from Loudcloud 
 asking status.
 
 Thanks.

 Attached are the comments Loudcloud submitted to the NDA.  With the exception 
 of the deletion of the arbitration provisions, the changes are acceptable and 
 should be incorporated into a final agreement.  I have agreed to the 3 year 
 term in exchange for the arbitration provisions.
 
 Please let me know if you should have any questions.
 
 Thanks.

 Thanks for the comments to the NDA.  All are acceptable except -
 
 Paragraph 5 - Deletion of arbitration.
 
 Paragraph 9 - Change from two years to three years.
 
 Please advise if Loudcloud can live with arbitration and 2 years.  If not, 
 please advise why not.
 
 Thanks.

 questions.  I look forward to receiving your reply shortly.
