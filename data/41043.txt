 
 I have asked Corporate where it will be reported in the 4th qtr, if it's not going to be reported as wholesale then there is no real reason to bother Wes.     
 
  
     
 Given the deterioration in outlook for several of the Nepco projects--especially Kendall, Jenks, and Linden there are significant potential losses that may need to be recognized this quarter.  I wanted to make sure there was full understanding of the situation and discussion regarding our approach.
