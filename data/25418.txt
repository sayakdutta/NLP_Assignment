 Kim, Mary, 
 Please forward this on to your people. 
 
 I hope you are ready to BOWL!!!!  Tomorrow we will meet in the lobby at 2:45 
 and begin to load our buses and depart for the bowling alley.  Their will be 
 two buses departing at 2:45 and at 3:00 just to make sure we get any 
 stragglers.  
 
 As soon as we arrive you will join your team members (your teams have already 
 been chosen and there is no swapping, negotiating or shuffling allowed).  You 
 will be notified tomorrow as we depart who is on your team and their will be 
 signs at the bowling alley marking the lanes for each team. 
  
 Our plan is to bowl three games or until time allows.  At 5:30 we will gather 
 for prizes and awards and depart at 6:00. 
 
 Please see your admin today for your bowling shirt.  We highly encourage you 
 to wear it tomorrow, either with jeans or khakis, whichever you prefer.  If 
 you don't wear your shirt, you run the risk of being ridiculed by your 
 co-workers, sticking out like a sore thumb when you bowl, or being left out 
 of any future reindeer games (just teasing).
 
 If you have any questions please see your admin. 
 
 Thank you!
 Yvette
