 
 we've been trying to sell about 5000 of imbalance gas a day.  lone star is aware of it and approves.
 
  
     
 Just curious, what are we doing with the Lone Star imbalance?  Given that our contract price is in the money and we've already paid for the gas sitting on the pipe, is there a trade to be made with Lone Star?
