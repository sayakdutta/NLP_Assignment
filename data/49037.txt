 
 John,
 
 It does not sound silly to me.  I don't get that many opportunities to sit 
 down
 with those guys in a relaxed atmosphere and chat.
 
 I shall read the notes and get back to you. I have just come back from
  Philadelphia and have to catch up  with a few things.

 Vince,
 
 i know that you are in Philadelphia today but wanted to ship you my "first
 pass notes" before I leave town in the morning.  Please edit/add to or
 delete anything you think is appropriate.  My objective in the notes is
 just to get things down on paper before too much time has passed.  When I
 place something in  quotes this indicates a direct quote.
 
 I'll give you a call next week when I get back to town.  Thanks again for a
 truly memorable experience.  I plan to frame Jeff's Enron model.  It may
 sound silly to you guys but we academics really appreciate opportunities
 like the one I got on Monday.  What a truly spectacular day.
 
 Take care,
 
 John
 
 p.s. Andy gave me his note care describing the demand for a peaking plant
 but I wasn't able to get him to sign it.  I hope I did not offend him by
 asking for his signature on that silly graph.  After I left his office it
 occured to me that he might think I was making light of him.  Please
 explain to him that I was not and will treasure his simple model as
 capturing the essence of optionality in a real asset.
