 
 I have a heavy meeting/conference call schedule.  To be honest with you, I'm 
 a bit unclear on who is doing what with this.  Any advice/insight?

 Yeh, finally figured it out. I am trying to get out of town tomorrow, and 
 this is on top of some other hurry-up stuff, so I will likely miss. Scotty 
 will be there. Any chance youguys cna talk and geton the same page, or define 
 differences, before then?
