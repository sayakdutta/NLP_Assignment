 
 KC,
 
 We need a confidentiality agreement relating to asset management services for 
 Intergen.  We may have a confidentiality agreement in place - please check 
 with K Young.  It probably won't cover this.  Plus, I think this should be in 
 the name of EPMI - Reagan, what do you think?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
