 Apparently I spoke too soon.  Fourteen ideas were deposited into the 
 ThinkBank today -- including entries from Frankfurt, Toronto, London and 
 Pleasanton, California.  All levels of employees have participated from 
 assistant to senior director.

 Well, it seems that eThink has another hit.  Twelve people have already put 
 well-conceived business ideas into the ThinkBank and we have received 
 numerous congratulatory calls.  I won't have site hits until next week, but 
 the active participation has been the highest of all our current applications 
 on their respective launch day.
 
 Have a great weekend,
 Sarah.
