 
 Theresa and Nicole,
 
 Jay and I were wondering if it would be possible for you to make copies of all the existing transportation contracts for the Denver desk and Fed-Ex them to the Houston office.  Currently we do not have any of these contracts available to us here and feel it would be beneficial to have them on hand.  As you know, we are both trying to get up to speed on this book and all it's components and therefore it is important that we  understand all of the available options these contracts allow us.  
 
 Below is a list of the contracts we have broken out on a summary sheet:
 
 	-36169000
 	-36177000
 	-33084000
 	-33085000
 	-33038000
 	-31029000
 	-33171000
 	-33175000
 	-116388
 	-903145
 	-IT-601
 	-41066000
 	-41075000
 
 If there are contracts missing from the above list, please include them in the packet as well.
 
 Thanks for all the help,
 Susan
