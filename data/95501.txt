 
 It didn't down here b/c I watched it from 5:15 - 6pm unless it actually came
 on 4pm down here with the time difference.  I bet that's what happened.

 Actually, it went on towards the end of the hour, about 5:45.  I can 
 get you a copy.

 You'll never believe it but I turned it on at 5:10 so I guess your
 interview
 was over.  If you have a copy, please send me a copy and I'll pay you
 for it.
 How's everything going?  Hope all is well.  Talk to you soon.

 interviewed me was sooooooooo hot that all I could think of was how
 good she must taste.
