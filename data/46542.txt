 I am trying to track down the dealmaker on a deal in Argentina with Duke 
 Energy International.  All I know is that Duke is trying to get a waiver from 
 us on the confidentiality provision in the master swap agreement so they can 
 use it on the Argentina deal.  Credit doesn't appear to know anything about 
 the deal.  I'm don't even know if it is an EI or an ECT deal.  It may be EI 
 because he mentioned the financing of a generator.  I don't want to waive 
 anything until I track the business guy down.  Can you ask around and let me 
 know.  Thanks!
