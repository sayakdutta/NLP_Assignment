 In order to resolve our warranty issues under the outstanding invoices with 
 SWPC (both before and after our purchase), I request that Milbank Tweed be 
 engaged for a limited review of the documentiation surrounding the issues 
 (including warranty, consequential damage, incremental labor coverage).  
 Milbank has a depth of project experience on project construction and 
 equipment suppliers and their agreements.  I would propose the West Coast 
 office and allow Ed Feo to select the appropriate personnel.
 
 While I beleive that Milbank is not the only firm that can perform this 
 engagement adequately, I do believe that they could be timely and cost 
 efficient on a issue as largely commercial issue as this.  Please let me know 
 your view as we need to resolve our options, and ultimately our course of 
 action next week.
