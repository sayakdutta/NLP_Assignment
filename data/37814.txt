I think that if I was still in structuring then I might be worried, but I am trading natural gas options and the desk I work for has been very profitable.  I think that the natural gas and power trading floors are the main reason they bought us.  I would think they would like to keep things as they are on these desks, but you never know.  It will take 6-9 months before anything happens.
 
 How are you doing?  I haven't heard from you in a while.  I would love to get together sometime.  My phone number is (713) 853-6247.  Call me sometime.
 
 I guess you are working for Jeff Young now?  He used to be my boss.  How is the Europe group?  Are they still the same?  I am not for sure how your company is set up now.  
 
 How is married life?  Is you wife in the US now?  Are you still in DC?
 
 Talk to you soon.

 Hey John,
 
 Been following the latest development of your firm. Hope everything turns
 out well in the end.
 
 Would be fun to meet up for a drink some time. I'm in Houston on a regular
 basis.
 
 Hope all is well
