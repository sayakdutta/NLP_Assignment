 
 John,
 

 
 I am compiling the  information for you. I should be able to send it in a few 
 days.

 Stinson (and Vince--don't think your e-mail address is correct)
 
 This is just a reminder about the "care package" of Enron cases and
 materials that you guys were going to send to me.
 
 Stinson, please convey this request on to Vince because I think the e-mail
 address I have is an old one.
 
 Thanks and have a great weekend.
