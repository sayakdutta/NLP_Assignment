 Since we haven't had any luck hooking up on the telephone, I wanted to 
 transmit to you an initial draft of a facility agreement, as contemplated by 
 the contract for the transformer packages for the LM's.  I would have sent 
 this to Dave, but I don't seem to have his email address.
 
 Since the WestLB financing facility is scheduled to expire soon, we need to 
 get the transformers transferred into our new facility, as well as get them 
 contractually allocated to various projects.  Please give me a call or have 
 Dave call me so that we can handle this as expeditiously as possible.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
