 We can also meet at my meager apartment.  Parking is difficult, although,
 there is one spot on the sidewalk in front of my house that the neighborhood
 has deemed a legal spot.  Do you have parking Jeff?
 
 Either is fine with me!  
 
 
     
 
 
 We can meet at my meager apartment if you like.  Around 7?

 How lame is this e-mail...
 
 (Did you complain about being on my team??)
 
 Where are we meeting tonight?  I think I may have your case study...I have
 someone's.
 
 See you tonight,
 Jackie
 
 
     
 
 Jackie,
 
 We have changed your team assignment for the Mid Program Academic
 Retreat.  You were assigned to Atlantic 5, but that team had more members
 than any other and we needed to reshuffle to achieve some parity.
 
 You are now assigned to Atlantic 4.
 
 This means that your Pre-Meeting will occur on Tuesday, and not Wednesday.
 
 Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or concerns that
 you may have.
 
 Thank you,
 
 Meg St. John
 Assistant Director, Evening MBA Program
