 
 I will be there.  I think I will start earlier in the morning because I have 
 tickets to the Astro's game.  
 
 
 
 


    
 
 I'm planning to clean out the garage this Saturday morning starting about 9
 a.m. It would be great if you two could help me sort through the things and
 help decide what is give away, throw away, or take to the Farm. It shouldn't
 take too long. Bill is coming in about noon at Hobby and I will pick him up.
 We plan to try and finish the inside of the house that afternoon. Let me
 know if you can help. Thanks.
 
 Dad
