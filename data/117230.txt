 Mark:
 
 I believe the reference to the credit annex is to the credit annex to the 
 Interest Rate ISDA Master, so I assume you or someone in your group should 
 review the amendment.   Am I correct?   I think Chase is drafting the 
 amendment.

 Prepay team;
 
 Here's the latest on the restructurings that we thought we might be doing 
 earlier in the week:
 
 Molly and Chase have worked out an arrangement whereby we can post collateral 
 under the existing deals without adversely affecting our cash position.  
 Therefore a fast-track restructuring will not be needed at this time.  Chase 
 and Teresa will negotiate an addendum to the credit annex allowing us to 
 re-hypothecate collateral, and Molly is currently working out the operational 
 issues associated with doing so.
 
 We still intend to restructure the existing deals over the next few months or 
 so; I'll advise as we get closer.
 
 Best-
 Davis
