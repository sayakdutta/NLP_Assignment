 		  high-speed Internet tax credit ...
 
 Dear Gang:
 I don't know about you folks, but I woke up to over 100 emails from Telecom 
 Reports today.  It seems to border on spam at this point.  Is anyone else 
 having this experience?  The info is very valuable, but I'm wondering if 
 there's a way to get, say, 3 emails a day rather than the 50 or more I'm 
 currently receiving.
 
 Wondering if the lights will stay on today,
 Jeff

 USA: Senators renew high-speed Internet tax credit bill. 
   
 01/23/2001 
 Reuters English News Service 
 (C) Reuters Limited 2001. 
 WASHINGTON, Jan 23 (Reuters) - A bill that would encourage businesses to 
 bring high-speed Internet access to underserved areas was reintroduced in the 
 Senate on Tuesday, with the hopes that President Bush would include the item 
 in his budget.
 Computers equipped with a "broadband" or high-speed Internet connection can 
 download information at a rate of up to 1.5 megabits per second, or about 25 
 times faster than a standard, dial-up connection. While broadband access is 
 currently available in many business districts and affluent residential 
 neighborhoods, the service has not yet spread to less affluent or more 
 sparsely populated areas. 
 The bill would provide a five-year, 10 percent tax credit to Internet 
 companies that extend broadband service to rural or underserved urban areas.
 Companies who build "next generation" networks, with download speeds of up to 
 22 megabits per second, would receive a 20 percent, five-year credit.
 The bill was introduced by Republican senators Olympia Snowe of Maine and 
 Orrin Hatch of Utah, and Democrats Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia and John 
 Kerry of Massachusetts. It was co-sponsored by 32 other senators.
 The 36 senators sent a letter to President Bush urging him to include the 
 bill in his initial budget proposal.
 The bill attracted the support of 59 senators and 115 House members last 
 year, the letter claimed.
