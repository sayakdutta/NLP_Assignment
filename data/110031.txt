 
 Tom,
 
 I believe that your right up correctly interprets the current model, but as 
 we discussed, I think the more correct methodology is to use the next day's 
 cash price since the Gas Daily print is for gas traded the previous day and 
 delivered the same day as the print.  If I'm trading day gas on April 7th, 
 the prices I'm basing my decisions on are those represented in the Gas Daily 
 print for April 8th.  If we do not change the model, I think we need another 
 sentence to clarify that the cash prices a day behind.  Of course, eventually 
 we need to fix the model.

 Matt,
 Here's a one page document showing how I have interpreted the curves data.  
 If you would like any changes, please mark up / edit and I'll make the 
 changes today.
