 Jim, in connection with your interest in identifying a top notch litigator
 in California to look after Enron's interests in California, I would
 recommend you consider David Balabian and Chris Hockett of the firm of
 McCutchen Doyle Brown and Enerson LLP. McCutchen is a 300+ lawyer firm with
 its main office in San Francisco and offices in Los Angles, Palo Alto and
 Walnut Creek. The firm has a very strong reputation in major commercial
 litigation (antitrust, securities fraud etc) and technical and IP
 litigation. I believe ENA has worked with McCutchen in the past on some
 power plant matters. Rob Walters has worked closely with Chris Hockett (who
 I have also met) and has a very high opinion of his abilities. I concur that
 Chris (a 40ish commercial litigator) is a very impressive individual. David
 Balbanian, more senior than Chris, is apparently widely known as one of the
 leading commercial litigators in  Northern California. Establishing a
 relationship with David and Chris would give you the judgment and access I
 assume you would want. Let me know if I can provide any additional
 information.  Joe
