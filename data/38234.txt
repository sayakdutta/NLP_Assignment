 
 I am not sure how to approach this.  I appreciate your comments, but the ultimate decision will be made over the next few weeks. If you would like to resign, then let me know.

 Hi Mike,
 
 First of all, I would like to thank you
 for the opportunities you presented
 to me on the West desk.  Were it
 not for the current situation I think it 
 could have been a great way to
 approach west gas trading.
 
 Since you are busy I thought it would be
 better to tell you via e-mail:  I was wondering
 if you could consider me in the next round
 of layoffs.  I do not know exactly how this is 
 decided on the management level, but
 if the topic ever comes up please bring up my name.
 I have had a great time at Enron, and of making
 your acquaintance, but I feel at  this point I would like to
 pursue another path.
 
 Thank you.
 
 -Liz.
