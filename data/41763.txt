 
 Everyone signed but ENA Upstream and Canada.  Reliant signed yesterday and brought them back to me this morning so that I can get the other signatures.  I am having the document taken to Brian Redmond to sign for ENA Upstream and then Peter Keohane will sign for ECC.  Barbara signed off on the receivables.
 
  
     
 Marie:
 
 Just checking on the status of the Reliant MNA -- did it get executed?  Did Joel sign off on it?
