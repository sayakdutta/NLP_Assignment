 He would do the paperwork and trade out of the imbalance with another party.

 Susan, Are you interested in imbalance trading for VGS?

 Brenda,
 Victor and I totally agree with you.  With the increase of wellhead 
 production and swings that we are seeing, we are totally revisiting the way 
 we handle wellhead.  Beginning with March we will be taking a closer look at 
 what our production is doing and will enter appropriate cash out tickets on 
 Venice.  
 
 Just to let you know, we are going through the process of looking at wellhead 
 production on all our pipes and at what is the best method to handle.

 Venice invoices for cashout on a one month lag.  The February invoice cashed 
 out the January  volume of <19,385> at $6.8121 for a total credit of 
 $132,052.55.  The imbalance for February production is  <4455> and to trade 
 the imbalances, VGS must be notified in writing on or before the 25th of 
 March.
 
 There are no cashout tickets for VGS on the CPR cashout reports that I ran 
 for January and February production.  From looking back at several months of 
 invoices, we appear to get cashed out every month.  Would it be possible to 
 have cashout tickets entered for VGS?
 
 If you have see any problems with the imbalance volumes reflected on the 
 invoice, please let me know. 
 
 Thanks,
 Brenda
