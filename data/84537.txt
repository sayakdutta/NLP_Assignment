 
 Attached is a short outline of the proposed steps to transfer the Compressor 
 Motors, NTUA Contract, and TW Contracts to ECS LLC.  I know we still don't 
 have structure approval, but I can begin working on the documentation for 
 those items that will not likely change (the transfer of assets and 
 contracts).
 
 Please review and let me know of any issues or problems.
