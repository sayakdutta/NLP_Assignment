 
 Attached is a redlined copy of the revised schedules to the Purchase and Sale 
 Agreements.  Also attached, for the sake of completeness, are the supplements 
 to the schedules.  The supplements are the same as prior versions, except for 
 some changes to the title defects schedules for the Maverick, Box Draw, and 
 Caballo systems.  
 
 I attempted to redline the schedules for the title defects, but it redlined 
 the whole list.  The only change of substance added was a new Wyoming DOT 
 road crossing permit to Maverick.  Also taken off were references to the 
 documents that have been prepared and sent to Gillette (that information was 
 contained in brackets and began "[See Attached ....].  That information was 
 for the right of way agents in Gillette so that they knew what documents had 
 been prepared for them.  Please let me know if you have any questions.
