 
 Right now Goldman and J Aron is unassigned, but the Goldman lawyer will be speaking to Carol re their comments to the form master netting agreement, so probably Carol will be assigned to Goldman.
 
  
     
 Is anyone working on Goldman and J Aron?
 
  
     
 Barbara:
 
 I have Williams (called Leslie and gave them to her).  Jay Williams in Credit is working on J.P. Morgan and Bill Bradford is working on Duke.  Leslie said she has already pulled Goldman and J. Aron.
 
 It looks like we should have them soon.
