 Michelle,
 
 This is a heads up to an issue developing this morning at a project site in
 Payne Creek, Florida.  As far as we know, the union is directing the
 picketing against the general contractor, OCI (a subsidiary of B&V), and not
 NEPCO who is the subcontractor to OCI.  Rick Johnson may want to
 investigate.
 
 By copy to Gail, Seth Price will evaluate whether additional claims are
 developed against OCI for any delay impacts caused by OCI to NEPCO or vice
 versa depending on who the union pipe fitters are picketing.

 I have also requested Lark to contact Seath for review of OCI requirement to
 provide access to site.
 Any other comments ?

 The pipefitters union is picketing OCI at the Payne Creek jobsite this
 morning. There are 4 pickets at the gate on Ft. Green Road. The gate system
 at the entrance has no designation as to union and non-union so they can
 picket any gate. The picket signs reference low wages according to Greg
 Renz. OCI has an agreement with Forida Maint. union ironworkers to perform
 work. Pipefitters think they should be doing the work. I am going to Payne
 Creek to meet with our supervisors on how to conduct themselves when they
 enter and exit the jobsite. At this point no activity is being directed at
 Nepco. We want to keep it that way.
 Call me on my cell phone if you need me.
