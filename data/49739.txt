 
 Al, 
 
 Thanks for  the messages. I have come back from Europe last night
 and I am in process of going through my mail.
 
 Friday this week would be a good day to meet. I am going back to
 Europe on Sunday and shall be gone for a week.

 Vince:  I hope all is well with you.  I look forward to chatting with
 you soon.  Maybe we should have an early coffee meeting at the Hyatt
 Regency when your schedule permits.  Al Arfsten
