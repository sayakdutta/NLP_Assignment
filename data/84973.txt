 There aren't really any parking garages close to the ballpark and getting 
 near the ballpark on an open lot will be damn near impossible.  I believe 
 metro will be running a shuttle from open lots in downtown which are probably 
 about 10 blocks away from the park.  There are several of these lots around 
 the Enron building and Smith and Lousiana St.  Might be worth checking the 
 either the Metro web site or the Enron Field web site to get exact details on 
 the Shuttle routes.  I believe the shuttle will drop off directly in front of 
 the park.
 
 I received the Nemec Family Reunion flyer recently.  Looks like your whole 
 family got drafted into service this year.  I guess thats a danger of showing 
 up at those things.  
 
 Take care and we'll talk to you later.
 
 
 
 
 
 


    
 
 Hey Gerald how are things going?
 
 I need your expertise...(scary isn't it).
 
 With the baseball season approaching, I am looking for recommendations on
 where to park downtown.  Do you know of any parking garages that are
 somewhat close and are charging $5-$10?
 
 Please advise.  Thanks!
