 
 Glad to hear the dogs are ok.  But  I knew they would be, its you that has to 
 make the real adjustment.    I took Ellen Wallumrod, (she is new on the 
 confirm desk),  Allison McHenry / Marianne Castano (from EES I gave my 
 invitation to them) and Genia.    I had trouble trying to find someone who 
 wanted to go. 
 
 Take care, enjoy being away.
