 been trying to get a better grasp of the deal flow in Brazil through some 
 type of "Deal Report".  In Houston and Argentina, the business groups 
 circulate a transaction listing.  Also, legal in both Houston and Argentina 
 circulate a listing from Legal's perspective. Is a commercial team deal 
 report circulated weekly in Brazil, and if so, can I be added to the 
 circulation?  I will ask Randy if he can circulate his list.  It would be 
 helpful for me when we have our weekly conference call.  In that regard, what 
 is "Alcan", the PPA which may eventually serve as a template?  I am glad to 
 prepare some type of module as Randy suggested which sets forth basic Enron 
 Corp. and/or trading policy as to certain issues (force majeure, governing 
 law, dispute resolution, damages, etc.),  Let's coordinate for the seminar 
 which you are organizing for March.  Thanks.  Sara
