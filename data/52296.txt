 
 Brian,
 
 See you at Cabo.

 I drove in today and parked in the lot in front of Cabo's (a block from the theater).  I'll see you there!
 
  
     
 Brian,
 
 What about meeting around 5:50 - 6:00 p.m. at the Angelica Movie Center
 on Smith. There is an underground parking between Smith and Louisiana
 and the movie theater will validate your parking ticket.
 
 There are several bars at the center.
 
 The movie starts at 7:00 with some boring speeches. Saturday should be more
 interesting - it's a comedy day.
