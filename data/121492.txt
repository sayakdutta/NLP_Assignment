 
 Jeff, 
 
 Attached is the latest Palo Alto document with their red lined comments.  I haven't had a chance to look at them yet but will right now.  
 
 Thanks,

 Kim,
 
 Here are our changes to the NGSA.  Are we on for this afternoon at 2:00 p.m.
 our time?  I'll call you to confirm.

 Monica and Karla:
 
 The attached draft Natural Gas Services Agreement contains the remainder of
 my suggested revisions to the document, beginning with Article 12 (where I
 stopped renumbering!).  There are no additional changes to the redlined
 portion of the draft (Articles 1 thru 9) I sent yesterday.
 
 
 Let me know as soon as you find out about the time scheduled for the
 conference call with Enron.
 Thanks.
