 
 Hi Mum!  If you want to come to Houston for the July 8 art crawl, that would 
 be fun.  I plan to meet more of the gallery owners and talk to them about 
 what they do.  Who knows, having my own gallery might actually become part of 
 my long-range plan.  If not, I will have met some interesting people.
 
 If you want to come to Houston sooner, I do not have much going on after my 
 Sat. a.m. class at Rice, although I do have to catch a plane to D.C. on 
 Monday morning.
 
 The week is going OK.  All the tennis and swimming has left me with sore 
 muscles so this is my night off.  Am planning to do some more house chores so 
 I do not end up with another weekend like the last.
 
 I'm still planning on coming to Austin next weekend, I'm just not sure when, 
 but I'll let you know.
 
 Call if you get lonely! 
 
 Love,
 Sooz
 
 
 
 

   
  
 
 Hi, Sooz,
 
 Got home about 1 p.m. today and can already feel my mood sinking--not ready
 to get back into my solo mode.
 
 Enjoyed being with the little bugaroo--even with the diarrhea, she was in a
 good mood with the exception of an occasional sore bottom.  She smiles all
 the time.  It does wear me out considerably when I have her all day long
 though, and, especially this time, when I was tired from our trip and Eric's
 visit.
 
 I must think about a trip to Houston.  Are you aware of the big Houston art
 day in the galleries on July 8th?  Just caught a glimpse of it when thumbing
 through the new SW Art Mag.  I'll track it down and give you the particulars.
  (You'll have to review your travel schedule with me again.)
 
 Hope you're having a good week.  love, Mum
