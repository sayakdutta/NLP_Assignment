 Gary - for the time being would you work with George Marshall to send myself and Jodie Floyd an email if he identifies a potential EFM problem on the NNG north or south end.    We will log the ticket as a "Hot Seat" entry.   He will need to give us a little description - meter number and the tech's name and location for the log entry purposes.  You can see that Mike wants to document and track all EFM issues and would like himself and his Directors to be aware of the problems that could affect the customer's measurement and affect UAF & PPAs.   As we originally discussed,  this can only be done if all EFM problems are funneled through the Measurement Desk.
 
 By following such a process we can log and track the ticket to resolution when the volumes are correct in GMS.  George does all the database work and most of the notification of measurement problems.   We don't want to duplicate efforts while George is still here but we need to get the issues tracked in the log that will be sent to NNG & Market Services Management,  Measurement Specialist,  Measurement Operations, NNG Marketing,  Gas Control IT  &  NNG Field Operations. 
 
 George does a great job and we are doing our best to not disrupt his daily routine by duplicating efforts but we need him to keep us in the loop on potential measurement issues on any NNG station, north or south.    If we need to follow up on the status of volumetric issues we will contact the Tech.   It would be good if George would give us updates on physical/software repairs.   Angela has set him up to get into the NNG Measurement Log and he could make his own NNG entries & updates early in the morning before Jodie arrives at 7 AM..   That is up to him.  He can actually get in the log anytime he wants by letting Jodie know he wants to make entries.   I was told that George would be retiring the end of the year.  Once George retires then we will start doing the notifications on the NNG EFM custody transfer collection issues.  But in the mean time we need some help to make this NNG EFM effort work.
 
 Tks - Mike W.
 
   
     
 
 I am working with Robert Travers to coordinate a demo of the Teamshare software. Hoping for a demo next week. I will also be coordinating with the Corp Remedy support group for another demo from them. That way everyone will have seen both solutions and we can make a call on the right product to move forward with.
 
 Thanks, Gary

 Mike,   our objective is to send the log out weekly.   Right now most of the activity in the log is being generated Enron internally by our proactive approach,  NNG Gas Control, NNG IT, Schedulers and Marketing folks.   Rick Dietz will be sending out an internal communication announcing the official formation of the NNG Measurement Desk within Gas Logistics later on this week.    An external message will follow.   Once the external customers are made formally aware of the desk and the number is published we will pick up a lot more activity on potential measurement issues.   I would like to send out the log weekly to Shelley, yourself, Rick Dietz, the Directors, Measurement Specialist, Field Operation Teams, GMS, NNG Gas Control IT,  and anyone else that should be in the loop.   I will be sending the log out for the first time this week.
 
 We also believe that we will have much more problem identification with a network trouble tracking system is in place that is web based and interactive.    Once we have a better trouble tracking tool than our current Excel spreadsheet log we will be able to be much more proactive with the help we will receive from the IT "Hot Seat" and GMS.    The "Hot Seat",  within Gas Control,  will soon be a 24 hour function so they will be monitoring many of the EFM scanning functions & telemetry and in a position to give us a "heads up" of potential measurement issues that we will troubleshoot and track to resolution.  GMS will also be able to access the log and make entries that they believe are significant measurement issues. 
 
 Mike, you can count on our continued commitment to work with your field operations personnel, Gas Control IT, Field Measurement Services, and GMS to minimize measurement issues and reduce UAF.

 Measurement Desk - During July 12 - 19....NNG logged 13 SCADA and/or EFM measurement issues / inquiries of which 11 have been closed. 
 
 Is there a way I, or the region Directors could see the log, who was contacted, etc?
