 for tax. I suggest you intervene immediately.

 Rob, I just received a copy of a DASH asking for an increase on the letter of 
 credit that is provided for the Cuiaba I project diesel fuel supply.  That 
 DASH states that Shell has not agreed to participate in the cost of the 
 letter of credit and as a result that Enron is entitled to charge  Shell 
 Libor plus 4 % per annum on Shell's share of the guarantee under the terms of 
 a letter agreement between Shell Cuiaba Holdings Ltd. and Enron. 
 
 Has this been put into effect?  We are sensitive to this because we may have 
 IRS transfer pricing issues with respect to guarantees that Enron makes on 
 loans to its various project entities.
 
 The last time I had talked was to Joanna back in late September/October and 
 she said it had not been put into effect.
 
 Regards,
 
 Rick
