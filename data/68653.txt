 months and walking and talking up a storm.  Definitely keeping us on our 
 toes.  The program for people with Graduate degrees is the associate 
 program.  The person to contact that is responsible for that program is 
 Kristin Gandy, her number is  713-345-3214.  I have no idea what all the 
 requirements are and when they recruit.  What type of position is he 
 interested in - Treasury?  I have some friends down in Treasury that I may be 
 able to pass the resume on if you guys would like.  Oil and Gas experience is 
 not a necessity, just a plus.  Enron really encourages diversity in every 
 form, even experience.  By far the best company I have ever worked for.

 Hey. How is everything going with you all?  Things are pretty good here.
 Expecting a second baby in March.  Pretty excited. How are Ashly and
 Jackson? Good I hope.  What is Jackson now, almost 2?  I bet he's alot of
 fun.  I was also writing to ask you if you know anything about the program
 Enron has for people with graduate degrees. Chris is furiously looking for
 a new job and was just curious about that program that he saw on the Enron
 web site.  I was also going to ask you if you knew of any positions there
 that might suit Chris' qualifications.  Alot of what he sees on the web is
 looking for alot of engineering or Oil & Gas experience.  I told him you
 might have an inside track on some things there and that I would check with
 you.  I am attaching his resume for you to look at.  If you know of
 anything, please give me a call or e-mail me. I would certainly appreciate
 it.  Take care and keep in touch.
