 What did today's look like?  Do we still have the same problems in power?

 Current open items are:
 
 Weather - looks like there are still probs bringing this stuff in.  Ramesh, would you have time to work with Todd and see if you can track down the problem?
 Freight exotic - this hasn't been officialized for days - what's the status here?
 Gas - they are still working to officialize the 12ths (should be done by 10 am this am) and then will do the 13th - there were problems deleting the interdesk transactions.  Jeff will let me know when they are done and we can rerun VAR/credit.
 Power - a few EPMI books showed up.
 Lumber - I probably need to reload the 12ths, but waiting on confirmation.
 Liquids - a few exotics books showed up as well as 1 UK book that has been officialized in the recent past, I'm not sure of the status of these going forward.
 
  
 
 Thanks
