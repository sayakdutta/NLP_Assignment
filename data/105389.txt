 Susan Bailey (Ext. 34737) contact Morgan to alert them that the faxed docs 
 are coming.  We also will need a signature on the agreement itself and I 
 can't recall if Marie sent that already.  Please call Susan so that we can be 
 more specific about what might happen today (and whether it can wait until 
 Monday morning when Marie returns).  I have not received anything from 
 Robert.  Thanks.  Sara
