 
 Attached is the referenced list, with the following comments:
 
 1.  BC Gas Utility Ltd. was added as an amended counterparty by me.  We got 
 the financial master in place with them so we are opening them up for all 
 financial.
 2.  Ferrell North America - we have a financial master in place with 
 Ferrellgas, L.P., d/b/a Ferrell North America.  That should be the name that 
 goes out on the confirm.
 
 All the counterparties on today's list are shut down for power.
