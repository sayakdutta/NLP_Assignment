 
 Carl,
 
 Although both dates will most likely work for me, I would prefer choice # 1:  Nov 13th in the morning.  Thanks.

 There are a growing number of things for us to discuss relative to gas
 supply for Pleasant Valley Station.  I would like to suggest the following
 dates to meet in Houston.
 
 Choice #1:	November 13, a morning meeting
 
 Choice #2:	Novemer 6, a morning meeting
 
 Please let me know (and reply all in your response) if one or both dates
 work.
 
 I will put together an agenda of the items for discussion.
