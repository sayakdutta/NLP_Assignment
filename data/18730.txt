 accounting to send it.  Suggestions?  I think that Bowen & Co. could likely 
 help us out on this first filing.  Also, Sue, regarding NY:  I have a call 
 into Bowen but when I called they sounded pretty tied up.  Haven't heard back 
 yet.

 Hi Jeff,
 
 I just saw the fax regarding the quarterly fee statement for reimbursement 
 account for California.  Do you know if there is someone in accounting who 
 has the document and who has responsibility for taking care of it?  Thanks,
 
 Sue
