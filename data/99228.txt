 Mark, fyi
 Paul J is away sick but asked me to deal with this.  I have also discussed with Paul S.  Conference call planned for 2pm today with Andy Edison to discuss this (and Kemper).
  
 
    Cc: Sanders, Richard B.; Edison, Andrew
   
 Let's keep the pressure up by all means but I understand that an extension of this period is not hard to come by. 
  
 I assume you're talking about that with Andy, Paul J.

 REQUEST FOR LEGAL ADVICE
  
 Thank you for the written advice. Obviously prospects of success assessed at "[no] more than 50%..." (ie. definitely less than 50%) is depressing, given initial expectations. We now need to maximise our bargaining power for acquisition of the smelter through the litigation which McCook have forced on us. 
  
 We look forward to receiving the draft Defence and Counterclaim for comments/approval. We will need this fairly urgently, since the 20 day period for service expires next Monday, 17 Sept 2001 (according to my calculations - please confirm). Can you please ensure that they are sent to all the copy parties on the email (now including Houston litigation dept). Thank you.

 All:  Attached is our follow-up memorandum regarding the merits of Enron's claim to enforce the Tolling Agreement against Longview.  Please feel free to contact either Rick or me if you have any questions.
