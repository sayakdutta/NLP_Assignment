 Pool (not the east pool)
 
 Thanks,

 Take a look at what's in DRAFT and if it looks okay I'll activate the Product.

 I am trying to create the WkD for other areas beside HPL/HSX E but keep 
 getting an error msg for length.   Is there a way to truncate these products 
 so that we can trade them on eol?  
 
 Thanks,
