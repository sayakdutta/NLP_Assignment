 Michelle and Sharon,
 
 We are trying to track down a contract on Barbara Paige.  Executive Compensation said they did not receive a copy.  Can either one of you help us locate a copy?

 Pam,
 
 I looked in the Compensation Database to check on this for Sheila but there is no contract info in the system for Barbara Paige.  Can Dana check into this for us and let us know if she can locate the contract?  
 
 Thanks!

 Sheila,
 
 My contract calls for a salary increase after one year (June 12, 2001).  That has not yet taken effect. What do I need to do?
 
 Barbara
