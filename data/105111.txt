 Heard"!  Could this be true or do I have a virus?  SS

 Mark and I met yesterday.  I am NOT making my proposed changes to either 
 Section 2 or Section 8 of the Omnibus other than adding definitions for  
 "Option" and "Floor Amount" to Section 8.  This does not interfere with all 
 of our other general changes to Annex A (which include the comment about 
 "Total Premium" which should conform to the online version).  So, Annex A is 
 ready to go!  Sara
