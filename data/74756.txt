 Regarding the Escrow Agreement, I reviewed the revised Agreement that was 
 e-mailed to us on May 30 by Marisa and confirmed that she made the 
 appropriate changes regarding Northwestern Generation I, LLC being the 
 depositor of the escrowed funds and would pay the escrow fees, investment 
 transaction fees and reimbursements for expenses made by Escrow Agent...

 Kay:
 
 The Escrow Agreement that is attached appears to be in final form and
 contains all of the changes that we requested.  As a result, will you
 overnight the sig pages and the incumbency certificate to Tremaine Wright?
 If you prefer, you can courier the documents to my attention, and I can
 coordinate getting them to Paul Hastings.  Tremaine needs 3 sig pages and 1
 incumbency certificate.  Thanks.
 
 Regards,
 
 Marisa
