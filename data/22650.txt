 During our off-site at Columbia Lakes recently,  we identified areas in ENA 
 where significant gaps exist that need filling at the Analyst and Associate 
 level.  We have scheduled an off-cycle Super Saturday on June 3, 2000 and I 
 would like your participation as an interviewer.  We will need approximately  
 25-30 interviewers to fill approximately 30 Associate & Analyst positions.  I 
 am counting on everyone making themselves available on the third to 
 facilitate this priority action item.
 
 Ted Bland will be forwarding information concerning the event to each of you 
 early next week.  
 
 Thank you for your participation.  
 
 Dave
