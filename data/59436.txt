 Here are the curves loaded for East, Texas, West and Central on November 30th.  They are also saved in O:\_Dropbox\Kam\Nov 30 Curves if you need to make any changes.
 I left a copy of all broker quotes from that day on your desk.
 
 All broker quotes are saved in O:\erms\1intra\broker quotes.  Here are a few samples.
       
 
 
 
 
 
 These are the curves for each region....basis, index, gas daily & physical.

 Can you get a list of all curves together for 11/30.  And any sample broker quotes that we may have.  ( I hope we are saving them at this point.)
 
 Thanks
