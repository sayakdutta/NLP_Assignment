 Edison Says Banks Put Off Credit Remedies to Feb. 13 (Update4)
 
      (Adds background on missed payments in fourth paragraph,
 power alert in seventh paragraph, auction in eighth paragraph. For

      Rosemead, California, Jan. 24 (Bloomberg) -- Southern
 California Edison Co.'s banks agreed to delay taking action
 against the utility until at least Feb. 13 for defaulting on lines
 of credit, an executive of its parent company said.
      ``The banks have agreed to forbear'' through that date, Ted
 Craver, Edison International's chief financial officer, said in a
 conference call with investors.
      The group of 23 banks have the right to demand accelerated
 payments or seek other remedies after Southern California Edison,
 California's second-largest utility, failed to make $230 million
 of payments on maturing notes last week. That produced a ``cross-
 default'' on its lines of credit.
      Both the utility and PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric
 defaulted last week on commercial paper, a type of money-market
 security. In addition, Southern California Edison failed to pay
 $366 million to power generators.
      The two utilities have piled up more than $11.5 billion in
 power-buying debt because rising demand and short supplies have
 driven up the price they pay, and the state's deregulation law
 caps the rates they can charge customers.
      For more than a week, the California Independent System
 Operator has kept its highest alert in place. The Stage Three
 alert is imposed by the ISO, which runs three-quarters of the
 state's power grid, when reserves fall to within 1.5 percent
 of demand.
 
                       Bankruptcy Outlook
 
      The state is now running an auction to solicit bids for
 multiyear power contracts on behalf of the utilities. Producers
 can submit offers in the auction, which ends at noon California
 time, to sell power for as long as 10 years.
      Meanwhile, Southern California Edison and the banks are
 getting the final paperwork ``mopped up'' on the forbearance
 agreement, Craver said in yesterday's conference call.
      The utility doesn't intend to file for bankruptcy, Craver
 said. ``We do not believe that solves anything,'' he said, as it
 doesn't change the need for political and regulatory action to
 address the utility's cash crunch.
      ``That's why we instituted this additional step of the
 temporary payment suspension,'' Craver said. ``We believe we're in
 a position to operate the business without running out of cash''
 for at least three weeks, he said. He described the utility's net
 cash flow as ``at least breakeven'' after the payment suspensions.
      Craver was asked during the teleconference about the chances
 that power generators or other creditors might force the utility
 into an involuntary bankruptcy.
 
                           Making Progress
 
      Generators are aware of the ``not-so-subtle threats that
 bubble about'' regarding the state using eminent domain to take
 control of power plants or contracts. ``It's in everybody's best
 interest'' to find a way out that avoids bankruptcy, Craver said.
 ``That's the way everybody's operating.''
      California Governor Gray Davis and state lawmakers are
 working on potential solutions, including locking in long-term
 power contracts, to help keep the two utilities from bankruptcy.
 The state's Department of Water Resources has an initial stake of
 $400 million to buy electricity for the utilities.
      ``We're continuing to make progress and it's encouraging
 that's being recognized,'' said Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for
 Davis.
      ``There is now a very great deal of urgency'' among state
 leaders to develop a comprehensive framework of solutions, Robert
 Foster, Edison's senior vice president of public affairs, said
 during the conference call.
      A framework may be in place by Feb. 1, Foster said. ``I
 haven't seen anything quite this intense in 30 years'' in the
 state capital, he added.
 
                          Paying the Bills
 
      Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg is working on a bill that
 calls for Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric to
 give up hydroelectric plants. In exchange, the state would sell
 revenue bonds that repay past spending and finance power purchases
 on their behalf.
      ``I don't think at this point we're really able to respond''
 to that proposal without more details, Craver said. In response to
 a question on the transfer of hydroelectric plants, utility
 officials said the issues would include secured bondholders' liens
 on Edison's assets.
      Utility officials said they have also been asked about who
 will repay the $400 million of initial state spending on power
 purchases.
      Based on the legislative intent, it is Edison's understanding
 ``that this power be paid for directly by the customers, not the
 utilities,'' Stephen Pickett, vice president and general counsel
 of Southern California Edison, said during the teleconference.
      ``It is not completely clear that that is the case,'' Pickett
 said.
      Craver also stressed that Edison, the parent of the utility,
 hasn't gone into default on its obligations. ``We're not having
 difficulty meeting our obligations,'' he said, and its cash is
 about twice the amount of commercial paper outstanding.
