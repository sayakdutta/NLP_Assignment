 credit worksheet, I can spin a draft over to you.  Sara

 Sara:  If the PacifiCorp ISDA we discussed last week is in or through the 
 hopper, will you please forward a copy to me?  The guys on the floor would 
 like to pull together a form of confirm that they can show to PacifiCorp when 
 they meet with them later this week.  The date hasn't yet been set, but it 
 could be in a few days.
 
 I hope you had a good weekend.
 
 Perhaps we can talk tomorrow.
 
 Thanks.
