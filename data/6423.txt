 
 alright then anderson rather than watters
 
 
 
 

    
 
 I am happy with my Tight End and Garner has proven less valuable than
 Watters thus far this season.

 Eric,
 
 Let me know if I have Anderson or not.  If I have Morton I want to pick him
 up and drop my other kicker.  If I don't have Morton do the same thing
 except pick Hanson up instead of Anderson
