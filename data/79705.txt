 
 CP,
 Please send on and co-ordinate a 30 minute meeting with Jeff McMahon and Ray 
 Bowen for discussion.  They might be able to use him as well.
 Thanks,

 Mike,
 
 Per our conversation yesterday, attached is a brief work history.  If anyone
 has any questions or wants more information, tell them to feel free to call me
 next week.  I can most easily be reached during the day at 713-267-4192 or on
 my cell phone at 713-817-7624.  Looking forward to seeing you on the 6th.
 
 Neal
