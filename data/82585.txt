 
 Kenny, is there a fee for reserving Tom Bass Park?  If so, how much and are we going to split the cost?
 
 I believe that I will have approximately 15 guests..
 
 Tasha & her family----4 people ( 2 kids)
 Hope & family  ---  4 people (1 child)
 Me and My family -- 4 people (2 kids)
 Ora & family --- 3 people ( no kids)
 Angie - possible 3 to 4 people (possible 2 kids)
 Todd's friends from Dynegy - (2 adults)
 
 
  
     
 
 Not as many as we originally thought, Sandie is calling folks the next
 couple of days.  We invited about 5-6 families/friends, Marsha maybe
 invited about the same. I know Todd had a couple of DYN folks.   When its
 all said and done we may have about 40 people including kids.  I'll know
 for sure Friday.  Mom and Jackie will be down that weekend so they will be
 there.
