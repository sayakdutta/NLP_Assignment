 made to the pro forma sheets we've filed, and will get back to you.
 
 
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
   
  
 I talked to Lindy last Friday,  let us know when or if we need to discuss 
 further--  
 Manual processes can still work--I think

 In discussing the finer points of EFBH Service with our market services 
 people, an issue has arisen with respect to allocation of FTS-1 and FTS-3 
 capacity.  We are going to have to be able to put FTS-3 and FTS-1 capacity 
 into separate buckets for purposes of allocation (that is, allocation due to 
 circumstances such as, say, windowing by SoCal, &c.).  Here's why.  If 
 capacity became constrained on a given day and we allocated FTS-3 and FTS-1 
 together, FTS-1 service would essentially be enjoying the use of capacity 
 created by EFBH.  This is all well and good until EFBH cancels at the last 
 minute. Then you know what would happen:  FTS-1 would get cut because EFBH 
 cancelled.  I am told that this would necessarily happen because once FTS 
 schedules, it gets flowing gas rights.  To keep this scenario from happening, 
 we feel that FTS-3 will have to be put in its own bucket and not get cut 
 unless EFBH doesn't show up.
 
 Obviously, there is more to it than this, and Lindy and I would like to 
 discuss it with you.  The systems people can't continue their work until we 
 get this resolved.  Can we discuss this on Monday or some other time next 
 week?  
 
 Thanks, 
 SS
