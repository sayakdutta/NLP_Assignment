 I wanted to ask you guys, if you know of any jobs that Nicki Daw could do, she would like to stay in Houston for a while longer,  I know she won't ask you herself as she did leave on the 31st December, but if we can get her a job maybe her employment could be reinstated and last week could be vacation.  If you know of anyone looking for a brillant assistant or someone needing some to coordinate a project, please put in a word. Nicki is in the office today and will be in Houston for about three more weeks.
 
 Thanks
 
 Sue
