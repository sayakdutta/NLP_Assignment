 Hope all's well and Edison's paying you.  
 
 Please be absolutely sure in the future to email or phone me with a head's up 
 on filings like these in California prior to filing.
 
 As you know, it's crazy in California, with a lot flying around in numerous 
 forums.  Even Ken Lay's frequently been to California over the past couple of 
 months trying to educate and advocate rational, detailed solutions.  Want to 
 make absolutely sure that we don't step on each other in our many attempts to 
 get this ridiculous state back on track.
 
 Not trying to slow you down, or dictate content; rather, given the 
 high-stakes nature of the California situation, coordination is critical.  
 Thanks much.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
