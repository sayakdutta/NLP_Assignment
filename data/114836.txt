 
 Thank you! 
 
 The itemization was absolutely no problem, and please let me know when I can 
 do things like that to make your job go more smoothly. I know the market got 
 chaotic late yesterday; so I probably could have assumed that our net 
 position would be off today and at least one other person would know that. 
 But it seems that in this business, assumption can cause a small problem to 
 breed and multiply into one of mammoth proportions down the line. So I 
 thought I'd ask. In the future, is it you I should come to, or real time?
 
 Thanks again for your help.
