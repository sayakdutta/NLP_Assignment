 
 George, what is that status of this?  Kinder hasn't called on this but 
 probably will.  Let's discuss or leave me an email.
 thanks,

 I left you a voice mail regarding Sempra and Kinder Morgan.  Details as 
 follows:
 
 We will make a revised settlement offer to Sempra by the end of this week.  I 
 doubt that Sempra will accept our offer.  If they fail to accept, we will 
 head into a litigation track - which means no synfuel will be produced at 
 Pier IX until the court decides on who wins the case.  We expect the case to 
 go to court in the fourth quarter of this year.
 
 As I previously advised, Kinder Morgan has been very patient with us during 
 this process.  At some point in time we will have to address their claims, 
 which by definition will have to go through us in order to reach Sempra.
 
 Let me know if I can provide any additional information.
 
 George
