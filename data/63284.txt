 in turn, pass it on to whoever they deal with in Maintenance.  It has been at 
 least 3 times.

 Mr. Lay, we are looking into the problem and hope to have the problem 
 resolved ASAP. Thanks
 P.S. Our best to you and your family this Thanksgiving.

 Gary, 
 Least I forget!  On N5737 the other day (11/18) Mr. Lay reported to Bill 
 Reddick that when his phone (#2 R/H seat) rings and he answers that it 
 disconnects on him.  He told Bill that this is the third time he has reported 
 this problem.  I spoke personally with Bill about this.  We checked and there 
 is no record of this problem reported recently (we checked back to May 2000) 
 on all three Falcon 900's.
 
 Lyndel checked the system and there does seem to be a problem with it 
 disconnecting if you pick it up before the third ring.  After the third ring 
 it works fine.  That is all I know at this time.  Garrett Av is coming over 
 today to check the system.
 
 I know you don't like emails but I didn't want this it slip by.  I've 
 discussed this with Ron and John as well.
 
 Keith
