     I apologize for not getting this to you earlier.  This is a draft of a
 license under which Enron Networks could disclose its data formats.  It is
 very basic, but I think covers the points that we discussed last week.
 
     I will be out of town on vacation, starting tomorrow.  But I have
 briefed Rasmani Bhattacharya, an attorney at V&E who works with me on this
 types of projects, and she can make any amendments or changes that may be
 necessary.  You can reach Rasmani at 713 758-2109.
 
     I have left some questions in the form, which need to be addressed and
 edited.  Also, we should ask Jay what we should call these formats.  I just
 made up a term.  He will be able to come up with a better one, I am sure.
 
     Rasmani, you should have rights to this document, but if there is some
 problem, just save it as a new document and go from there.  The iManage
 number is 599547.  Also, please feel free to expand and clarify the
 disclaimers and limits of the license.  Also, would you get with Tony Chan
 and go over this draft with him.  I based this draft in large part on what
 he gave me.  Thanks.
