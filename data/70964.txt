 
 This may sound like a silly question, but why?  Is this something Ben wants 
 Matt doing? 
 
 1-4 are all the CO's I know about.
 
 I'm out today, but we can discuss it tomorrow, and I can explain my point of 
 view.

 Have you had a chance to collect the following information for Matt Tezyk:
 
 The free storage letter from GE
 Any correspondence between GE and you relating to all 24 turbines
 Any change orders in addition to #1-4
 Documentation on any other deals we have made with GE
 
 Please let me know if I can help with this.  If possible, I'd like to get 
 this information to Matt some time early this week.
 
 Regards,
 Rebecca
