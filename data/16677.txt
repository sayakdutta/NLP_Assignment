 Greetings:
 
 The CPUC held an emergency meeting this morning in which they restated the 
 utilities obligation to serve regardless of claims of bankruptcy or any other 
 insolvency. PG&E had indicated to both the ISO and CDWR that they had only 
 planned to schedule for load in which they had native generation to serve. 
 PG&E's logic is?probably that they will cover folks with the?assets they 
 have, but since they can't buy anything, they shouldn't?carry that 
 obligation.? CPUC doesn't like that logic, although if bankruptcy happens its 
 about the same effect?as?imposing that obligation on DWR.? This could be 
 avoided if they would just impose the rate increase?that will cover the 
 costs, subject to refund, and then get the long-term?deals in place.? At this 
 point the utilities have?much less to lose.? Please find the attached 
 decision.? For those of you who would like to listen to the hearing you can 
 listen to a rebroadcast by logging onto the CPUC web site.
