 trading system that is being built and the legal review of various pieces of 
 the system.  If you haven't been involved yet, it probably means that 
 somebody else (maybe Wayne, Harry or Janice?) is responsible for the 
 commodities you handle.  The project is only confidential in that we're 
 trying to minimize information outside of Enron about it.  There's no problem 
 talking about it internally.  You're certainly welcome to attend if you want 
 to find out more about it, but if somebody else in your group is already 
 covering things, you don't need to worry about it.

 I have a meeting at 10:00 am that could interfere with the presentation, but 
 I won't know for sure until I see how long the meeting lasts. It has been 
 difficult to schedule and the originators are very anxious that it take 
 place, so I don't think I can cancel it. I confess I don't understand what 
 the presentation is about, and your message did not make sense to me. Perhaps 
 because I have not been involved in trading transactions. Can you give me a 
 clue without breaching the confidential nature of the project/demonstration?
