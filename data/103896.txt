 
 All trades were originally confirmed in the name of Dow Hydrocarbons and 
 Resources Inc.  The Dow trader (Mike Blillings) subsequently contacted the 
 desk and requested that all trades be booked in the name of "The Dow Chemical 
 Company".  Mary Gosnell contacted Cathy Tudon in credit and Cathy approved 
 the changes.  Let me know if you have any comment for the desk.  SS

 Mary, please see my initial findings below, and can you follow-up with Sara - 
 as I am sure there is some history here.

 ECT does NOT have a master with The Dow Chemical Company.  Are these trades 
 booked on an omnibus?  I am not certain that credit approved these trades.  
 Are they all propane?  We need to discuss.  SS
