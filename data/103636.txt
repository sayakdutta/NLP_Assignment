 We should keep Lotus Notes updated.  Thanks.  Sara

 I refer to our recent conversation relating to the progress of ISDA 
 negotiations with the above counterparty.
 
 I have just spoken to Carine Lavergne at SITA.  She informs me that SITA does 
 not feel adequately equipped or informed to progress the negotiations 
 internally and therefore intends to appoint external counsel (I urged her to 
 do this as soon as possible).  Despite this intended appointment, she assured 
 me that SITA wishes to enter into the ISDA as soon as possible and is keen to 
 keep negotiations to a minimum.
 
 Either I or Michael Khajeh-Noori will keep you updated as to the progress.
 
 For your information, I also attach a status report with respect to the 
 counterparties with whom Michael and I are currently negotiating.
 
 
 
 Let me know if you need anything else.
 
 Regards
 Deepak
