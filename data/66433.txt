 
 yeah.  just go ahead and do that.  how about the houstonian?  youre  the best.
 
  
     
 no problem.  instead of a golf allowance though, i think i'll just get you a
 membership somewhere.  wouldn't that be better?  just let me know so i can
 arrange it.
 
 
     
 
 sweet.  i need a golf allowance then.   i can drink beer every night and
 golf all day while you work.  that would be so sweet of you.  i cant wait
 to do that.
 
     
                 
    you don't need to work at denny's.  you know, i make a lot of money,
    more
    than i can spend, so there's really no reason why you can't just live
    off of
    my salary for a while.  shouldn't be a problem, i usually just give half
    of
    it away to charity anyway.
 
    
                Subject:
 
 
    looks like i am going to work at denny's. stock is down about another
    2.50.
