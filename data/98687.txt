 Should I suggest that he get in touch with you or Bonnie?

 Mr. Cheek:
 I got your e-mail address out of Martindale.  I need to set up a corporate
 rep depo to get information concerning an employee of Enron Capital and
 Trade who lives in Dallas and offices in Houston.  Could you refer me to
 whoever in your office would handle that, so I can set it up with a minimum
 of inconvenience to all concerned?
 Thanks,
 Bart Wulff
