 she doesn't hear from them by tomorrow morning, can Cara and I have a 
 conference call with you at 11:00 a.m. Pacific time so you can birddog people 
 and get some answers?  In the meantime, if Cara E-mailed you the questions, 
 would you answer any you know the answers to. Thanks.

 I have gotten these documents from Tim, Val, and now you.  I have tried to 
 get in touch with Linda Lawrence and Kelly Hutley, no answer from either of 
 them.  I don't understand what I am looking at, and am not even really sure 
 what I am supposed to do with it, aside from giving it my blessing.
 
 Until I get a response, I can't give my 'blessing'

 Did Tim already send you these documents for your review?  If he did, have 
 you been working with the Houston group on them or do you want to tell me 
 about any problems?

 There was no Mexico activity for the Fourth Quarter of 2000.
 Please let me know if you all have any questions or comments regarding any of 
 the reports.
 Thank you
