 pretty cool.  I thought you could lend a hand.  (John Montcrief also does wet 
 shipping for the crude and products group in London and works for Nowlan as 
 well.)  It looks pretty interesting.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks....

 I called this guy back and he introduced himself to me and in the same 
 breath, told me he had ''forgotten more about freight this week than that 
 French guy in London will ever know!''  I didn't allude that I knew the 
 French guy.  I'm looking forward to the freight cat-fight... be sure to call 
 me when it happens so I don't miss any of the biting or hair-pulling!
