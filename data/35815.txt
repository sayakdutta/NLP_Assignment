 Jerry's on July 4th.  Had a good time.  He does a good job cooking on his BBQ 
 pit.  I was very tired on Wed though.

 I try and negotiate that for you.  Also, I think you need to think about
 sharing custody of your son since you will be so close.

 Not hardly.  Will she buy me some toys - a motorcycle, let me get my flying
 licenses, and a cheaper 4 wheel drive vehicle?  I will also need to travel
 back to Texas once a quarter to vist my family.

 Hey I think that if you loose 50 lbs, I can make it happen for you.  But
 you
 might have to move to Denver.  Is that a problem?
