 
 Can one of you make sure LT-SERC is still an active book (if not, have it reactivated) and coordinate with TJae regarding the EOL ID.  John may still be set up in EnPower, I am not sure that his access was ever taken away, but we need to have his trader ID attached to LT-SERC.
 
 Let me know if you have any questions.

 Stacey/TJ:
 
 I need to be setup on EOL with the appropriate book for  SOCO (EPMI-LT-SERC?).  I start on Monday Oct. 29th.
 
 Let me know if you need additional information.
 
 Thanks.
