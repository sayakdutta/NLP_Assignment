 Vince,
 Kevin Hannon is the executive lead for Cornell and he needs to approve.   I 
 am not sure if they have already interviewed on campus.  He should go through 
 the on-campus screening process before attending a Super Saturday.  We are 
 reserving the Super Saturday weekend for individuals that are highly likely 
 to receive an offer.  I will forward this to Kevin and Kristin Gandy.  
 Although they are responsible for Graduate recruiting at Cornell, perhaps it 
 is possible for him to interview when they go on campus.
 Charlene
 
 Kevin and Kristin,
 Please see Vince's message below. Would it be possible for an undergraduate 
 to interview while you are at Cornell?  Please let me know.  
 
 Thanks

 Charlene,
 
 Please, help. This is a son of a professor at Berkeley who helps me a lot in 
 the recruiting process.
 His son goes to Cornell. Can we invite him (the son, not the professor) to a 
 Super Saturday? I really want
 to repay the debt to his father who is very instrumental in  my recruiting 
 efforts.
 
 Vince
