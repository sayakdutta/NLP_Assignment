 
 Rebecca,
 
 Philippe being the only other corp officer within the large technology 
 organization has an enormous volume of contracts to sign.  A large bulk of 
 the signatures that are required come from two areas;  Infrastructure and 
 ENA.  I would like to have 2 current Vice Presidents within the business 
 units made corp VPs:  Beth Pearlman and Jenny Rub.
 
 Can we make this happen and when would it occur?
 
 Thanks,
 Mike
