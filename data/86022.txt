I don't know the specific requirements for filing.  You might want to do some net research on the subject.  I would think the Fed. Government would have a web site on how to copyright material.  Hope this helps.
 
 
  
     
 Hey Gerald,
 
 I was wondering if you can answer a question for me.  If you can't, no problem...
 
 I recently completed a paper that compares electric compression to gas-fired compression.  I am presenting that paper next week at the Gas Machinery Research Council Annual Conference and Seminar.   I plan on submitting the paper to several industry journals in the hopes of getting it published.
 
 How do I make sure the paper is protected from being copied by someone else and submitted under their own name?  Can I copyright the paper?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Andrew
