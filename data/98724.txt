 Aleck --
 
 I have not yet been paid for the work I did for Enron via Blakes.  I
 sent Blakes an invoice for about US$20,000 early in August -- yes,
 almost 5 months ago -- and have received nothing since.  I have asked
 Web MacDonald several times to check on it.  The last response I heard
 from Blakes was over a month ago, when they said they would remind
 Enron.  Then, about three weeks ago, I was asked by an attorney in San
 Francisco to assist him with some Enron work related to California.  I
 told him that, in my experience, Enron does not pay its bills, so he
 offered me an advance retainer.  He also said he had checked with the
 appropriate person at Enron in Houston, who said that he had just
 approved payment of my invoice.  But that was over three weeks ago and I
 still have seen nothing.
 
 My letter agreement is with Blakes, not Enron, so I had assumed that
 Blakes would pay me and invoice Enron themselves.  But Blakes seems
 unwilling to pay me themselves and unable to get Enron to pay me
 directly.  I would appreciate any assistance you can provide on this
 matter.
 
 Thanks, and do have a Merry Christmas.
 
 Larry
 
 
 
 assured him that my invoice which I agreed to do when he said he would
 pay a retainer in advance.
