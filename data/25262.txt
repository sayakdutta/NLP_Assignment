 FYI - did a baseload deal with Union Carbide at Seadrift HPL meter # 1332 for 
 Oct00 that will require some coordination with Terry Calvert of Union 
 Carbide, who can be reached at 713-973-5665.  I want to pass on details in 
 case I'm out when he calls - I'm going to pass on y'all's phone #'s to Terry
 
 Here's the deal:
 


 
 PLUS
 

 
 So Terry knows he's supposed to call us by 9.30am if he wants gas to take any 
 of the last tier.
 
 All the above is in Sitara 415267
 
 Thanks
