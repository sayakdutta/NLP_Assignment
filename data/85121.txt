 
 Richard,  The attached resume is from an attorney who is a friend of an 
 Associate here at Enron.  I had worked with the Associate before but don't 
 know his friend.  I told the Associate that I wasn't sure of our hiring 
 needs, but that I would pass the resume along.  Barbara indicated you were 
 our recruiting coordinator.  So here it is.
