 As far as I'm concerned you have answered my legal questions.  I will add 
 that I think that it is the City which  has preserved its option as to who 
 repairs the road since they have approval authority.  However, this doesn't 
 seem like a big issue to me.
 
 So long as the commercial team is happy with the minor changes with the risk 
 profile, I'm happy.
