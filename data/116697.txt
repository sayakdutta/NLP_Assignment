 El Paso. Real Time isn't used to marking confirms on their deals, since 
 they're usually just trading hour-ahead. Let me know how you'd like these to 
 be changed (i.e. "yes-agreement" or "yes-counterparty to send confirm"), and 
 I'll do that right away.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate

 This deal looks to me like it needs to be confirmed, but it was marked no 
 confirm.  Do you know of a reason why it shouldn't be confirmed?  If not, I 
 need a contact name so that i can send out a letter on it.
 Thanks!
