 
 Mike McConnell asked me to send you a message saying that the sidebar looks 
 fine.
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

 Hi -- I'm the writer in Corporate Public Relations who writes the annual 
 report.
 
 I've written a short sidebar on Enron Global LNG. It's intended to give a 
 bullet-point overview.
 
 Please read it and forward any comments to me. I can be reached at ext. 
 3-6305. If you prefer, you can fax changes to me at 914-736-5987.
 
 I've sent it to Rick and Wayne, whom I interviewed about it.
 
 Thanks,
 Jeannie
