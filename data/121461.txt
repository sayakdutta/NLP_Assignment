 
 Did either one of you guys work on the APEA (American Public Energy Agency) gas prepay deal?  I think it was done in 1999 and Laird Dyer worked on it.  We are changing one of the counterparties and delivery points so we are going to need to amend some of the documents.  I know you two are going to fight over this so as soon as the dust settles, let me know who wins!
 
 Thanks,

 Call me if you have questions or don't know what deal I am talking about.  I have copies of some of the documents so they may be helpful.
