 
 I'm having Chris Foster check on these deals. Stewart is overseas for the 
 holidays and won't be back for awhile, so in the meantime Chris and I will do 
 our best to find out which deals he was referring to. Let me know if anything 
 resembling these deals comes up on your end.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
   
  
 Stewart called last Friday and said there would be some deals for the City of 
 Roseville to be confirmed.  He did not have deal numbers for these deals, and 
 so far, I have not seen any deals for this counterparty.  Do you know 
 anything about these deals?  Can check around and see if anyone else knows 
 about them?
 
 Thanks!
