 Attached is the latest version of the Segmentation Brief.  You should note that it contains three new sections-III A (drafted by Mark Cook) and III C & D (drafted by Ken Driver).  I received some comments on the prior versions of these new sections, but did not incorporate them.  If your comments/concerns are not addressed in the new sections, let me know.
 
 We hope to circulate tomorrow the title page and signature block.  The next version of the brief which will be circulated on Friday, March 30th, will contain table of contents, table of authorities and will be completely cite checked.  In the meantime, you will notice that there are several incomplete cites or record references.  We could use help completing these, if you have the information.
