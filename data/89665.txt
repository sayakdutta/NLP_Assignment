 
 We will not be trading on Thanksgiving.   However, we will have a skeleton crew in here on Friday.   I proposed calcing P&L on Wednesday and not on Friday.

 What are the plans for Thanksgiving and the Friday after?  As of now, it is a P&L holiday; therefore, the risks group will not be here, but EOL wants to know how much support staff they should have.
 
 Thanks,
 Stacey

 Hello Everyone!
 
 Please let us know if your traders are planning on trading on EOL Thursday the 22nd, and Friday the 23rd.  Thanksgiving, of course, is an Enron holiday and Exchange holiday, however we know that the traders sometimes still trade on holidays!
 
 Let us know the level of trading so we can prepare for coverage on our end.
 
 Thanks,
 TARA
