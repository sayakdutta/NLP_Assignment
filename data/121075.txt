 
 Stephanie and I talked about this as well - I think lunch today would be a good send off and a wedding gift on his return would be in order.  
 
  
     
 Guys, has there been any arrangements made for a send off for Phil.... 
 
 We need to get him a card and a wedding gift ( I assume you would agree).
 
 I would also be more than happy to take the group out for lunch 11:30 - 1:00  if people are interested. 
 
 Pls advise.
