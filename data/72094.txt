 Chris,
 You have probably done this already but please insure that 
 accounting/transaction support (Herman Manis or Cris Sherman) have reviewed 
 the proposed sale structure to insure the appropriate accounting treatment 
 for this transaction.
 
 Also, I will need to review and approve all the agreements with NorthWestern 
 before they are finally agreed to between the parties and executed.  As for 
 the purchase of the assets out of the financing facility, Kay knows the 
 required documents from the Intergen deal.  There needs to be close 
 coordination amongst all the internal groups to insure your deal closes 
 timely and accurately.  Remember in your negotiations that the money from 
 NorthWestern needs to be received into escrow a minimum of 5 Business Days 
 before the closing date.  The financing requires the purchase notice (which 
 is irrevocable so if Enron provides it and NorthWestern walks, the turbines 
 are on Enron's balance sheet at 15% interest rate essentially) be provided to 
 the banks at least 5 but not more than 15 Business Days prior to closing date 
 for purchase from the financing vehicle.
 
 Thanks for the heads up.
 
  
    Cc: Mann, Kay; Jacoby, Ben
  
 Lisa,
 
 Sorry, I should have included you in the initial distribution.
 
 Ben Jacoby and I are in negotiations with NorthWestern Corporation in a deal 
 to place the two GE 7EA's (Blue Dog) turbines.  NorthWestern has indicated a 
 strong interest in adding the dual fuel option to the February 2002 delivered 
 turbine.  We hope to have NorthWestern sign the LOI by next Friday, 16 
 (3/16/01) and pay the "Development Fee".  This transaction should be similar 
 to the Intergen deal, with the exception that instead of moving two turbines 
 out of the 24 LM 6000 master contract, we plan on assigning the entire Blue 
 Dog contract to a LLC that Enron will own 100% at the time of transfer and 
 then sell 80% to NorthWestern.
 
 I want to have the change order ready for execution once we come to terms 
 with NorthWestern.  In the event that the deal blows up, we will probably 
 execute the change anyway.  Please let me know if you have any questions or 
 concerns.
 
 Chris

 Chris,  Global Finance (Lisa Bills) needs to be kept in the loop on this, 
 since this is in TurboPark.

 Renee and Brian,
 
 Please prepare a change order to add dual fuel to the February '02 delivery 
 turbine.  The price and commercial information is below.  I have gotten Jeff 
 Darst to extend the deadline to exercise the change order to 16 March 2001.
 
 Please make sure we get the change order prepared before the deadline expires.
 
 Chris
