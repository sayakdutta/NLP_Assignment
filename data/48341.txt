 
 Per Lotus Notes it appears that the above counterparty was acquired by Duke.  
 I have sitting in my files the originals of both theirs and our guarantees.  
 Do we want to keep these in place, mutually cancel them or what?  We sent 
 execution documents to the counterparty and never heard back and put it on 
 the inactive status.
