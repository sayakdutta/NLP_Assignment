 According to Gary Hanks, we would like to have the gas on the valley line 
 anyway

 I can not believe you are sending emails form Hawaii!!!!  You are crazy.  I 
 took care of Camden for the month-
 It is now 330 and Hilcorp has not responded.  I spoke with Jerry Bubert 
 several times today- emailed Mike LAnnou and left messages, and had him 
 paged, and copied Hildebrand (the president).  If we don't hear by 4pm, we 
 are supposed to bypass the gas...........
