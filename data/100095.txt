 
 This is what Ken sent for gas consumption during the pressure loss.
 
  

  
 Below is Griffith plant gas consumption data for yesterday 9/3/01.
 You can see that from the time of loss of gas pressure, HE 8:00, we did not
 recover until HE 14:00.
 This of course extended our test schedule which required even more gas for
 the day.
 
 Note: Duct Burner #2 instrumentation is defective, otherwise the data is
 OK.
