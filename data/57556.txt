 I've got Ken Lay tentatively scheduled to speak to Town Hall Los Angeles on 
 Tuesday, Aug. 7.  They were thrilled to hear that Ken had an interest in 
 speaking to the group, and Jim McNulty with Parsons immediately recognized 
 Ken and wants him to speak about the "big energy picture," given Enron's 
 global perspective.  They've got a pretty heavy energy calendar in the next 
 few months:
  May 16 - Phil Angelides
  June 19 - John Bryson
  July 11 - Steve Ledbetter
  July 26 - Loretta Lynch
 
 You may want to attend these luncheons just to see what  these four have to 
 say.  I've asked if Warren Olney could do the interview w/ Ken, and Adrian 
 Medawar said she'd call him.
 
 Sandra -- would you check with LABA to see if we could do that meeting the 
 same trip (either before or after Town Hall).
 
 Great job lining this one up -- thank you!
 
 See you in San Fran.
