 should have at least that in cash.  If there is any extra leftover and you 
 need the cash, you might as well take it too but that's up to you.  Enron is 
 up a bunch again today so you should do well selling today.  Love,  Charlie
 
 
 
 
 
 

    
 
 Charlie, I got your pictures - thank you - they were neat and I am
 looking forward to the rest of them.  I am anxious to hear about your
 trip but I know that you are probably still trying to recuperate from
 your trip so call me when you feel rested.  I have class tonight and
 will leave about 3:00 and won't get home until 11:00 so obviously
 tonight won't be good.  When I call to sell my Merck and 5 shares of
 Enron will they send me a check?  I can't remember how it works.  Once
 again I want to thank you for watching out for me and my family with
 these investments - I know it is time consuming but very much
 appreciated.  God Bless You!  Love, Margaret
