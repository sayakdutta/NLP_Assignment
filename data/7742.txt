 
 I have asked my assistant Patti to help me in setting up meetings for next 
 week and I had asked her to arrange  a lunch with you and Brent, plus some 
 time for just the two of us to get together.  
 
 We are continuing the worldwide operations/controls review at the request of 
 the two Rick's (Causey and Buy).  That will include a look at Continental 
 power, UK power, UK gas and global products.  Looks as if sometime in April 
 will be the date for that, however, not next week.  --Sally

 Can you do lunch one day?
 
 Also - Bjorn H gave me a rather cryptic 'heads-up' about 'people on there way 
 to London to audit operations' - should we be ready for a review?
