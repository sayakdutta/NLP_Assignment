 The following CPs are not authorized to trade US power:
 
 CMS Field Services, Inc. 
 Howell Corporation -- restricted by credit
 Massachusetts Electric Company -- they sound like a utility, but they are not 
 a current CP and not on my FERC lists of utilities or marketers.  
 Navajo Tribal Utility Authority -- not a current CP/not on my FERC lists
 
 NOTE:  Can you get me a contact for Mass. Electric or Navajo so that I can 
 discuss with them whether they are authorized to trade power.
 ****************************
 
 City of Burbank is authorized to trade West power products only pursuant to 
 the WSPP Agreement.
 NOTE:  Credit has them set up for P only in the West -- I'm not sure why they 
 are thus restricted.
