 Good to hear from you.  
 
 Your right, my job is completely different.  Funny how things evolve like 
 that.  I love it, though.  Very few hurt/sick/deceased folks.
 
 Paige is finishing her junior year at Southwestern, and Michael is in 
 kindergarten at St Francis.  We are very blessed.
 
 Hope all is well with your family.
 
 Kay
