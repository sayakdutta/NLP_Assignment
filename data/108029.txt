 yes...my mom left this morning, and I have three weeks to recoup before I see 
 her again.  She is the nicest person ever, and I feel so guilty that she 
 annoys me.  I am sure I will have a daughter one day who thinks I am totally 
 annoying too.  what goes around comes around!  
 are you better today?  what are you doing for lunch?  did anything good get 
 delivered???
 
 
    
 How's it going?  Recovering from family OD?

 How about Ali "the impaler" Saler?  Or is that too dramatic?
