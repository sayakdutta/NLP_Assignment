 Calling brokers to find out what prices would have been is an impossible 
 task.  I agree with your assessment.  Unfortunately, caps are not disruptions 
 but have become a normal course of business.
 
 
     
 EPMI is entering into more and more transactions that are settled against a 
 floating, published index price.  Our physical contract does not currently 
 provide for what happens if the published source is not available or is 
 otherwise materially changed. Under ISDA for financial trading,  this is 
 addressed as a Market Disruption Event (MDE).  Under ENA's standard contract 
 for financial trading, there is included as a MDE "the imposition of trading 
 limits on the range within which the price of the commodity may fluctuate".  
 What this may mean is that if a cap is imposed on power prices, then in lieu 
 of using the capped price to determine the floating price, you would be 
 required (under ISDA) to eventually get brokers to determine what the price 
 would have been without the cap.
 
 I want to add language to our physical contracts that addresses material 
 changes/disappearance of the published prices that would mirror the financial 
 trading terms and doubt whether we would want to make the imposition of a cap 
 on power prices a MDE.  If you treat the imposition of a cap (say in CA of 
 prices to $500 or in NEPOOL to $1,000) as a MDE, then we would be required to 
 secure quotes as to what the price would have been without the cap each time 
 that a pricing date trades at the cap level.   This only seems fraught with 
 litigation risk to me.  Alternatively, if caps are not deemed a MDE, then you 
 would always settle against the published prices, even if they are 
 "artificially" determined after the trade was entered into.  While caps are 
 not appealing, I think it would be better to not have the imposition of caps 
 be considered a MDE.  I have spoken with the financial trading group and they 
 will follow our lead on this.  So, depending upon what you both think, we 
 will make sure that financial and physical power are treated the same on this 
 issue.  
 
 Thanks for your thoughts.
