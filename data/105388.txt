 
 Hey, Clem:
 
 Hope you had a great New Year!
 
 I'll try to make this easy so that you can respond "yes" or "no":
 
 (1)  FUNB wants ENE remain liable for payments covering "any other damages, 
 costs and attorney's fees".  Do you agree?
 
 (2)  FUNB only wants to make a demand for payment with no strings attached.  
 I'll try to whittle the demand period down from five days to three.  Do you 
 agree:
 
 (3)  Guaranty to be governed by NY law.  Agreed?
 
 I'm sure you enjoyed this little exercise if I hear back from you.
 
 Thanks.  Sara
