 
 I am attaching a operating lease summary which I have revised to include some 
 basic asset operation stuff.  I've left Lisa a voice mail with a brief 
 explanation of what we are doing, and asking her if she would take a look at 
 this from a financing "fatal flaw" standpoint, with Enron being the lessor.  
 
 I've been summoned to Nowhere North Carolina (Rocky Mount) for the remainder 
 of the day and tomorrow, and will be back on Friday am.
 
 
 
 Anne, I hope this helps keep you moving.
 
 Lisa, many, many thanks.
 
 Kay
