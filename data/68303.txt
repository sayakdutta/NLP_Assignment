 I'm in the new building as well.  We were on of the first groups to move in back Oct.  I'm on 4.
 My group is definitely out the door.  Credit Trading is the name of my group and I think the name speaks for
 itself....  
 
  
     
 good idea coming back.  It is a zoo around here.  Looks like D-Day is today.  We will see.  At least I got to move into the new building and see it for a few days.  Where are you currently sitting?

 I came back the 5th of this month because of what is going on.  I was planning on staying out till Dec. but I figured I better get in here and get my resume updated.  
 The baby is doing great, thanks for asking.
 I was just bugging like always.
