 
 Attached are clean and redline versions of the latest markup.  THIS REDRAFT 
 IS BASED UPON COMMENTS RECEIVED TODAY FROM MARTHA PHILLIPS STUART WITH 
 KIRKLAND & ELLIS.   Ms. Stuart has received but has not reviewed the 
 redraft.  We expect to speak with her tomorrow.  Julia Chin is the "point 
 person" for contacting Ms. Stuart.  Thanks.  Sara
