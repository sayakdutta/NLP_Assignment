 is fine with the credit card.  If you work out it is ok to go shop and put it 
 on the credit card.  Just not too much.  By the way DK's birthday is April 30 
 and the JJ's are May 2.  No one expects presents but it would be nice if you 
 got DK a card.  She is taking your car in today to be fixed.

 Have fun at the game tonight.  My week is going just fine.  Nothing exciting
 to report.  By the way, there is $50 at Mom's that is for you because David
 flew home from here last night, and we had to order the ticket on the credit
 card.  The ticket was $68.75 so he'll give you the last $20 next time he
 sees you.  I hope that is ok.  You had said once that I could always use the
 credit card for things like that as long as I paid you back so I did.  You
 can either get it from Mom or wait till I get home and I'll bring it to you.
 With all the prom excitement I completely forgot to give it to you before we
 left - sorry.  Anyway, this week is pretty boring for me because I have
 nothing due and no exams.  I'm glad to have a light week, but it leaves for
 a lot of boredom and down time.  I may have to find something to do
 like......SHOP!!!!!  No I'm just kidding - I wouldn't do that.  Well, I'll
 talk to you sometime this week and have fun tonight.  I hope the rugrats
 feel better soon for their sake and ya'lls!!!!  I love you!!!!
     Love,
     Caron
