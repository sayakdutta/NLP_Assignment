 Louise,
 
 I have master counterparty lists from credit, legal and eol.  Milnthorp and I are getting input from the various desks - we have "national accounts", large regionals and customers.  They are ranked by volume and include type of contract, entity name, credit limits, etc. There are approx 50 counterparties that we want to hit in the first week of business.   We will have some good detail by jan 7.
 
 Regards,
 
 Chris
