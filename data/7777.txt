 I have just spoken with Barry about arranging a visit for him to Houston.  He 
 mentioned the week of 28 February being good for him.  I hope this will suit 
 you and wonder if it will be possible to arrange any meetings with him on the 
 Tuesday 29 Feb and Wednesday  1 March? I will book for him to arrive on the 
 Monday and leave Houston on the Thursday.
 
 Kind regards
 Clare.
