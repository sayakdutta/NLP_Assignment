 Hey,
 
 It has been brought to my attention that the waivers has not been working
 correctly all the time so I have it set up now so that you can pick up
 playersTuesday through Saturday but it will rank each day individually.  I
 have to approve all adds or drops which I will do every evening.  if more
 than one team gose after a player then it will go to the team with the worst
 record and then with the least amount of points.  If you have any other
 questions let me know.  
 
 Thanks,
 
 Scott
