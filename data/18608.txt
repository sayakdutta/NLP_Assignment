 Bill Bradford and I have a phone call with PG&E at noon tomorrow.   We will 
 advise everyone of what we learn.

 Michael, how can we get with PG&E to determine where the discrepancy lies?

 PG&E filed their Schedule F which displays its nonpriority unsecured claims.  
 Many of the claims were listed as unknown in amount.  The PX credit amounts 
 were listed as disputed.   Two PX credit amounts were specified in the 
 Schedule F:
 
 Enron Energy Marketing      $201,964,905.64
 Enron Energy Services       $ 19,737,979.97
 Total disclosed PX credit   $221,702,885.61
 
 Note that in the claims that were listed as unknown in amount, none were 
 described as PX Credit in nature. 
 
 Two points to be made: 1) this information is now public (but on page 5,066 
 of 17,096 on a CD), along with $53,985,167 in other Enron related claims, and 
 2) our calculation of the PX credit was $392,416,534 at the beginning of May.
