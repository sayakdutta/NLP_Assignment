      We understand that you will be attending the ISDA Annual Meeting next
 week, as will be Mark Sisitsky, Ed Nalbantian, Glenn Arden and Kent
 Killelea of Jones Day.  On behalf of the entire firm, we would like to
 invite you to stop by for a drink at our Washington office at 51 Louisiana
 Avenue, N.W., on Wednesday, April 4 between 6:00-7:30 p.m.
 
      We are located with a few blocks of the Library of Congress, so feel
 free to stop by for a few minutes on your way to the reception there.
 Weather permitting, the party will be held on our roofdeck.  The
 receptionists will be able to direct you.
 
      For those of you staying at the OMNI Shoreham, we will also leave
 invitations for you at the hotel.  If you have any questions, please call
 Kent Killelea at Jones Day's Washington office at (202) 879-3448.
 
      We hope to see you all on April 4!
