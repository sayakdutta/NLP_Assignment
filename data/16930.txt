 I think that we should do the case.  I'm willing to help draft, and willing 
 to take a first crack at putting some bullets together about the direction I 
 think the memo ought to take and distribute that by about 5 PM tomorrow.  
 Though it would be good for other folks to do same and then we could compare 
 notes.  Makes sense?  Thoughts?  Suggestions?
 
 Best,
 Jeff
