 Sally,
 
 Following our Doorstep meeting today, I am following up on your request that 
 I forward to you the list of Portland transactions for which we still require 
 documentation, e.g. invoices, SAP entries, etc.  For the Settlements testing 
 only, we reduced the deal population from 23 to ten randomly-selected 
 transactions, in order to facilitate the Settlement group's ability to 
 complete both its monthly close obligations and our Doorstep request.  The 
 deal selection is indicated in yellow, and the missing items, in green.
 
 
 
 
 Also per your request, attached are the five "non-standard" deals for which 
 we have been unable to obtain any information at all.  Our primary need is 
 just to get a basic understanding of these transactions.
 
 Colorado Springs Utilities  10/1/98-9/30/03 Colorado 50-150 MWs
 BPA     10/1/01-12/31/05 NW Delivered 105 MWs
 Welded Tube    1/1/98-6/30/05 PGE - NW 5.2-12MWs
 British Columbia Power Exchange 1/1/98-1/1/15 COB 85-176 MWs
 Harbor Cogen
 
 
 Thank you for your help, Sally,
 Ken
