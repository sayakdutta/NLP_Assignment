 
 Susan, 
 
 I need to see the contract to figure out what is going on.  Do you know which 
 attorney initialed it?  I can get a copy from him.

 Hi Stacy,
 
 Bridgette Anderson is currently briefing a new Enfolio Master Purchase Sale 
 Firm with Cargill, but it is not an "Enfolio II".  It has provisions for 
 collateral and includes an Enron guaranty and limited power of attorney.
 
 I know if it said "Enfolio II", it would be okay to use it in EOL, and I 
 believe it is good for EOL, but I want to confirm that with you.  Also, 
 what's the difference between the two contracts?  Is it just the collateral 
 provisions and guaranty that make it different?  I'd attach a copy, but it 
 hasn't been scanned yet.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Susan
