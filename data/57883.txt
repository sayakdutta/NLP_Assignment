 I think it would be very cool also and I would be willing to help as long as 
 I don't have to spend any time or money.  The best source for this kind of 
 help would be Steve Kean and Mark Palmer.

 Ken,
 
 I mentionned to Jeff that it would be cool if we could have a 363 (ENE) area 
 code for Houston he thinks its a great idea.
 We need to lobby do you have any desire to help?
 
 I know that in the overall scheme of things this is really not important but 
 I think that this should be followed up.
 
 Let me know what you think
 
 Regards
 
 P.

 Philippe,
 
 Here is an outline of the 363 numbering information we talked about, the 
 process is very complicated and may need us to set down with the senior 
 management to explain how it works and the implications, my suggestion is 
 that Ken Rice would be the best one to take it forward, as he understands the 
 market and has some profile as the head of a bandwidth / telecoms company
 
 Tony Alvarado is the lead for this one, his extension is 37801 let me know 
 how you want to proceed
