 
 Andrea,
 
 I had Mark Greenberg, an attorney that works on EOL matters, review Green 
 Mountain's form of CA and he much prefers ours.  What he suggested is that 
 you send the counteparty back our form and say something to the effect that 
 EnronOnline has a standard form of Confidentiality Agreement we prefer to 
 execute our form.  If the form meets with their approval we're golden.  If 
 they don't like it have them call me (and I'll just refer them to Mark!).
 
 Attached is our preferred form.

 Adriane,
 
 Here's our Confidentiality Agreement for execution before we release our
 financials.  Please let me know if you have any feedback.  Thanks.
