 
 I got the agreement this morning but they misspelled Roseville!!  I am having them change it and will email it to you when I get it.  Do you want me to send you a hard copy or is an email version ok with you?
 
 Let me know -
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kim

 Hi Kim.  Anything working on the gas master agreement?  Just a small
 reminder.
