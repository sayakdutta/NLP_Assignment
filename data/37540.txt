 We have been tracking books that are not officialized on a daily basis.  This 
 list goes to Sally Beck and is reviewed at the end of each week by Rick Buy.  
 Rick has been vocal about taking corrective action if people forget to 
 officialize.   It is imperative that we take extra care to ensure that all 
 books are marked official each night before going home.  A control process 
 should be implemented immediately to absolutely avoid being on the list.  
 
 Please contact me if you have any questions (x-35242).
 
 Thanks,
 Mike
