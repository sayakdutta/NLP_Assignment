 
 I am forwarding to each of you the referenced assignment with respect to 
 physical trading and the online account.  I also called the company and got a 
 copy of the name change document they were referring to in the assignment.

  David  --- I gave this doc to Tana Jones (for Eonline trading).  It also 
 referred to physical deals, so she was going to pass it on to Debra 
 Perkingiere.   Call Tana - she can tell you where it is at.   Thanks!     (it 
 did not effect financial trading).

 Could I have a copy of the assignment which I sent to you via interoffice 
 mail the other day for
 PPL Utilities?? I would be interested in picking this up from you if possible.
 
 Thanks
 David
