 
 What were you doing here Sunday???  There's no reason to have to be here on 
 Sunday in that group. And I definitely agree that food is not payment for 
 overtime! We played our softball tournament yesterday.  I'm so sore today I 
 can barely walk...and it hurts to take a deep breath!  I'm really out of 
 shape.  And yesterday they had me batting in front of a guy that would hit 
 these great hits and runs really, REALLY fast.  So I ran most of the day it 
 felt like.  
 
 Let me know how the MRI comes out.  I do want you to keep me informed with 
 how she's doing, but I'm not going to be one of those people that's always 
 asking and driving you crazy.  
 
 Don't work too hard.  And tell what's her name now (wedding girl) I said hi.

 Hey, the wedding girl is back in the office today.  She says she needs a 
 couple more days off!  After a week of partying how could you need more time 
 off?!
 Some one butchered Carla's hair.  Poor thing.  I think I'd go to another hair 
 dresser.
 Megan's getting an MRI this morning.  
 I need another day off because I worked so much Thursday, Friday and Sunday!  
 And food is not payment!
 See ya.  It's a zoo here.
