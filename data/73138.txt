 Greg and Kay:
 
 I have enclosed clean and blacklined copies of the escrow disbursement
 instruction letter, marked to reflect changes from the draft previously
 circulated for signature.  The only revisions were to change the persons
 named to sign this letter to be individuals who are available and who were
 named as authorized on the respective incumbency certificate previously
 submitted to Citibank, and to delete the bracketed information on the first
 page of the letter addressing the GE letter of credit, as this is expected
 to be available by fax on Wednesday.  Please ensure that the signature page
 of this letter is signed and ready  to transmit to Citibank by fax upon
 closing on Wednesday.
 
 If no one has an objection, I will send a draft of this document to Estelle
 Lawrence at Citibank today in order that she can be preparing to receive the
 signed copy by fax tomorrow.   Thanks.
