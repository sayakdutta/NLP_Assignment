 This one is very similar to the one you just did.  In fact, the data is 
 almost identical.  We download power plant outage data from the California 
 ISO website (manual until you guys get some free time to set up an automated 
 scrape).  Anyway, the data gets into an Access database of mine in a table 
 with key fields:  Date and Res Name.  The other fields include Type (planned 
 or unplanned), Owner, Location, plant capacity, and of course, the quantity 
 of the outage.  So, we need basically the large table as the one you did 
 which lists each plant and the outage for "today" and let's say 1 week in the 
 past.  We cannot go in the future because the data gets posted daily for that 
 day only.  Then the other table will just summarize the total "Planned" and 
 "Unplanned" by region.   A copy of the database is attached.  Let me know 
 when you have a chance to start working on it.  Thanks.  
 
 Mat
