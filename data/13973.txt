 Michelle,
 Have you had a chance to look at this?  Is it okay for us to send to the HR VPs and Generalists for them to forward to their client groups?
 Thanks,

 Tim -- Sorry for the delay.  We've been putting out fires all day.  Here's the revised Q&A.  Please make sure legal reviews before it is used and/or distributed.
 
 Thanks!
