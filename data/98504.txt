 give you the go-ahead. Ladies?

 Richard,
 
 Enron Net Works currently supports the joint venture between Enron and Texaco 
 called Bridgeline in the Three Allen Center Building.  My group supports the 
 Trading telephony and recording equipment for this company.  My question is 
 does this new audio retention policy cover this operating company or not 
 since we do support them?
 
 Regards,

 Effective October 15, 2000, the retention period on tape recordings of trades 
 done by telephone will be reduced from four months to one month.  The tapes 
 regarding significant transactions may be retained for such longer period as 
 approved in writing by both the Head Trader and the General Counsel.  Please 
 propose those significant transactions on which you may wish to retain the 
 tapes, prior to October 15, 2000, since the tapes on conversations older than 
 one month (except with respect to litigation matters) will be destroyed on 
 that date.  If you have any questions, please contact Mark Haedicke or 
 Richard Sanders. 
 
 John Lavorato and Mark Haedicke
