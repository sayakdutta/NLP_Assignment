 I understand that Ed sent the assignment agreement to your attention last
 night. As you know, we simply modified the previous document to reflect the
 new arrangement. This morning I noted a couple of mistakes (Sec. 6&7). This
 draft shows changes from the document we sent last night. Open items include
 an appropriate discount rate on the Mieco payment to Enron and whether we
 will do 125 MW or 100 MW both items being discussed by Peter D'Anna and Ed
 Sacks. We appreciate your cooperation.
