 Does this mean that we are no longer limited on the volume that we previously were limited to on PNM?
 
 I'm very glad that this passed.  Thank you for your help!  Kim.
 
  
     
 Just in case you didn't hear, both NNG and TW received approval to acquire third party capacity.  The orders came in last night approving the tariff sheets as we filed them.  If you would like to see the language that will be in the tariff, send me a note back and I can get it to you.  We specifically didn't limit ourselves to just interstate pipeline capacity in the wording that we used--in TW's tariff, we deleted any reference to limiting the amount of PNM capacity that could be purchased.  Thanks for your help with this.
