 either Kristie Patrick's (in Mark Palmer's office) or my budget.

 Cindy:
 
 I have just received from Jeff Shankman's office under a cover letter dated 
 November 9, 2000 a draft of a Gifting Agreement between The Wharton School 
 and Enron, outlining a gift of $1,000,000 to Wharton for its eBusiness 
 Initiative at the Corporate Partner level. The draft reflects that we would 
 pay $250,000 for each of the next 4 years, commencing in December 2000.  My 
 understanding is that Jeff Shankman and Jeff Skilling have approved of this 
 gift.
 
 Before we finalize this arrangement, are you aware of any 
 issues/matters/provisions that Enron typically attempts to deal with in these 
 types of gifting arrangements? I just want to make sure that we don't 
 overlook anything material. If you would like to see a copy of the draft 
 Agreement, I can have it delivered to you.
 
 Your prompt reply is appreciated.Thanks.
 
 Best Regards, Alan
