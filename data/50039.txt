 
 Darrell,
 
 Grant Masson, Ronnie Chahal and myself made a contribution to the book
 on energy derivatives to be published soon in Australia (a book by
 Clewlow and Strickland).
 
 Given our growing workload and responsibilities, the quality of the paper is 
 less
 than satisfactory. I would like to make sure that there are no obvious and
 embarrassing  errors in what we submit. I would appreciate if you could 
 take a quick look at the chapter and give us the feedback (under the same
 arrangement as in the previous cases).
 
 Thanks for looking at our storage model. I shall give you a call within the
 next few days to update you on our work and developments at Enron.
 Vince will start his senior year in 6 weeks. He wants to graduate and look
 for work: he thinks getting an advanced degree in his field makes
 no economic sense. He spent the summer building his
 own computer (1000 MHz clock speed). I was the unskilled immigrant worker
 toiling under his management.
 
 I hope everything is well at home and that your wife's company is doing great.
 
 Regards.
 
 Vince
