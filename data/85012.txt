  That email was pretty true.  School can be extremely stressful in short 
 periods (around finals) but overall compared to work it was really a pretty 
 easy lifestyle.  How are thing's going for you with school?  Sounded like 
 this month was going to be a busy one.  The good thing about school is that 
 there is a definite ending point with a break between.  
  It has calmed down some around here.  Focusing on things that I had dropped 
 during the end of quarter stretch.  I bought a new guitar yesterday.  My 
 friend Eric and I had our eye on this black Fernandes model for some time and 
 yesterday we decided to go for it.  I am still in the learning stages of 
 playing but it won't be too long before fame and stardom are at my disposal.  
 Well maybe a little longer than that.  Playing is really fun and a good 
 stress reliever though. 
 
 Hope everthing is going well for you. 
 
 Take care,  
 Gerald
