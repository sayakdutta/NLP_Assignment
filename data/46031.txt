 Clarifications...
 Exodus Communications, Inc. (executed by David Berberian)
 SAP - will send information shortly to get that one going.
 FinancialSettlementMatrix.com - I think this is the full company name.  I 
 will have to clarify tomorrow, if necessary.
 inwarehouse.com - I am in posession of executed NDA done through EBS (they 
 may not have filed their copy yet, just finished last week).  I will forward 
 to you if you'd like
 
 Everything else looks great!

 I checked your list against the EBS list and came up with the information 
 below.  Can you verify the full names of the companies below.  Upon receipt, 
 I will request copies of existing NDA's from EBS.
 
 Thanks!

 Tana-
 
 Here are the companies that we are currently talking with that require an 
 NDA.  I believe that all of these are covered under NDA via EBS.
 
 I assume it's common practice to have to go through this process due to our 
 group's move from one company to another, but have been asked by one of our 
 originators if there's a way to work around it;  the point being that it's an 
 inconvenience to the counterparty to jump through another hoop because of our 
 situation.  
 
 Let me know if there's anything I can do to help you!
