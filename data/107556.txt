 Christian:  What do you think about Pat's response?  Sara
 
 
  
     
 I apologize for not getting back to you, Sara.  Things have gone a
 little nuts here, as I am sure they have in Houston.
 
 My basic question about whether I am the right guy for you is:  Do you
 really want to sue this firm if things turn bad?  Wouldn't you rather
 turn on a firm which doesn't have an ongoing relationship with Enron?
 
 In other words, what good is an outside opinion to you really if its
 contradicts the in-house opinion your receive.  What good is it if it
 just confirms the in-house opinion but is wrong.
 
 My suggestion would be to seek an opinion from Glendale's outside
 financing counsel.  That should give you a clear signal whether outside
 counsel with independent skin in the game is willing to back the City's
 opinion.
 
 Sorry I am not being more help on this.  Let me know if there is more to
 talk about.
 
 
     
 
 Pat:  I never received a response from you.  Are you the lawyer
 available to assist me in this matter?  Thanks.  Sara
