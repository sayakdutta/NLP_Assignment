 Debra,
 
 I thought I would touch base with you on the status of the Material Adverse
 Change language for the above agreement.  I did speak with Marie Heard
 yesterday and she indicated she would contact you concerning this language.
 Marie advised that even though this language was approved for the Bandwidth
 agreement, it would not necessarily be approved for this gas agreement.
 
 This particular language needed special approval from our CFO as it differs
 from our "approved" language.  In light of that, I am sending you our
 standard language in case the "bandwidth" version is not acceptable to
 Enron's gas Credit people.
 
 We are very anxious to finalize this agreement, so please let me know if
 there is anything I can do from our side to expedite this.  I really
 appreciate all of your assistance!
