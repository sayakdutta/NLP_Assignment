 
 Three weeks ago I started a 15 minute meeting in my office on Monday mornings 
 for a key group working on the commercialization effort of mid and back 
 office services.  Attendees are my key operations personnel involved, Todd 
 Busby (for a preview of what's to come), Rahil and Fred Philipson.  The 
 purpose of the meeting is to review progress on items agreed to for the 
 previous week and to establish priorities for the current week.  I have been 
 capturing all of this on the white board in my office to date.  Today I 
 decided to recap in writing for everyone.  Thought that you might be 
 interested.  Open the attachment to the e-mail below.  This way you will know 
 more of the details of our efforts each week.  --Sally

 last week are noted and commitments for this week are detailed as well.  Let 
 me know if anything has been left off the list.  --Sally
