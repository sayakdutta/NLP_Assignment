 
 Chris,
 
 Thanks for the invitation. I shall be glad to meet you and your family in 
 Sydney at your home.
 
 I am enclosing the draft of my part of the chapter. It's more than 
 preliminary  but I hope
 to improve it greatly over the weekend. I shall forward you a new version on 
 Sunday evening
 my time. Grant is moving along on his part. I  hope it reduces the penalty to 
 broken knee-caps.
 
 I shall send you a longer message from home to give you an update on my 
 conversations
 with EPRM  regarding the articles.
 
 
 Vince
 
 
 
 
 
 


    
 
 
 Hi Vince,
 ?
 Just a friendly reminder that the hired guns are  making their way up to 
 Houston to visit with you and Grant.
 ?
 I was reading the promotional material for the EPRM  conference here in July. 
 I wanted to invite you to dinner at my apartment on the  evening between the 
 main conference and the post-conference seminars (18th  July). We have a 
 pretty spectacular view of the Harbour here that you might  enjoy.
 ?
 Best regards.
 ?
 Chris.
