 Discussions are progressing on the sale of Portland General.  I currently believe that it is unlikely that we will be in a position to seek approval at the August 14th board meeting, but it is possible.  We are working with all of the relevant groups (RAC, tax, accounting, etc.) just in case things break our way.  (Rick, Randy Petersen is working with us from RAC.)
 
 I will keep you apprised as things develop, especially if thing accelerate in the next few days.
 
 I hope you are doing well,
 Mark
