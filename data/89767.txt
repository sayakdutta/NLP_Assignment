 
 See you Monday.
 
  
     
 Kevin,
 
 I stopped by but I just missed you.  I will be in early Monday morning (to hopefully alleviate your work load).  Let me know if you want me to manage the stack first thing in the morning or if you want to transition it during the day. 
 
 I realize things feel like shit right now (we sued Microsoft for breach of the contract) but we will turn this ship around. 
 
 Hang in there.  
 
 See you Monday.
