 
 Dawn,
 
 I met David Sobotka from Koch this morning and we talked about  coordinating 
 our presentations.
 This means there will be changes intended to avoid overlaps. Sorry for that. 
 The portions of my presentation
 will survive (those about valuation paradigms) and I shall add a few more 
 pages on accounting treatment of weather derivatives
 plus more specific examples. David will cover primarily market evolution + 
 plus examples of some
 standard structures, and we shall both give more interesting examples of
 specific deals executed by our companies.
 
 I shall send you an updated version of my part next week. Let me know what 
 the deadline is.
 
 Vince
 
 
 
 

    
 
 Thanks -- would you like me to include these in the conference book? or do
 you anticipate changes?
 
 Dawn
