 Hi Richard and Julie,
  We are looking forward to seeing you when you come to Ft. Worth. You should
 be getting close to finishing your class! I bet you can't wait! When do you
 plan on coming up? Is the whole family coming? Maybe we could get Rob and Amy
 and Camille over for dinner? If you have other plans that is fine to. See you
 soon.
  Susan
