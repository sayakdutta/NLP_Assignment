 looks good.  i'm working some stuff now that is writing to the z:\ drive for publishing on the web -- i will have it write to i: and set it up so it will be easy to change from now going forward.  should be able to tell if it works from that.  i think your idea was a good one.  
 
 
     
 
 Cooper,
  
 Have a look.
  
 How should we test this?
  
  
 Thanks
