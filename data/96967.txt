 I assume that you may have already handled this, but just in case I thought I would remind you that the expiration date under the existing standstill agreement is June 20th.  My general sense is that I thought we probably would want to extend it, at least once to see if any type of deal is possible.  Is that the current thinking?
 
 I assume that your groundstrokes are pretty powerful now since you have been practicing for a few days with very haeavy and soggy tennis balls.  In all seriousness, I hope that you made it through the weekend ok.
 
 Let me know if you want to follow up.  I am looking for a "doctor's note" to escape from Sithe.
