 
 By unanimous vote we will pre-determine the draft order.  So, if nobidy has 
 any objections, I will pick the draft order here at work under the scrutinhy 
 of several other players ( Dave B, O. Winfree, M. Lenhart, M. Walters).
 
 Also, by majority vote, will have a required tight end posn.  Meaning the 
 starting lineups will include 1QB, 2 RBs, 3 WRs, 1 TE, 1 K, 1 Def.
 
 
 Please e-mail back if you are ok with me picking the draft order.
