 Tom sent me an email yesterday.  I would encourage you to seriously consider the opportunity.  At this point, I am not sure what my exact needs are in the East, but as we all know things tend to change rather quickly around here.
 
 Let me know if I can help you with your decision.

 Just so you don't forget me.  I know its early but I'm interested in coming back.  I'm sure you don't know what you will need until after we find out what happened today.  Tom Martin was asking me if I would be interested in going to the Texas Desk to take Daren Farmer's place, Daren is going to AEP.  I told him I would like to talk to you about the East Desk first.  Tom would like an answer by Monday.
 
 Let me know.
 
 Thanks
