 I will make these changes this morning. Do you want me to circulate the
 revised draft once these changes are incorporated, or are we expecting
 more comments?

 Kent/Kay-
 
 I've redline the Salmon contract for Exhibits A and B, Purchase Amount,
 Maximum Liability Amount, and Unit Liability Amount.  The Power System
 Stabilizer has been struck from scope, because I can recall Bill
 Williams
 advising that LV would need them, Delta/Salmon would not.  That's
 consitent
 with the other units going to CA (w/ Intergen).
