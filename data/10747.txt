 Lynn--
   Today during the team leader meeting you mentioned setting up a meeting with the Solution Center for next Tuesday. I realized
 later that I was planning to comp next Tuesday because I am working this coming weekend. Possibly they might be short-staffed
 next week with it being Thanksgiving week. Could we schedule with them for the Tuesday after Thanksgiving?
 
                                           Thanks-
                                                  Shirley
