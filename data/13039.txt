 Thanks for all of your help on this -- I appreciated your efforts and 
 explanations.  Perhaps we will work together again in the future.

 Michelle,
 ?
 Further to my voicemail, should we advise the actuaries to  cease their due 
 diligence work on the Celgar pension plans? They have just  called me to 
 advise about some further liabilities under the supplementary plan  for 
 non-union employees. Thanks.
