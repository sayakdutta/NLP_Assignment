 Dan,
 
 Sorry it's taken me so long to get back to you on this -- I got
 sent out to the field for most of the day.
 
 Can you send me your fax number so I can get you the
 legal description.
 
 Also, I don't think a duration time is necessary.  It would
 be in HPL's best interest to have this easement in
 perpetuity.  HPL will have the right to abandon the line
 in place if it so chooses.
 
 Thank you for your excellent and fast help!!!

 Robert,
  Where is the description of our right-of-way which we want to put in this 
 document before we send it out.  I think we need to change the first 
 paragraph, but I need to see the description to verify.  Is it intended that 
 we are dealing with only one owner, or is this developer using a different 
 ownership for each development.  Maybe it is all one development?  Otherwise 
 the form looks okay.  Should we consider adding language regarding duration 
 of easement grant, i.e. abandonment after 5 years of non-use.

 Dan,
 
 I have previously discussed this proposed easement with Barbara
 and Ann Elizabeth.  In a nutshell, a large developer wishes us to
 define a series of mainly undefined easements in Fort Bend 
 and Brazoria Counties.  My response to them was to release the
 earlier easements and in their place sign a single new easement with
 language most favorable to HPL.
 
 Attached is a draft of my proposed easement.  Please review
 and make any changes you deem necessary or desirable.
 
 Thanks!!!
