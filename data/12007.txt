 
 Roger, thats great that the public notice for station 3 and 4 air permits 
 will initiate on October 4.  I really appreciate your work and effort on 
 this. I will be looking forward to reviewing the rough draft for both of the 
 permits during the first week of October.....
 
 
 
 

   
  
 
 
 Larry,
 
 An advertisement in the Navajo Times on October 4 will start the 30-day
 public comment period for the Leupp and Klagetoh permit mods.  We will send
 you copies of the draft permits and statements of basis, which you should
 receive a day or two before October 4.
 
 I will be out of the office until October 22.  If you have any questions
 about these permits in my absence, please call Gerardo Rios at
 415.744.1259.
