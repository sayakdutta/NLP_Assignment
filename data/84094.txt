 
 Renee, Did Sofregaz ask for these changes?  If so did they recommend this 
 specific language?
 
 
 
 
     
 
 
 
 Please find attached the latest draft of the proposed Capital Construction 
 Term Rate Agreement with Sofregaz US.  I have not yet sent these changes back 
 to Sofregaz yet.  Our (EECC) legal department approves these changes, but I 
 wanted to make sure Gerald and Enron Storage Co. approved these changes.  The 
 only changes made were to Section 19, General Indemnity.  This is a 
 comparison copy showing the changes from our standard Capital Construction 
 Agreement.
 
 Gerald, the contract is with EECC, but Enron Storage Co. could use an 
 Affiliate Work Offer.  I just realized that there is no Exhibit showing the 
 Work Offer form, so I will correct that and make the work offers Exhibit F. I 
 will attach a copy of our affiliate work offer for your review.
 
 Please get back to me with any comments.  I will then reply back to Sofregaz.
 
 Thanks.
 Renee
