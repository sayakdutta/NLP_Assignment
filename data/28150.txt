 Here is the latest draft of the filing for transport options.  Significant 
 changes include:
 
 - added definition of Counterparty
 - added captions and reorganized the filing to more clearly reflect 
 compliance with 154.202
 - included an explanation of how the option fee will be part of a negotiated 
 rate
 - added an example of how options will work
 
 I think we need to decide whether we are better off with the type of option 
 fee explanation I have in this draft, or whether we should instead state the 
 fee will be market based, and include an explanation that, pursuant to the 
 Commission's discussion in Order 637, market based rates are appropriate 
 because we are going to commit to an open season process that will be 
 nondiscriminatory and that will ensure we aren't withholding capacity from 
 the market.  
 
 Can we have a conference call to discuss your comments this week?  I will 
 have Janet call to determine your availability.
