 I received an invoice from Cook Inlet for July for three deals on EPNG that we do not have in the system.  My contact faxed me their confirmations and I have located two of the deals in Path Manager, but I cannot find the third.  The two that I can find are EOL deals on 7/31 that have not been pathed.  They are deal numbers 952730 and 952205.  The third deal was for 5,000/day from 7/28 - 7/30 at $4.70.  They show a trade date of 7/27.  I don't see this deal in the system at all.  My contact says that all of these deals were offset deals that should have been sold back to Cook Inlet.  He thinks that we billed him for part of the gas, but we have not paid for any of it.  Did we buy this gas from Cook Inlet?  Should it all be sold back to Cook Inlet?  I would appreciate any help you can give me.
 
 Thanks,
 Megan
