 Carol,
 
 We are fine with proposed amendment, item (2) in the June 14, 2000 letter.
 I don't understand the purpose for the increase to $10 million proposed in
 item (1).  Is this based on current business or some internal credit policy?
 My records show, with the exception of June, ESI is in a net sell position
 pretty much through the term of the Guaranty.
 
 Please advise and provide your detail if you show otherwise.
