 Linda:  Mary Hain and Tim Beldon have been working with Oregon PUC 
 Commissioner Ronnie Euchas on electricity information disclosure.    From 
 yesterday's hearing, there was some consensus to include legislative language 
 in the energy bill to address transparancy issues.  As you know, Senator 
 Wyden and Steve Kean had a positive exchange on this issue during the hearing 
 due to the questions we had drafted.  I can work on the bipartisanship issue 
 and gain support for federal bill inclusion from Murkowski, but we need a 
 state federal nexis on drafting the legislative language to assure it meets 
 both the federal and state needs.  please advise.  many thanks.

 Cynthia,
 
 Thanks for getting me the Q&As for the hearing.  Senator Wyden is interested 
 in
 following up on the issue of electricity information disclosure and would like
 to work with Enron on this.  I would appreciate any input you could provide on
 how best to go about this through legislation, what sort of information should
 be disclosed, to whom and when, whether financial information as well as
 operating information should be included, and any suggestions for a Republican
 on the Committee who you think would be good for Senator Wyden to work with on
 legislation.
 
 Thanks again for your help and I look forward to working with you further on
 this.
 
 - Joshua
