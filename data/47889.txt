 Miss Tana ---
 Is this app almost through Legal?  The customer is anxious to get on board 
 --- this has been an extremely difficult process so far.
 Thanks, Tana, and have a wonderful holiday weekend.

 Ladies,
 
 What's the status on this registration?  The customer is eager to receive 
 transaction status (calls fairly often so I would call that "eager").
 
 Thanks,
 Griff
