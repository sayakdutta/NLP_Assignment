 Jeff,
 
 Occidental and I have developed significant philosophical differences on how
 to run our gas and liquids business.  I am committed to making a career
 change shortly after the first of the year.  I know that you are busy, but I
 would appreciate you taking a brief look at my resume and giving me a heads
 up on the best way to approach Enron.  Thanks.
