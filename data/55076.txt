 should not count. M. Chahal was transferred to the New Company, the rest are 
 summer interns
 (gone back to school), or part-time high  school or college kids. I shall 
 walk  around and remind the rest
 of the crowd about the deadline.

 Vince --
 
 We have been working the last few days to get ENA's United Way participation 
 rate up as high as possible.  I called earlier about your Cost Center because 
 the following 16 employees were listed in Power Trading, but I believe are 
 part of the Research organization.
 
 If you have a chance, could you encourage them to log onto 
 http://unitedway.enron.com on the intranet and make a contribution to the 
 United Way.  The deadline is today.
 
 Thanks.
 
 Eric
