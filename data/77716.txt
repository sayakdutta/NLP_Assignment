 Are you just finding out?  I know there are things that can be done to help 
 that situation.  Do you want me to block you out for Friday afternoon as 
 well.  You need to get this taken care of quickly for Michael's sake.

 Michael problems. He has ADD and some other lesser learning problems.  We are 
 going to meet  with the specialist next week.
 
 I'm going to try to take off Friday afternoon as well.  We are thinking of

 personal stuff to take care of.
