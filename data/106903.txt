 
 It's OK this time.  The Determination Period in this confirm is confusing; 
 exchange-based price sources should be tied to the delivery 
 month/Determination Period.

 Sara, 
 
 Sharon at Cargill called in regards to deal EW5791.1.  She wants to see if we 
 can delete the Effective Date and Termination Date on the confirmation.
 
 (Since the term is defined in the Determination Period, she thought it would 
 be less confusing.)
 
 Let me know what you think....
