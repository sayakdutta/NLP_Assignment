 
 End of July should be fine.  I am planning to be out July 26, 27 and 28, 
 taking our 16 year-old on a tour of some college campuses before she starts 
 her junior year.  Motivational, I hope!  --Sally

 Thanks for your note.  I have another profile interview to do with Mark 
 Frevert on July 12.  At that time, we will schedule a photographer for both 
 of you for the end of July.  Will this work for you?  If not, just let me 
 know!
