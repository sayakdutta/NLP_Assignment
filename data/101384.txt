 
 I actually do know that girl...helped recruit her a year or so ago.  She always seemed nice to me and normal, but I'll ask around and see what I turn up.  Yes, I am still coming over there.  I get into London on the 6th of June and fly out on the 12th.  Please let me know if you're going to be in town during that time.  I really want to try and get together while I'm there.  I may be going elsewhere the 6th thru the 9th (my friend, Emily, wants to take a little trip somewhere) but I will definitely be in town Saturday night through Monday...let me know.
 
 I was very excited to hear about Caycie too.

 Hi Ashley,
 
 A friend of mine forwarded this email over to me indicating that your were
 in
 search of a roommate.  I work for Enron and will be relocating to London
 this
 July.   I'm not sure if you are still looking for a roommate, but if you
 are
 still interested I'd like to talk to you.  Enron is located in Central
 London,
 as you may already know, so the mentioned apartment would be an ideal
 location.
 Please email me back if you are still looking and perhaps we can further
 discuss.
 
 Thanks for your time,
 Millie Gautam

 I don't know how this fits in with your August 17 deadline, but this is
 what my
 sister is aware of.

 The 380 is the total price so that would be divided.  You are about a 5
 mintue walk from Westminister.

 I am looking for a female to share a 2 bedroom flat in Central London.  The
 rent is
 
 
 
 ?380 per week total.  It is an extremely nice 2nd story gated flat
 which gets great sun and is located just to the side of the National
 Gallery.
 
 You have your choice of Leicester Square, Charing Cross, Embankment, or
 Piccadilly Tube stops.  Each is within 1/4 mile of the flat.  It is a 15
 minute bus ride to the City which includes time spent waiting for the bus!
 
 I am looking for someone to move in August or September and stay at least
 through the end of June.
 
 If you have any questions please call Ashley at 0788-418-5453 (mobile).
 Please forward this to anyone you feel might be interested.
 
 Thank you,
 Ashley Marynick
