 Hi John. It was really good to hear from you. As  well I think you have a good idea of what I think of your corporate success. Not  to take away, in any way, what I think of you and the family on a personal  basis. give them all my love.
  
 John, I did send you the article on David Cassie's  compensation at CIBC World Markets.
  
 Could you e-mail me your new title [to update my files] and  business address.
  
 Thanks
  
 Uncle Frank.
