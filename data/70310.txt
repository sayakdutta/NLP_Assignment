 Stuart is working on a transaction to sell the asset (Gleason), and therefore 
 this ageement needs to be documented asap, which means in the next few days.  
 Please review the attached and give me a call.

 I've reached a verbal agreement with Westinghouse on the LD issues.  I've 
 attached a letter outlining the agreement.  Could you review from a legal 
 standpoint?  Call me with questions.
 
 Thanks,
