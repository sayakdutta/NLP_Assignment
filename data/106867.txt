 
 Patricia:  I was wondering if you had an opportunity to speak with any 
 persons associated with the Argentine Derivatives Association in connection 
 with our discussion of last week.  I can't recall if you were going to try to 
 speak with the lawyers for Citibank and/or Morgan to determine whether the 
 ADA might welcome our participation in the association, and specifically, 
 with respect to the template currently in circulation.  I think you were also 
 going to attempt to locate a current membership list for the association.  
 Please advise when you have further information.
 
 I am trying to plan several trips to Argentina and Brazil.  I am considering 
 a trip to BA during the week of February 28.  Will you be in town that week?  
 During my visit, my tax colleague from Houston and I will try to meet with 
 local tax consultants and organizations lobbying for tax reformation.  
 Regards.  Sara
