 waiting on some Exhibits.

 Kevin from MidCon Texas called and was inquiring as to the status of the 
 Interconnect agreement.  He said that they had signed it and sent it over for 
 HPL's signature.  I have not seen it or heard of anything for several 
 months.  Do you know the status?  Would you please let me know either way.
 
  Thanks,  Jim
