 
 You bet I will be there for the No Le Hace.  Got the Austin women lined up 
 for me? Nothing significant in the love life area.  Just hoeing around 
 Houston as much as possible.  If you get a chance can by and see me in 
 Houston.  Let me know more details on the No Le Hace when you get a chance.

 G man,
 
 No Le Hace Dos is set for the Friday before Labor Day. Can you make it?
 
 I have been doing well. The wedding plans have been a pain but it will all
 be over soon. How's your love life? I need to come to Houston to see for
 myself.
 
 Hope your doing well.
