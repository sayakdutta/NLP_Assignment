 Yes,
 
 It had by shipper, by contract level info.  -- the type of info available on 
 our transactional reports.  There is a protective order in place in the 
 proceeding, so I don't believe the information is generally available.  We 
 did not ask for confidential treatment -- but we did excise rate information 
 for periods prior to Sept. 2000 (the date that this info started appearing on 
 our transactional reports).

 Shelley, how detailed was the information provided?  Was it broken down by 
 shipper?  Also, did you request confidential treatment?

 FYI 
 
 Judge Wagner issued a subpoena to Transwestern and several other pipelines in 
 the referenced proceeding at SoCal Edison's request.  The request sought 
 information on scheduled, actual and contracts quantities to the California 
 border for the time period 1997 to present.  While we are not a party in the 
 case, we decided to cooperate in the proceeding and not file a motion to 
 quash.  We responded yesterday.
