 Can you take care of faxing him a copy of the ISDA and guarantees ASAP.  
 Thanks!

 I am looking for the ISDA Schedule, Paragraph 11 to the Credit Support Annex 
 and the Enron and Kellog guarantees.  If at all possible, it would be ideal 
 if you could e-mail me the execution versions of these docs.  Alternatively, 
 please fax them (my fax no. is +44 20 7783 4539).
 
 Many thanks for your help.
 
 Regards
 
 Deepak
 
 
    
  
 The Kellogg ISDA Agreement has been signed, but it is somewhat long.  Would 
 you like me to fax it to you (if so, what is your fax no.?) or would you like 
 me to fedex it to you?
