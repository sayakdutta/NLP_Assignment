 3:30pm tomorrow the 9th will be fine.  We will have to change the schedule 
 a little bit, but I believe it will work.
 
 Kevin Kindall   3:30 PM
 Grant Masson   4:00 PM
 Tanya Tamarchenko  4:30 PM
 Vince Kaminski  5:00 PM
 
 Same scenario - upon arrival in the lobby go to the security desk and ask
 for me.  I will meet you in the lobby of the 19th floor.
 
 Thanks so much for your flexibility!

 Sure, tomorrow is fine with me.  Is it possible to schedule it at 3:30 PM?
 
 And I am sure it is not an easy task to fit the schedule of several people to
 be available at the same time window.  So please feel free to let me know if
 you will need to do another time adjustment.
 
 
     
 
 Valeria:
 
 Please do not think we are always this unorganized, but things just seem
 to be happening right now and it is disrupting everyone's schedule.
 
 Would you possibly be able to come tomorrow the 8th?  Kevin Kindall
 will not be here on the 15th and he would definately like to interview you.
 Then Vince Kaminski will be gone for two weeks after the 15th.  It seems
 like tomorrow might be the best time for everyone, if it is for you.
 
 We can begin the interviews at 3:00 PM and probably end them at 5:00
 or 5:30 pm.
 
 Please let me know.
 
 Thanks so much for your understanding.

 Definitely - any of these days sound good to me.  The only concern that I
 have, is that I have my graduate class on Thursday night at 6 PM which is
 September the 14th.
 So if you will schedule the interview on the 14th of September, I would
 need
 to leave around 5:15 PM so I could attend  my  class.
 
 It actually might be more convenient for me to meet with the interviewers
 on
 the 15th of September.  If this day does not fit the schedule of any of the
 interested in interviewing individuals, I surely will be able to meet with
 them on the 14th.
 
 I will be looking forward to your reply.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Valeria Stone
 
 
     
 
 Valeria:
 
 Would you be able to do the interview on the 14th or 15th instead of the
 13th?  Vince Kaminski, who would really like to interview you, has been
 called out of town on the 13th.  He will be back on the 14th.
 
 Also Grant Masson is conducting an Options Seminar on the 13th and
 would not be able to interview you until after 5:00 PM.
 
 Please let me know if we can just push the interview to the same time
 frame only on the 14th or 15th.
 
 Thanks!
