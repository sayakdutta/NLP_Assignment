 
 Paolo,
 
 I cannot open the file. When I try to use my Acrobat reader, I get
 a message that the file does not begin with %PDF-. The file that
 I receive is winmail.dat; the pdf files typically have an extension 
 .pdf  and begin with teh same string of characters.
 Possibly, the file is modified by the E-mail program.
 
 
 My fax number is 713 646  2503.

 Vincent,
 
 Try with this file. It is a pdf one. If it does not work again let me know,
 so that I can fax you the document. In this case I would need your fax
 number.
 
 Thank you again for your time and understanding.
 
 Best regards,
 
 Paolo Cadoni
