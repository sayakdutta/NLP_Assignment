 
 In the three years I have been here, I am unaware of an ENA/ECT bad faith 
 claim against any insurance company. Anyone else? If so, please contact 
 Michelle.

 Justin, I have no knowledge of any bad faith actins Enron has pending inTexas 
 but I will call Richard Sanders who manages domestic litgation here.  I've 
 read the materials you sent and agree we need to address these allegations 
 appropriately.  
 
 Richard do you have any bad faith litigation pending against any insurers in 
 Texas or are you aware of any Enron has filed??  We sued Houston Casualty 
 last year but I don't recall making any bad faith claims.  It settled anyway, 
 a long time ago.

 Michelle,
 Did you get my fax on Friday? I guess the questions on which I should like
 your steer are: (a) Do you have a particular sensitivity about the reference
 to bad faith proceedings made by United India? (b) Is it right that Enron
 has 3 sets of bad faith proceedings in Texas? (c) Are you happy with the
 draft letter to Beachcrofts I sent you?
 
 Please give me a call if you would like to discuss.

 Not when I was there, but I wasn't there the whole time.

 Michelle and Ken,
 
 were you able to discuss the "bad faith" proceedings issue yesterday? If
 you
 got the chance today, I should be really grateful if one of you could give
 me a call to discuss this issue; I think we should set out DPC's position
 clearly on this in correspondence without too much delay.
 
 Justin
