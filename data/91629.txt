 Bob (and all),
 
 let's postpone until tomorrow (or next week if you're not available) - no need to force the meeting.
 
 can you do it tomorrow at the normal time?

 Calgary Gang -
 
 I have a doctor's appointment this afternoon, and will be leaving a little early. Can we do this at 12:00 Portland time?
