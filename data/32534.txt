 In reconciling with CES I have come across deal numbers 144284, 229286, and 
 232373 that have CES as the counterparty but in the terms they show the deal 
 is actually with Allied.  CES has paid everything we invoiced them, including 
 these three deals, but they have admitted that they are unfamiliar to them.  
 I have not said anything to CES yet.  Do we need to change the counterparty 
 or what action should we take?
 
 Thank You,
 
 Molly
