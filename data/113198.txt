  with the program and by pushing ARTO to use a better CM model, we'll get l=
 everage.  Taking it to the PUCO is a nice step, but I don't think that they=
  are going to change the current ARTO program. =20
 
 By the way, where is the PUCO on ARTO / MISO issues?
 
 Thanks,=20

 That would be great.  One thought would be to file it in the docket where w=
 e filed on the native load issue, a copy of Ron's testimony. =20

 Good idea!  Janine--we will get you Ron McNamara's testimony on behalf AEP =
 (SWEPCO in Texas) and see if it will help in Ohio.
 
  
     
 Why can't we use AEP's position against them in their own backyard (Ohio). =
   AEP's position is that you can't have effective retail markets without re=
 al-time energy markets (which I agree with), yet there is no real-time ener=
 gy market with ancillary clearing prices in AEP's service territory in Ohio=
 .
 
 Can we use their own testimony against them?
 
  
     
 AEP asked the Texas PUC to postpone opening the Texas (outside of ERCOT) re=
 tail market because there is no centralized dispatch (per Ron M's testimony=
  on behalf on AEP).  After talking with our SPP folks (I understand that EP=
 MI has bid to serve a portion of Entergy's load) , Jim's testimony is that =
 the outside of ERCOT Texas market should open 1/1/02 and that other states =
 have implemented retail open access without a centralized dispatch model (f=
 or example, AEP in Ohio, ComEd in Ilinois and Duquense in ECAR/PA).  Jim st=
 ates that while RTOs and central dispatch will certainly facilitate the mar=
 ket, it is not absolutely required, and that, if AEP thinks that the retail=
  market will not be competitive without it, then, perhaps, REPS other than =
 AEP should be the only ones allowed to serve retail load in this part of Te=
 xas until central dispatch is in place.  In addition, he states that the im=
 balance provisions should be changed and that network firm capacity should =
 be available to REPs (without the need for protracted system impact studies=
 , since the load is already being served.)
 
 Apparently, Entergy has also changed its mind and now is opposing the 1/1/0=
 2 opening of the Entergy/Texas retail market.
