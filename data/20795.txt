 I have received the information that I needed to officially submit my request 
 for 1/2 vacation Friday.  If this is not feasible, please let me know.
 
 Thanks

 I think I need to take a half day of vacation Friday, Oct. 20th.  I am 
 involved in some church activities next weekend and I won't find out if I 
 need this time off until tonight or Wednesday night.  Is that too short of 
 notice?
