 Chris--see Melissa's note below.....per her note it would appear that part of 
 the capacity we valued in the Wholesale book (not Retail) was not really 
 capacity they owned.  Can you give me the details on this capacity--what term 
 they gave it to us for, rate, receipt and delivery points, volume, etc.  Then 
 we need to look at what impact it will have to take it out of the book.  
 Thanks for the help.

 Colleen,
 
 As I understand it, we were acting as Agent for TCO capacity owned by Titanium
 Metals, and that capacity was incorrectly incorporated into the sale of our
 Wholesale book.  Could you please look into this on your end and let me know
 how to best proceed with correcting this situation.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Melissa (703-561-6408)
