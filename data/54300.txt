 Hi again,
 
 I am visiting several family members and friends over the next few days.
 Therefore it will be hard to contact me.
 
 However, next week I will be easier to reach.  My contact details in NYC are
 as follows. I will be staying at the following hotels:
 
 Washington Square Hotel
 from November 28th for 3 nights (Tue, Wed and Thur)
 212.777.9515
 
 Marriott NYC Financial
 December 1st for 1 night (Fri)
 212.385.4900
 
 
 At any rate, I will still try to reach you on tomorrow morning.  If all
 fails, we will try to reach each other next week.
 
 Happy Thanksgiving,
 Iris
