 
 Another addition to the team.
 
     
 
 FYI - I told Tim earlier that I am in for the EES project.  I expect that you guys are speaking regularly but thought I would send a quick note.
 
 I am working out transition of my existing projects with Jake over the next couple of days.  I am back in Houston on Monday and think I will be available to start at that point.
 
 See you next week - Terry
