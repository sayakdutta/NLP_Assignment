 they call it transportation sciences, no really).  I'll call up there this 
 morn and get back with you....

 I spoke with Geoff Pollock (Stacey Rosen's cousin) who is the logistics mgr 
 at Frigidaire.  He's helping me identify candidates for the transportation 
 group.  He said that the best Logistics school is Wharton.  Can you help me 
 get into their placement office.  Do they have alumni job boards?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Dan
