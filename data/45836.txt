 Tana,
 Sorry to bug you again regarding these contracts.  Any idea when we can 
 expect them?  Tom Myers is asking me for a spreadsheet, but I can't complete 
 it until I have some information from those documents.
 
 If you've already sent them, thank you very much.  If not, any idea when it 
 will be?
