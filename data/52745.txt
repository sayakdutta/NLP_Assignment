 Dear Director Kaminski,
 
 I am an MBA student at Rice University. Through our director Peter Veruki's
 introduction, I expressed my interest in having a summer intern or part-time
 job at your department by email and by talking with you in telephone in
 June. Now I am taking my summer intern at JP Morgan Chase. Since your
 department is called the development brain of Enron, I am still very
 interested in having a learning opportunity to work part-time under your
 direction. My updated resume is attached. I will call you next Monday
 morning to follow up. Thank you for your consideration.
