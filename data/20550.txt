 
 Hey, I've got a "devil" of an idea to try to keep our weekend from becoming "hellish."
 
 Should we start emailing what we need to do/get?
 
 I can go to Rainbow on Thursday night to get staples (understanding that there may be some speciality items that we can pick up out there, e.g., oysters, cowgirl creamery, knave of hearts bakery, etc.
