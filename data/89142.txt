 
 We are ok with numbers 1 and 2 of your email with one change.  We would like to place "Associated Costs" in the "Appendix" as a defined term.
 
 Let me know if this is acceptable and I will proceed with execution documents.  I should let you know I am currently waiting on my credit dept. regarding any changes to the numbers in the credit sections.  I hope to have an answer by tomorrow.

 Debra,
 
 when we had our phone conversation earlier this week, I agreed to obtain suggested language for 4.1 more clearly defining "associated costs" we discussed.  My attorney just got back to me and it is attached.
 
 Hopefully, we are good to go now for execution.  If there is anything else, please let me know
 
 thanks
