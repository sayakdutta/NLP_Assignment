 Thanks Tiny. Kim and Darrell let us know how you want to do this and we'll =
 move forward. If we can get some kind of agreement put together with Citize=
 ns on what they need maybe we can do these changes one time. As you know we=
  have had a lot of issues with them since start up.=20
 Thanks

 I'm going to try and clear this up:
 
 Robert Francen (928-226-2219) with Citizens called about the Griffith inter=
 connect a couple of weeks ago.  He made a request that we configure our flo=
 w control valve with a pressure control over-ride and reduce the supply pre=
 ssure to the Citizens station supplying the Griffith power plant.  Although=
  I know the RTU has this capability, I told Robert that I would have to che=
 ck with our Tech folks to see if we had this capability.  My concern was th=
 at by lowering our supply pressure to Citizens it would make it easier to s=
 witch or split flows to the power plant with El Paso.  El Paso's supply pre=
 ssure runs a couple of hundred pounds lower than TW's in this area and they=
  cannot get in to Citizens with incurring huge swings at Citizens and shutt=
 ing TW in currently.  So, simply stated, I did not want to proceed without =
 direction from Marketing or Gas Control.  If I remember correctly when I ca=
 lled and discussed this issue with you a couple of weeks ago, we were in ag=
 reement not do reduce the pressure supply to Griffith but, you were going t=
 o communicate this with them.  I am still getting calls from Robert and I'm=
  not sure how to handle his request at this point. =20
 
 Please do not confuse this issue with the Batching valve that is currently =
 out of service.  Also, do not confuse with Choquettes request to provide pr=
 essure over-ride at this point as that can be done to provide steady state =
 pressure with a flow control over-ride without reducing supply pressure dra=
 matically to this interconnect point.  (However, there is the concern that =
 if we install pressure control with a flow control over-ride that we put ou=
 rselves in the position of reducing this supply pressure over time and then=
  getting into competing issues with El Paso. =20
 
 I do not care how we configure this point.  However, again it could have im=
 plications for marketing and gas control so, I prefer that you all make tha=
 t call.
