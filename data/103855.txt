 you finalize your piece.  The DATE of the earliest trade between ENA and HS 
 Resources is important because we will use that date for the ISDA.  Please 
 verify that date as soon as possible.  Thanks.  Sara

 I have emailed Jim Piccone of HS Resources with a copy of the spreadsheet.  
 My hope is that he and I can determine the cause of the discrepancies and 
 resolve them as quickly as possible.  I will keep each of you posted as to 
 the progress on this issue.  If there are any questions you would like me to 
 ask him, please let me know.
 
 Kevin
