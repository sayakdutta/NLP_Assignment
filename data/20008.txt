 PS  Boeing's lobbyist told Katz today (Davis' point person on 78)that the date must be September 1, period.  Katz told the Boeing lobbyist that the August 25th date is there to "screw Enron." Hedy has confirmed that Raytheon is also working the date issue.
 
 Best,

  Individual Ex Parte Communication Meeting
 
 
 
 As indicated by this ex parte notice, Edison is planning to meet with Bilas
 this week before the continuation meeting on Thursday presumably to try to
 weaken his opposition to the July 1 cut off of direct access.  Edison's
 comments on the proposed decision say that over 6% of their load has
 switched to direct access during the July 1 to September 6 time frame,
 resulting in a total of over 7% of load being served by direct access over
 their entire system at present.  While it appears Bilas is still a strong
 proponent of allowing direct access and should still advocate reducing the
 DWR contract commitements instead of restricting customer options, should
 Enron, or AReM get in to see Bilas (and possibly Brown) to try to prevent
 any backsliding on the 13th.  We have a right to a meeting with Bilas.  A
 meeting with Brown would have to be noticed today or be held only with his
 advisor, Dave Gamson. I would recommend we try for both.
