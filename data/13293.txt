 
 Brian, 
 
 Pat Mackin requested that I forward this on to you.   I think he has a good 
 idea here to look at a process for RIF selection.  Currently, it is done on 
 an ad-hoc basis, with plans being prepared for each situation.  
 
 Pat, do you still have a copy of the one you prepared a while back?  It would 
 be an excellent start.
 
 Thanks.
 
 Michelle
