 Stacy,
  I am trying to assess credit for a new customer, National Gas & Oil 
 Cooperative. I know that there are certain restrictions for financial trading 
 with COOPs, but I am unaware if any restrictions exist for physical gas. Can 
 you please let me know if there is any additional information that we need to 
 obtain before granting credit to this company?
 
 Thanks
