 Hi Jim - 
 
 The Mayor's office wants someone from Enron to speak at the Rebuild America kick-off for approx. 10 to 15 min. on Enron's energy conservation efforts.  Can you recommend someone in Enron that works in this area, like fuel cell development.  The event is Oct 4th and the Assistant Secretary of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy and Dept of Energy, David Garman will be attending.  
 
 
 Thank you for help.
