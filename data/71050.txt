 Eric,
 We are moving ahead to have legal turn a turbine purchase agreement.  As 
 discussed on Tuesday morning, we must turn an offer to People's on Friday 
 July 14.  I want to assure that all parties have provided enough time and 
 attention to 1) review a document 2) provide comments and 3) provide a 
 legally binding (conditioned on ABB requirements) offer to PEC.
 

 
 Thanx,
 Laura
