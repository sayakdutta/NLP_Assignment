 Hi,
 I'd like to make a personal invitation to you to attend RDI's annual user
 conference at Torrey Pines in La Jolla, just north of San Diego.  We are
 planning two sessions for GPCM users (and prospective users) which I think
 you will find very interesting and useful.  Plus we are also going to
 schedule individual sessions for those that would like them, as was quite
 successful last year.  The details are included in the attached Word file
 below.  I've also included the program in pdf format.  The last page is a
 signup form you can fill out and fax in to RDI if you haven't already done
 so.
 Please let me and Mike know how many are coming from your team.  You can
 reply to this e-mail to let us know.
 Looking forward to seeing you there.
 I think it's going to be fun.
 Bob Brooks
 Mike Farina
