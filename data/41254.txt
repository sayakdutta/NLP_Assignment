 As you can see below, I just replied to Mark instead of forwarding to you.  Credit is not throwing you off.  They did send a revised worksheet.  I have turned around comments and they have been reviewed by a lawyer.  I have completed finalizing the comments, but since AA sent their agreement in pdf (which cannot be edited), I have had to turn around a hard copy of our comments.  Can you give me a physical address where I can overnight our comments?
 
 Thanks!

 Marie - can you please check on this and let Richard know where we stand.  Thanks!
 
  
     
 According to credit, the AA ISDA worksheet was sent back to legal last week. Have you seen it or are they throwing me off?
