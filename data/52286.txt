 
 Todd,
 
 Thanks for the opportunity to speak at the conference.
 It was a great pleasure to see you again.

 Vince --
 
 Thanks again for participating in Monday's preconference workshop on
 Volatility. Your remarks on modeling volatility and option valuation were
 most appreciated by the attendees and me.
 
 I am sorry you weren't able to make the storage conference on Tuesday and
 Wednesday. It was a very engaging discussion of valuation issues, from many
 different perspectives.
 
 Best wishes in your business activities during these volatile times.
