 In case we have a position open, attached is the resume of a friend of mine, 
 Mirari Barriola. She is primarily a finance attorney and is fluent in 
 Spanish, German and English. Her husband just began the Enron associate 
 program and sent her resume to EI but I thought it would be worthwhile 
 passing it around here. 
 
 
 
 Please let me know if you are interested to meet her.
 
 Many thanks, 
 
 Shari
