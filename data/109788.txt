 
 Tiffany, I'm waiting to hear from Jeff to see if he wants to speak to each of 
 the panelists separately as I am finding it difficult (impossible so far!) to 
 find a time that all are available.  Too many busy people.  I shall be back 
 in touch with you as soon as I can have the conversation with Jeff.  My 
 apologies for the delays and slow communication.  Thanks very much for your 
 patience.  SRS

 Unfortunately I jump on a plane Thur at 430pm EDT and don't think that leaves 
 enough of a gap to make Jeff's availability. Can we try to reschedule 
 conversation?
 
 I have copied my assistant, Tiffany Roach, on this message to help 
 coordinate. 
 
 Thanks, 
 
 David
