 Dear Sara,
 
 With respect to our recent exchange of voice-mail messages,
 I await to receive from you at your earliest opportunity
 a draft of the Amendment to the Credit Support Annex between
 Enron North America Corp. and Cargill, Incorporated.
 
 I have also been advised by our Credit Department that we are
 to begin negotiations on an ISDA Master Agreement between Enron
 North America Corp. and Cargill-Alliant, LLC.  We assume the
 ISDA being amended above would serve as a basis for this new
 Agreement.  Could you please advise if you will also be handling
 negotiation of the Cargill-Alliant, LLC ISDA?
 
 Regards,
 Mara Alexander
