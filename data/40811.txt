 
 Great Ideas.
 
  
     
 fyi - Brian Stanley asked me to join him in a meeting to discuss a potential sale of EEOS to some financial investors.  Was not aware	
 
 Also, are you aware of any monetization of the PGE "pre-sale"? Davis Thames, Paul Puchot (corpdev lawyer) and I may have an interesting idea on how we can get a perfected security interest in the future sales proceeds from the PGE sale.  Paul is an outstanding bankruptcy attorney who may have found a way, through the recently revised UCC, to accomplish this.  I did not want to spend much time on this if someone else was already working on it.  Sounds interesting, and I haven't heard anyone else talk about it.
 
 On an unrelated topic, at some point, you and I should sit down with Jeff to discuss financing roles/responsibilities of EGS.  I would like to see less corp financing of EGS assets (especially when we are unaware of them a la TOPRs), since we will have to live with these deals post mortem.    I agree
