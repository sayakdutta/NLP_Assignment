 To all subcommittee members:
 
     Attached is the final draft which is being sent to TMOS for
 approval.  Because the participants voted 7 to 3 to keep sections 5.2
 and 5.3 as they are currently drafted, no changes were made to those
 sections.  I reviewed and used most of TXU's and Southern's edits
 regarding typos and clarification, which I appreciate.  If you would
 like to see the changes, then go to Track Changes and highlight on
 screen.
 
     Thank you all for your help. Hopefully this agreement will be
 approved at TMOS and then TAC.  I will (or Naim) will keep you apprised.
