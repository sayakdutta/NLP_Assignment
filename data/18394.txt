 
 So does this mean we're right where we left off with respect to status of 
 bills like wind-fall profits, jails for generators, etc.?

 At the request of Senate President Pro Tem John Burton and Senate
 Minority Leader Jim Brulte, the Senate desk has arranged for the
 preparation of all First Ex bills for reintroduction as Second Ex bills,
 retaining the same numbers. These measures will be redrafted in their
 last First Ex version or, in the case of those already having reached
 the Assembly, in the form in which they left the Senate.
 
 It is the intention of the President Pro Tem to move all measures in the
 new extraordinary session to the same place they remained at the end of
 the first extraordinary session.
