 Sounds like we will be dealing with Rodger Swenke and not Bob Betonte or Richard Ishiwaka on GISB issues from now on.  Does anyone know Rodger or know what his duties are at Socal Gas?
 
 
 

  
 
 Dear Executive Committee Members, Alternates and Participants,
 
 It is with regret that I inform you that Bob Betonte with SoCal Gas will no 
 longer represent the LDC segment on our EC.  Bob has been with the EC for 
 many years and he has worked with his colleagues on the EC though many thorny 
 issues.  Clearly, his contributions will be missed.  A voluntary effort such 
 as ours would not be successful without the generous donation of the time and 
 efforts of committee members such as Bob, and the willingness of SoCal Gas to 
 support Bob's participation in our organization.
 
 The LDC segment ran its election and voted to support Rodger Swenke, Senior 
 Pipeline Products Project Manager, SoCal Gas, to take the open seat on the 
 EC.  Please join me in welcoming Rodger to our committee; and thanking Bob 
 for all his efforts and wishing him well in his new job assignments with 
 SoCal Gas.     
 
 Best Regards,  Rae
