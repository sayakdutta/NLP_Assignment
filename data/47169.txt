 do with the Bankers Trust trades.  In particular, they haven't thought 
 through what they want to do with the online trades, don't like on online 
 documentation, and now they think they may want to do a full novation of the 
 trades once they decide how to resolve this.  So, until we hear back from 
 them (they said in about a week), just let the Bankers Trust financial trades 
 and master sit.
