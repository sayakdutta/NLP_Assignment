  Do you have anything?  If so, let me know and we'll make arrangements to get 
 it.  Thanks.

                       Attorney-Client Privileged Communication
 
 
 Since litigation has begun with Sempra, Somerset and Blue Grass, we should
 see to it that documents relating to the issues in the lawsuit are
 preserved.  For this purpose documents include not only hard copy but also
 documents and information in electronic form and on voice or video
 recordings.
 It may well be that you will have questions on how to implement this
 practice and more specifically what documents are covered. My suggestion is
 that we start by trying to see that documents are not discarded and
 determining what questions and issues there are.  Feel free to contact me
 for guidance as you go forward.  It may well be that we should have a
 conference call to see that everyone  is using the same procedures and to
 address common issues.  If you think that would be desirable let me know.
 We also need to see that other people who should get this notice have it
 forwarded to them so that Enron's compliance is complete.
