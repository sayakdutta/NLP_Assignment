 I believe that James Centilli will also be attending this meeting.  
 
 Thanks, Kim.
 
  
     
 Thanks, Kim!   I hadn't quite made it through all of my e-mails, when I looked at Stan's Monday calendar and realized I didn't have a location for this meeting, so I called you to inquire.    Sorry for the oversight.
