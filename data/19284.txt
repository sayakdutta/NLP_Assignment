 
 Got Mark's number.  I'm going to call him today.  Any specific info you'd like to have, or just generally what he and DWR are up to on the gas side.  I also assume that we'd like to meet with him to discuss possible opportunities?
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Thanks, BT 
 
  
     
 Greetings:
 
 1) I haven't forgot about Baldwin, but it seems that things have changed for him (and his company?).  His long-standing number know longer works and there's no forwarding number.  I'm trying to track him down.
 
 2) What time's your weekly meeting on Thursday, and is there a call-in number?
 
 Best,
 Jeff
