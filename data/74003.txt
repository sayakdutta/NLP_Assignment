  enovate.  
 
 Per our conversation this morning, please revise the name change documents to 
 reflect enovate with a lower case "e" rather than Enovate.
 
 We will be distributing marketing materials in Illinois, Indiana, Texas, 
 Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa, Alberta (Canada).  
 
 Thanks for your assistance.  Let me know if you need anything.
