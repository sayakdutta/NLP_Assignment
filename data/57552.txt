 Phil, Karen, Kathy, Steve,
 
 Diane and I are finally getting a will written.  I would like to ask all of
 you if you have any objections to being named in the will as executors OR
 executing an Advanced Health Care Directive.  An AHCD is document inwhich
 Diane and I will state what our wishes are regarding life support.  I have
 attached a sample copy for review.  If anyone objects, please reply to me in
 the next 10-14 days.  We will be meeting with the lawyer sometime around the
 15th or 16th.
