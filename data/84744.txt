 
 What time is the tailgate kicking off?  I am still driving in on Saturday 
 morning.  Not sure if I have any 70s stuff, but I will take a look.  Need a 
 tie dye.  
 
 
 
 

    
 
 
 Gerald,
 
 If you have any 70's clothes bring it. The tailgate has a 70's theme and
 will have a dj and everything. It's going to be a blast. Are you still
 coming in on Saturday?
