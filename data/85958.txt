 In case you  haven't heard...
 We've postponed our move for a few months (sometime  between now and December) due the the non-sale of our home here in  Houston.  Not to worry, we can still start our Master's degrees through  NOVA's distance education program.  
  
 Since we're  still here, we're offering beginner and continuing education scuba lessons  this fall.  Our schedule is posted at www.scubadoobydoo.com .
 Please call or email if you'd like to enroll.
