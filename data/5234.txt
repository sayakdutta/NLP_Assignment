 hey everyone it is you lucky day!  i forgot to put a few things into my 
 famous friday state of the union.  first, i have picked up cooking recently.  
 i am a regular emeril.  for my roommate matt's b-day i decided to make him an 
 ice cream cake.  it looked so delicious.  i used cookie dough ice cream with 
 an oreo cookies crust and whip cream.  for flavor i added two sticks of 
 butter (the recipe calls for zero).  it looked so good that i ate it all 
 before matt got home.  lucky for me matt came home in time to give me the 
 hymlec's because i was choking to death on a stick of butter.  i am 
 dissapointed though because i spilled ice cream all over my shirt and matt's 
 carpet.  if anyone needs the recipe please call.
 
 i did have a date this week with some girl (we will call her X).  we went to 
 dinner and had appetizers, main course, desert and wine.  well, i had wine.  
 we then went to my favorite bar.  i got a little buzzed so i let her drive my 
 car.  X got made because i took a nap on the way home and she had to potato 
 sack me into the house.  why do they call it "landry loaded"?
 
 i have been working out lately.  my friends still like to call me dough boy.  
 i think they are jealous that i am so carved up.  god i am tan!
 
 keep in touch

 ps-  please foward to our friends not on the distribution who would love to 
 read my state of the union
