 
 FYI.  I had previously asked Paul to revise the LM contract to remove all of 
 the references to WestLB.

 Kay:  references to WestLB are in only a few places in the GE Contract; 
 namely, the recitals and sections 3.8(c)(2), 5.1, 6.1, 7.2.4, 30.7 and 
 30.12.  The references in the recitals, 3.8(c),7.2.4, 30.7 and 30.12 can be 
 handled fairly easily.  The references in 5.1 and 6.1 deal with pricing 
 matters and will require a little work once the pricing mechanism is worked 
 out with GE.  My suggestion would be to not revise the document at this time 
 and make these changes at the same time we make any other changes arising 
 from the discussions with GE.  PLease let me know what you think.  Regards, 
 Paul
 

 
 Thanks.  This is a  very drastic situation, so the draft will be
 appreciated.
 
 As I recall you were going to turn another draft of the GE facility
 agreement, deleting the WestLB references.  When will this be forthcoming?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay

 Peter Thompson is working on it.  We should have a draft Wednesday.

 Paul,
 
 When can we expect a draft of the ABB facility agreement? It is getting
 urgent.
 
 Thanks,
