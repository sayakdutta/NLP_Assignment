 The PWC guys said that 1:30 would be fine.  I have also asked them to email Chris and Bjorn with their requests.  If it is alright with you, we will plan to meet at your desk at 1:30.  What is your location again?
 
 Thanks,
 Susan

 Susan,
 
 I am busy this morning.  Can we do this early this afternoon, say at 1:30?
 
 Also can you please send an email to my supervisor Chris Constantine and our main business user Bjorn Hagelmann to outline what the request is.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Wei
