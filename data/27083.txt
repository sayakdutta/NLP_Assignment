    y, John M.
  
 I received a voice mail from Mike Curry, asking if I was still an Enron Emp=
 loyee and what had happened to the regulatory reports that I used to send. =
  Here are the answers.  Yes, I am still an Enron employee. As for the repor=
 ts, I have been negligent in sending then around over the past few weeks.  =
 The meeting schedule has increased at ERCOT and due to the high congestion =
 costs a Congestion Management working group has been formed to address, the=
  move to the full zonal model, auction of TCR products, local congestion is=
 sues etc.  I have been asked to chair the working group which has taken mor=
 e time.  Finally, I have had an ill daughter and they have been running tes=
 ts to diagnose the cause of the problem, therefore, I have been traveling b=
 ack and forth to and from Austin on a daily basis.  All of this has cut int=
 o the time that I used to write the reports and have tried to contact the p=
 arties directly when an issue arose.  However, I understand the need to dis=
 seminate the regulatory information and will resume the summaries forthwith=
 .  You should expect to get a summary of the last weeks activities this p.m=
