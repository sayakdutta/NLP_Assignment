 David and Elizabeth,
 
 Here are the redlined versions of the NSP amendments.  The changes are 
 straight forward.  The only thing that I found was that they only changed the 
 date in one of the agreements...they should probably be changed in both.  
 Please review and resend to me at your earliest convenience.  Our goal is to 
 execute tomorrow.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Terri

 Minimal changes have been added (in highlight).  I think we should be able
 to get these ready for signatures by end of day tomorrow!  If you have any
 questions, please give me a call.  Thanks again for all your help and hard
 work.  Talk to you tomorrow, have a good evening.
