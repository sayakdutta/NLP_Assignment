 John,
 
 Are we papering ECC's financial trades with BP Corporation North America (BPCNA) under the ISDA that we have between ENA and BPCNA and just back to backing our trades between ENA and ECC???  I am not trying to be a pain in the butt...but... I just want to make sure we are covered.  Please advise.
