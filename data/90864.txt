 
 PLEASE NOTE:
 
 Dutch's cell number is 713-417-9037
 
 the guard is in the building not the garage
 
 
 
 
  
     
 Here are the directions to Enron.  Call Dutch's cell number if you get lost,
 confused, or whatever.  Draft starts at 11am.  Please let us know if you
 find anyone that wants to join the league!!!  I also need a list of names if
 you are bringing a friend that we can leave with the guard, otherwise I will
 just leave the names of the various owners.
 
 Dutch's Cell Number:  713-471-9037
 
 Later,
 
 Kevin
