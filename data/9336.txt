 Sally,
 
 The following attachment is the latest example of the "Curve Validation 
 Summary" that we have in "soft copy" form.
 We do have several, more recent, hard copies of the curve validation summary, 
 but we felt that this attachment would better facilitate you.
 
 
 
 
 Sincerely, 
 
 Jack Ehrig
