These actions are important to preserving the value of what Dynegy is buying.  The merger agreement, of course, has a "no shop" provision, and it has provisions, as I understand it, to make sure Enron continues to run the business prudently. That's what we are doing.

 This deal depends on the support of your forces - I understand that folks
 are upset at ENE mgt particularly Ken's sweetheart deal
 
 What are the chances you guys try to wiggle out of this once we stabilize
 you?  I've got to account for that on the Street if it's a real possiblity!
