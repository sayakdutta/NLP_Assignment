 Please find attached a confirmation for this deal ("sampledoc").  I have changed the floating price language to reflect an Asian option (which I have never confirmed before), as opposed to our standard European options.  The standard floating price language for European Options is as follows:
 
 The average of the hourly day-ahead prices as published by the New York Independent System Operator (the "NYISO") on the last day of the month that includes the applicable Determination Period on the NYISO's official web site currently located at http://mis.nyiso.com/public/index.html, or any successor thereto, under the headings "Day Ahead Market LBMP - Zonal; Zonal Prices; West (61757) (Zone F)" for electricity during the applicable Determination Period.
 
 Please review the "Floating Price" section of this confirmation letter.

 Please let me know if this confirmation correctly reflects an Asian option.  The trader would like for this confirmation to go out no later than today.  Please call me if you have any questions.
 Thank You,
