 All,
 
 Please find attached what is now the latest and (subject to minor 
 adjustments), the final version of the future Enron Metals North America 
 organizational structure.
 
 Effective November 1, the Montreal, Chicago and St Louis office's have been 
 reconfigured into Agency offices.  I would like to thank all of you for your 
 support and cooperation during this integration phase.  Clearly more work 
 needs to be done but the major risk and control issues have been addressed.
 
  
 Best regards,
 Marcelo 
 Enron Metals & Commodity Corp.
