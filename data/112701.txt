 
 My understanding is that Jim Wood is making the recommendation on Etown. Correct?

 Wade,
 
 	Elizabethtown is requesting a $250,000 margin be posted by 5:00 p.m. Dec 20th to remain active behind their citygate. E-town is one of the NJ markets we have chosen to remain active behind and preserve the $1.4 MM of MTM value. E-town will be forwarding to me their w/t instructions today which I will have Kathryn Gonzales forward to you with the amount and details. Let me or Don know if you have any questions. Thanks.
