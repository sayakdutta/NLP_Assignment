 My Uncle lives an "alternative lifestyle" as well...I really don't much being around him either, but its not b/c of his sexual orientation, or lack there-of. I would enjoy consensus for once, however...
 
 
     
 Brian has sent the FINAL PLAN and that is where I will be, even if it is 
 alternative lifesyle night. Last time we went there was a thursday night, no 
 big deal.
