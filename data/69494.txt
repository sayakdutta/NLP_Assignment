 Hi Paul,
  
 Ran into "Tim" at Sambuca's Friday night, and he was wondering what happened to our "get together" we were supposed to have several weeks ago????
 I told him I hadn't heard back from you, therefore assumed you were not interested. He said he thought you were out of town a great deal, but was going to e-mail you because he wants possibly to set something up with us four. (Myself, Carolyn and you two)
 No problem if you are too busy, believe me I understand.........or whatever the reason might be. 
  
 Take care,
 Debbe.
