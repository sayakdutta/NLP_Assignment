 
 Charlene,
 
 Please, help. This is a son of a professor at Berkeley who helps me a lot in 
 the recruiting process.
 His son goes to Cornell. Can we invite him (the son, not the professor) to a 
 Super Saturday? I really want
 to repay the debt to his father who is very instrumental in  my recruiting 
 efforts.
 
 Vince
