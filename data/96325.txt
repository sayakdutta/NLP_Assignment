 Ms. Sager,
 
 The printer that was originally recommended by the IT technician for Genia 
 FitzGerald is not capable of handling her printouts.  He has determined that 
 she needs a larger printer and he recommends the following:
 
  Black/white Network Printer HP 4100N in the amount of $1,503.00
 
 If this meets with your approval, please forward this message to Janette 
 Elbertson.
 
 
 Thank you,
 Martha Keesler
