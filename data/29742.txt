 FYI, I understand from John Barquin that he has decided to take a 1 year 
 leave of absence from V&E, starting Feb 1.  Cuiab? will be continue to be 
 covered by Cliff Rankin and Steve Tarry and the rest of the V&E team.  In 
 addition, John will be available for consultation on historical matters as 
 necessary.
 
 Regards,
  John
