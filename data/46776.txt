 
 I am unable to send you those DynegyDirect docs because my file is missing.  
 I have tried unsuccessfully to locate it, so I am contacting the Online Team 
 right now trying to get copies from them.  As soon as I get copies I will get 
 you copies.

 Please send a copy of the executed DynegyDirect ETA with Addendum between 
 Enron North America and Dynegy to Will Fredercking at EB854B.
 
 Thanks.
