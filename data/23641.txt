 Stacy - 
 After speaking with Rudwell about the credit amendment to the Master, I have 
 made revisions to the attached document to reflect our conversation.  
 Basically, Allegheny Energy Supply Company, LLC is an independently rated 
 entity.  As such, we will not be receiving a Parent Guarantee on their 
 behalf.  I think I have removed the references to the parent guarantee, but 
 can you please review the attached to make sure I did not miss anything.  
 
 Rudwell - If I mistated anything, please let us know.
 
 Thanks - 
 
 Gregg

 Attached please find the amendment to the enovate/Allegheny Energy Master 
 Firm Agreement covering the credit provisions.  Please review and give me 
 your comments.
