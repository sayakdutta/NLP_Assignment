 It happened twice
 
 
     
 
 Cara,
 Did the error take place again, or did it just happen the one time.  If it
 just happened the 1 time, everything is ok, the server that you were on just
 restarted that piece of code.  If it is continually happening, please let me
 know right away.  From the logs that I was able to look at, everything
 looked fine so I think the server just restarted that piece of code.  Please
 let me know if it keeps happening.
 Thank you,
 Mary Tollefson
