 
 Chris Foster has requested that we set up a new broker - the Automated Power 
 Exchange, in EnPower. It is the same counterparty we already have in EnPower, 
 with the same name and contact information. Melissa, I believe you said we 
 could pretty easily add the name in the broker list if it was the same as in 
 the counterparty list, which Chris has verified it is. Please let me know if 
 you need anymore information.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate
