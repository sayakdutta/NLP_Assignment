 Mark,
 
 I have attached two word documents for your review, both of which contain the 
 two long descriptions.  The document with filename TAS Descriptions most 
 likely will be two new product types.  The other document (Nymex-GC Spreads) 
 shows the long descriptions for the existing product type US HeatOil2 Fin 
 Spread and US UNL Fin Spread.  We will create a new index for each of these 
 product types that will be the Nymex vs Gulf Coast prices for the commodity.  
 Savita has reviewed each of these documents and her only concern is how we 
 capture the "Trade Date" for the TAS products.  These products have been 
 requested by Larry Gagliardi, Phil Clifford, and John Wilson.  Please let me 
 know your thoughts.
 
 Thank you.
 Kevin
