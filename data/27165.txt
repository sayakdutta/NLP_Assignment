 Please see the attached spreadsheet for Friday.   All of the deals listed  have been moved to Teco Services for this day only.      We entered a buy (which is an estimate of the cost of gen)  and the appropriate sales.  We need to talk about how this gets reconciled.    I would like to know the detail of this transaction.    
 I know that not everything has been discussed with this account,  so I would like to discuss it.
 
 I am positive that I need to change all deals for over the weekend.   We had some length for this customer that was sold hourly.     I assume that everything from now on will be entered under Teco Services for this account.
 Can you think of any exceptions?  
 
 I will let you know when the weekend is complete.
 
 
 Thanks,
 JMF
