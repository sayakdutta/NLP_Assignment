 
 They are good deals, but we don't have deal numbers because Mike is out of 
 the office right now and said he wanted to check with the broker personally 
 before verifying the price. He's aware that the deals will have to go in late 
 and be backdated, and that they will not be in his calculation for the day. 
 Please let me know if there's anything else I can do.
