 
 Just wanted to follow up and make sure we were still on for tomorrow?  Can we make it 12:15 at Chucks BarBQue?  I have your numbers and will give you a call if we run into trouble.  Thanks.

 Phillip ... greetings from Auburn, where in 9 days the eagle will fly, the
 stadium will rock and the tigers will welcome ball state to our newly named
 "jungle."
 
 WE have this week received the $12,500 matching money from Enron.
 
 Also, can you email me your work number again. I think the dean of the vet
 school wants to call and say thanks for setting up the scholarship.
 
 I still have you on my calendar for a tour of the raptor center on Friday,
 Oct. 12, the day before we (am I getting giddy here?) shock the number one
 ranked gators.
