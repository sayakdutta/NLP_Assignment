 Vince,
 
 Do you want 3 offers extended or 5?  I just noticed that you plan to fax two 
 additional resumes.  If so, when can I expect the additional resumes?

 Vince,
 
 I will handle the offer letters for the candidates.  I have the resumes for 
 Darten Williams and Sevil Yaman.  I know you only provided the e-mail memo 
 for Paulo Rocha, but I really need his resume in order to capture the 
 necessary information for his offer letter.
 

 
 Thanks,
 
 Karen Marshall
