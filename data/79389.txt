 
 Doug,
 
 Thanks for the email.  I am glad that you had a good meeting.  These guys are 
 good and we are committed to this business.
 
 I'll be at the Masters Wed - Fri.  Are you going to be there during those 
 days?

 Hi Mike.  As you may know, George brought his full team to our office today
 to review certain operational issues in connection with our deal, and to
 introduce key members of the team going forward.  It was very helpful to
 meet the team members, and to understand a bit better how your coal group is
 gearing up to be in a position to fulfill Enron's end of the deal once we
 get the synfuel facility relocated and up and running.  There are a lot of
 administrative and operational issues that AIG-FP, Enron and Aquila,
 collectively, are going to have to work through between now and the
 production start date to ensure that this deal gets off to as smooth a start
 as possible, but this meeting was a good first step, and appreciated on our
 end.
