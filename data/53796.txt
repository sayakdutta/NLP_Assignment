 Thanks Vince - I'll give him a try.
 
 
     
 
 Philip,
 
 Please, try Frank Wolak from Stanford University.
 
 He is the best expert on California right now.

    Vince
 
    Thanks for coming back to me on this anyway. Would you be able to
    suggest
    anyone else - either in Australia, Europe or US who would be good to get
    to
    discuss the California crisis?
 
    kind regards.
 
    Philip
 
    

     
 
    Philip,
 
    I have to decline the invitation with regrets.
    I have too many commitments right now.

       Dear Vince
 
       Just a quick message to follow up on the email that I sent you
    recently
       inviting you to speak at our forthcoming congress, Risk 2001
    Australia,
       which is taking place in Sydney on 20 & 21 August 2001. Have you had
    an
       opportunity to consider the invitation yet? We are aiming to have the
       programme printed next week, so I would really need to know as soon
    as
       possible if you would be available to speak at this year's congress.
 
       I am working from our Hong Kong office for this week only (Tel: +852
       2545
       2710), and I can be contacted by phone there or by email.
 
       Kind regards.
 
       Philip
