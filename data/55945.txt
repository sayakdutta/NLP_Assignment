 My preference is C, because of its portability. The hardware and operating 
 systems
 change so fast that we have to use the most flexible
 development environment.

 I have spoken with Bryan Seyfried and Ben Parsons on the issue of  model 
 development platform, esp for Credit Trading group.  People besides Ben will 
 be modeling in Bryan's group, and C is not a language they know.  One of them 
 is coding in MATLAB, and the IT group is doing Visual Basic.  IT prefers not 
 to support MATLAB, and would also prefer not to support C, because this would 
 make their life easier.  Bryan and Ben need to make a decision as to what is 
 the common platform of choice that is best for them, taking IT in mind.  Ben 
 has said that if the choice is C, he can enforce everybody learn C, and can 
 look into getting some function libraries (if needed).  Similarly, if the 
 choice is VB, he can enforce common use of VB.
 We need to of course ensure that other members of Research can crosscheck the 
 code.
 What are your thoughts on C, VB, or MATLAB?
