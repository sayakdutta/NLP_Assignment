 Help me understand why a DASH is being done for a gas contract?  The DASH process exists to approve uses of capital, not entering into a gas contract?  Am I missing something?
 
  
     
 Attached is the latest DASH we sent to RAC (Michael Tribolet) last night.  Thanks, Fede.

 Find attached the legal risk memo re this matter.  I believe the DASH for the matter has been distributed by Federico Cerisoli earlier this evening.  Please call or email with any questions.
