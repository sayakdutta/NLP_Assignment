 We will cashout the imbalance with the two Koch entities in the following way:
 
 We owe Koch 11,885 mmbtu at $3.90/mmbtu, which equals $46,351.50.
 Koch owes us 13,639 mmbtu at $2.21/mmbtu and 11,720 mmbtu at $2.38/mmbtu, 
 which equals $58,035.79.
 The net of these imbalances is $11,684.29 due to Enron.
 
 Let me know if you have any questions.  I negotiated this with Scott Garrison 
 at Koch.
 
 Thanks,
