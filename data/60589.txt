 Hi Louise,
  
 Here is how I would word it:
  
 Steve Hotte will take over from Beth Perlman as CIO ENA. Anthony Dayao will remain CIO EES but in addition to Anthony's EES resposibilities, he will also assume responsibilty for creating a combined Wholesale/Retail Power Trading and Risk Management system working closely with Steve Hotte.
  
 When I get to the big org announcement I'll have to add some more blurb in.....
  
 I have a really good feeling about this combination. The way I want to take it forward is Steve, Anthony and I working closely on the strategy for EES and ENA.
  
 On the subject of ENA IT Liaison, I had a discussion with Greg. We think that it would be better to have Beth completely out of the picture for the reasons I initially stated. An initial suggestion was that Jeff Richter might be a good fit, given his IT background and commercial understanding, although he'd have to move back from Portland. I think Barry Pearce would be great. Give me a few days and I'll see if I can come up with some other names, maybe someone from Europe ?
  
 Best Regards
