 
 My understanding now on this is that we are talking about the Bridgeline 
 deal.  In that deal, Enron and Texaco both assigned employees to work for the 
 Bridgeline entity.  It is done under a secundment arrangement, and the 
 employees are sent there via an assignment letter.   (Pat, you may recall 
 that we visited about this process a while back, although I may not have 
 given you the transaction name at the time).  
 
 So, currently, all Enron personnel assigned to Bridgeline actually are Enron 
 employees.  I am not aware of any change to that structure.  Fran, do you 
 know of any changes?  Are we now going to transfer all of those employees to 
 the Bridgeline entity?  Those answers would help.

 << Wilson suggested I contact you to obtain answers to the same desk issue as
  it relates to these employees.  I don't have a lot of information on this
  deal nor does Dee and we are not sure if employees can take a distribution
  from our plan. >>
 
 Mikie and Wilson,
 
 Please send me a copy of the transaction document, or if there is not one,
 the letter of intent.
 
 Will there be a sale of assets?
 
 Will Texaco have any continuing obligation to provide Enron with services in
 connection with the transaction?
 
 Will Texaco be required to make  offers of employment to Enron employees?
 
 I can't respond to the question about the same desk rule unless I know all of
 the facts.  Earlier this year, in Rev Rul 2000-27 the IRS relaxed the same
 desk rule to a sale of less than substantially all of the assets of a
 business.  I need to understand the facts of the Texaco transaction to
 determine if there is a fit.
 
 Generally, an "outsourcing," pursuant to which the third party service
 provider offers employment to Enron employees and thereafter provides
 services to Enron, is subject to the same desk rule.
