 can you take care of this?
 
 
  
     
 Kam,
 
 I'm trying to draft over a volume but can't get it to because the referenced index does not have any values in the table.  Can I get you to change the index on deal 605991 to NWPL.STANFIELD.GDP.D.A (from NWPL.STANFIELD.GD.M.I.).  I need the $6.32 price on the 8th.
 
 Thanks,
