 Like down by the swimming pool with Geneva Holland?  He was sooo tanked I had 
 Carlos go to take him to his room (but some nice female helped him instead).
 
 
   
  
 On which day?  I don't recall being any worse than anyone else.

 Kay,
 
 Would you say that Travis McCullough was just a tad tipsy (to the point of 
 being intoxicated) at the Law Conference?  Carlos does not believe me.
