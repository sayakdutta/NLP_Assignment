 
 Sue,
 
 I am sending you this e-mail because I received your voice message well after 
 you left it today.  I reviewed the text files that are sent out by the book 
 administrators on my desks and none of them contain any deals booked to the 
 counterparty El Paso Gas Marketing.  All of the deals from people on my desk 
 are booked to the valid El Paso counterparty per our conversations.
 
 I will be out of the office tomorrow, but I will be checking my voicemail 
 frequently and communicating with my group.  If the same problem arises 
 tomorrow, please call me at 713-305-1502 so that we can discuss, because 
 there has to be some other explanation for the erroneous counterparty showing 
 up on your report.
 
 Thank you,
