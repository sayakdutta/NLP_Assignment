 
 Jake mentioned Delta but not Panda.  I'm with you - go Delta.  Who wants to 
 mess with the broker issue?
 
 Ciao,

 Steve Thome just called with an update:
 
 - Panda will be providing comments next week 
 
 - Sunlaw dropped out because California rescinded its fast track permit 
 approval process and thus Sunlaw will not have permits for the facilities it 
 wants
 
 - Delta will provide comments on Monday
 
 Have a good weekend.  Go Delta they're the remaining high bidder.
