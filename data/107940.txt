 As part of our process of developing a cohesive strategy for the crude & 
 products origination group, we are hosting a "Strategy Session" on Wednesday, 
 February 21 starting at 3:30 p.m.  It is expected to run about 3 hours.  The 
 location has not yet been determined but my assistant, Beth Ryan (x57161) 
 will confirm this next week.  This meeting replaces the prior meeting set up 
 for Thursday, 2/22 from 8 am to noon.  Representatives from McKinsey will 
 also participate/direct this meeting as facilitators to our strategic 
 process.  We're finalizing an agenda which will be forwarded to you once it 
 is complete.  (de la Roche/Terlip - please be sure this gets sent to all 
 attendees asap).
 
 
 This will be a very important process which we feel your input is critical 
 and valuable.  I want to encourage everyone to not only attend but to be 
 proactive in the process as well.  This will start as somewhat of a 
 "brainstorming" session but our plan is to evolve into a definitive set of 
 priorities, opportunities and action items which we hope will create value 
 across both the trading and origination groups.  Given the size of the group, 
 it has been very challenging finding a convenient time and place to 
 accomodate everyone but I hope each of you will do what you can to attend.  
 We've purposefully started the meeting late to try and accomodate the 
 traders' schedule needs.
 
 
 
 BETH:
 
 WE NEED TO GET EITHER A CONF ROOM (preferably) OR RESERVE A MEETING ROOM AT 
 THE DOUBLETREE, HYATT OR WEDGE TOWER, ETC... FOR THIS MEETING.
 PLEASE CHECK THE DISTRIBUTION LIST ABOVE AND COMPARE AGAINST YOUR LIST OF 
 ORIGINAL INVITES TO THIS MEETING.  IF I'VE MISSED SOMEONE, PLEASE BE SURE 
 THEY ARE NOTIFIED OF THE CHANGE IN DATE, TIME AND PLACE.  ALSO, BE SURE TO 
 LET MCKINSEY KNOW THE LOCATION AS WELL.
