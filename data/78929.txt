 Daren notified me today that he has accepted a job with AEP.  He is willing to stay for a week or so to help in our transition.  I wanted to know what your thoughts were about moving Chris Germany from the Estate to the Manager of Logistics/Transportation role for the Texas Desk.  If you agree I would like to have him spend time with Daren while he is still here.  Let me know your thoughts.
