 Hello My Favorite Problem Child!! (Just kidding!)
 
 You truly only have 27 hrs remaining.  What is confusing is the "entitlement" 
 piece.  What that means that as of 7/1/00 you had 75 hrs remaining when we 
 moved to SAP.  You begain the year with 126 hrs, took 51 hrs prior to 7/1/00 
 leaving you 75 hrs.  After 7/1/00 you took 48 hrs leaving you with 27 hrs as 
 your balance.  Hope this helps!
 
 Mary - can you help Jeff with his deferral enrollment?  He apparently does 
 not have that piece on his eHRonline.  He is way out in San Francisco and a 
 really nice guy - can you help him please???
 
 Regards,
 Michelle
 
 
 

    
 Hi Michelle:
 
 Guess who?  Just went into Ehronline and noticed that under vacation it sez 
 that I'm entitled to 75 hours of vacation, and that I've used 48 hours, 
 leaving 27.  I think that I'm actually entitled to more than 75 hours.  
 Please tell me that I am.  Thanks very much.
 
 Signed,
 Desperately in need of vacation
 
 Also, I clicked on deferral enrollment, and by-golly if I couldn't find the 
 election form to download.  Am I just clueless, or is there another place 
 that I need to look for it?  Thanks a million.
