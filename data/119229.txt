 David,
 
 Thanks for your patience. We are working hard on getting Coral and BP
 North America on board with the ring trades.
 
 I have another counterparty that may want to ring out some ATM Chicago
 basis. Let me know about that.
 
 I have also enclosed the language that would tie all these trades
 together.
 
 Thanks,
