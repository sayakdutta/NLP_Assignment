 when we get in and let you know our details.  I look forward to seeing you, 
 Mary Lou, and Peter, if available.  See you soon!  Michelle
 
 
 
 

    
 
 
 
  Michelle: The tickets went out FedEx today.  If they don't show up
 at the appropriate time tomorrow, give me a call and we'll track them down.
