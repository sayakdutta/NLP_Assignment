 Mary,
 I told you I had a picture of Stan's new addition - here it is.  dn
 
 
  
 
  
 
 Hi,
 
 Over the past weeks, I have been staying at home with my new daughter (a
 picture is attached, though it does not do her justice).  Monday, March 12,
 I intend to return to the office.
 
 My sense is that Paul Mohler has been doing a fine job running the rate
 case.  I hope you agree -- if not, please tell me.  I intend to start
 reintegrating myself into the RTO West/TransConnect work, and will call to
 discuss -- I'm writing now to get you thinking about it.
 
 Stan
