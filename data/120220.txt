 Folks,
 
 Who is planning on attending the virtual bidding seminar in NY?
 
 Tom.
 
  
     
 

 
 NYISO opens its Virtual Marketplace on November 1. Whether you've
 registered to participate in it, are considering doing so, or are
 interested in its potential impact on the existing markets, you'll want to
 attend one of the two upcoming seminars scheduled for October 16 and 29.
 
 The programs will cover:
      NYISO bidding fundamentals - a short overview for those new to the
 NYISO marketplace
      Virtual Transaction basics
      Virtual Transaction entry
      Virtual Transaction charges
      Billing
      Credit requirements
      Illustrations and examples
      Market Monitoring functions involving Virtual Transactions
 
 Each one-day program will be intensive and practical. It will address your
 virtual bidding options and the impact these bids will have on prices in
 both the day-ahead and real-time markets. It will give you a good picture
 as to how this market works and how your participation may be advantageous
 to you.
 
 The day-ahead and real-time markets will change as a result of this new
 option. Therefore, this course will be extremely valuable, not only to
 those bidding virtual transactions, but also to everyone bidding load or
 supply in the existing energy markets.
 
 The course will be run on the following dates as indicated:
      October 16     Albany Marriott, 189 Wolf Road, Albany, New York
      October 29     Desmond Hotel, 660 Albany-Shaker Road, Albany, New York
 
 Course Registration will begin at 8:00 am and the course will start at 8:30
 am. Wrap-up each day will be by 4:00 pm.
