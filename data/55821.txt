 
 Steve,
 
 The Journal of Risk is a more technical and serious publication
 than RISK MAgazine.
 
 If the article is published it will give you more exposure in 
 the academic circles.  I think it will be a significant
 accomplishment.
 
 On the downside, it does not receive the same wide circulation as RISK
 among the practitioners.
 
 I can also see the reason behind the recommendation given
 by Navroz: the article is fairly long for RISK.

 Any thoughts on this proposal?

 Steven,
 After further consultation with the Technical  Editor, we feel that your work 
 would find a more suitable environment for  exposure in The Journal of Risk.
 ?
 If you email a copy of your work (to the  Editor-in-Chief, Philippe Jorion) 
 and outline what has happened to:
 ?

 ?
 then I am sure that they will be keen to give due  consideration.
 ?
 Thank you for your interest and sorry for the delay in coming  to this 
 decision.
 ?
 Best Wishes,
