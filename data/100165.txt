 Things have been very depressing with Enron going under!
 I will talk with Pat tonight and figure out the best way to go forward.

 Hi Jim.  
  
 We have narrowed our choice of vehicles to two minivans: a Toyota Sienna and
 a Chrysler Town & Country. 
 
 Surprisingly, Ben helped us eliminate SUV's from consideration. He prefers
 the smoother ride of the minivan. It will be better for taking long trips.
 The down side is he doesn't want to be seen driving a minivan once he turns
 16. Ha! : ) 
 
 We were able to help satisfy Anna (and Ben) by choosing a higher-end minivan that has
 many "bells and whistles" on it, yet still costs less than an SUV.
 
 We are leaning toward the Toyota, even though it is a bit smaller than the
 Chrysler, because of its reliability and how it holds its resale value. The
 Toyota dealer also has "$300 over invoice" sale on currently. Plus they told
 Mark there will be additional financing incentives starting this Saturday.
 Both the Toyota and Chrysler dealers have vehicles in inventory we can
 choose from. 
 
 So, we hope to close the deal with the Toyota dealer this coming Saturday.
 What do you think?
  
 Love,
 Linda
