 
 Correct again....This deal has been changed. Also, I've forwarded these last 
 two e-mails to Bill Williams III, Real Time manager, who can talk to these 
 guys about using correct counterparty names in deal entry. In the future if 
 you see errors or discrepancies in deals done by the Short Term West Hourly 
 desk, please send the e-mail to Bill and myself. This will hopefully be a 
 more direct way of nipping the problem in the bud.
 
 Thanks for your help.

 Sorry to keep bugging you.  I think this deal is in as the wrong TransAlta.
 
 Thanks!
