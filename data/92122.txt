 Ladies,
 
 Could you please provide Tammie with a copy of the reports every morning.  
 Tammie is the assistant for Louise Kitchen and will require the same report 
 distribution that John receives.
 
 Currently, Tammie is located on 27 however within a week (after Dave moves 
 next week) she and Louise will be moving to 33.
 
 If you have any questions, please call me.
