This is great news, more from a market perception standpoint than an actual cash need. You can be assured that senior management is totally focused on the need to shore up the balance sheet with additional equity, now that we have the debt in place, but the equity we be a longer process.
 
 In the meantime, lets get back to work. I would encourage people to talk to their supervisors about this situation if you feel "angst".
