 The following change in policy to e-mail and voicemail has just come to our=
 =20
 attention.  This change in policy limits our exposure.  This type of exposu=
 re=20
 was discussed at this years management conference in San Antonio, listing=
 =20
 examples with Microsoft.  The largest impact of this change is your "sent=
 =20
 mail" retention being reduced to 30 days from the current 365 days.  You wi=
 ll=20
 note that if you move your sent mail to a folder it will be retained for an=
 =20
 entire year which should minimize this impact.  The rationale for the=20
 continued longevity in folders is that if you physically move mail to a=20
 folder you are making a conscious decision to keep that document.
 
 If you have not dealt with folders please give me a call and I can assist y=
 ou=20
 on their creation and on moving the documents into them.  Unless I hear a=
 =20
 concern, this new policy will be implemented on Friday, December 15th.  Our=
 =20
 help desk will be sending a message to the entire team tomorrow to notify=
 =20
 them of this action.
