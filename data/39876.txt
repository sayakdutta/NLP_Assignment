 
 To ensure a smooth flow of bank resolutions to the necessary signatories, I 
 am requesting that Enron Treasury first route the bank resolutions to Angela 
 Davis (EWS Legal) to be initialed before being routed to John Lavorato or 
 Louise Kitchen.
 
 If you have any questions please call me at 3-6544.  Thank you for your 
 attention to this matter.
