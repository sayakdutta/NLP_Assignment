 differences.  I want only the orange M&M's removed from our dressing room and 
 he wants only the brown ones removed.
 
 
 
 
 
 

    
 
                                        
 The word on the street is that the Gillaspie Drum Fund is being converted
 into the Gillaspie Home Improvement Fund.  THIS IS SERIOUS.  We all need to
 do our part in brainwashing Eric into the "band is bigger than the house"
 mentality.  Please do your part.
 
 Thanks,
