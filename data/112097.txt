 You are right.  There is no need to make a change so we will just amend the 
 MAC language.

 I don't have a problem, but would like to know why the change for Goldman
 Group.  That is a defined term -- see Part 3.

 Luanne:
 Our credit person is fine with revising the MAC language to say taht a MAC
 would
 be triggered if either (1) an entity's Credit Support Provider's rating from
 S&P
 is below BBB- by S&P or Baa3 by Moody's or (2) if such Credit Support
 Provider
 fails to be rated by both S&P and Moody's.  Also, in Sections 4.5 and 4.6 of
 the
 ISDA Schedule we would like to change the reference to "Goldman Group" to
 "The
 Goldman Sachs Group, Inc."
 
 I will have Tana Jones draft an amendment and send it to you.  Call me if
 there
 are any problems with the above.
 
 Tana,
 Please draft an amendment for my review.
