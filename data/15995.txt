 Not good. John White has a similar view, i.e., Loretta doesn't have many 
 choices given that the Legislature hasn't executed.  John did say, however, 
 that if we can provide the legal analysis to support doing something other 
 than "suspend," Loretta is likely to be amenable.  Seems like it would be 
 useful to try to get the analysis, assuming that  there's legal analysis to 
 support an alternative to "suspend."  
 
 Hertzberg and I are trading calls.  Will report back as soon as I hear 
 anything.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 I spoke with Bill and gave him the background on the DA issue (Turn's
 core/noncore, the green portfolio, etc) and asked him about some
 possibilities - i.e. could Loretta delay action until after the
 Legislature acts on SB18, and/or AB 82, etc.
 He responded that Loretta likes the SB18 approach, which she sees as
 cheaper and cleaner.  But she also is very loyal to the state and
 believes the timing is dependent upon the Treasurer's assessment of the
 need.  Right now Angelides accepts counsel's view that DA has to be
 eliminated to market the bonds.  Loretta believes the only authority the
 Commission has is when to suspend DA, not whether to suspend it.
 Angelides is continuing to press her to eliminate it, but she had hoped
 the Legislature would take action to give the Commission some
 flexibility.  That hasn't happened.  Their view is that the language of
 AB 1x needs to be changed legislatively, since their authority is so
 limited.  He expects action in the near future, but doesn't know exactly
 when.
