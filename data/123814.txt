 Casey,
 
 Can you have someone follow up with Hai and Harry and see how all these reports are working?

 I think we really need to get someone to ensure that the option sensitivity report is working and working quickly. If we are going to be trading a lot of financial deals then this would be beneficial. I know Hai did a lot of testing on it but I thought there were still problems. Am I wrong?
