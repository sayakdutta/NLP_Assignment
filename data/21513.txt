 David, your message was probably intended for Susan R. Lewis (who I believe 
 has left the company).  Just an FYI for you to take her off your distribution 
 list (and me too)!!

 Please plan to attend a  reception and dinner for those Analysts and 
 Associates due to rotate in the near future who have made significant 
 contributions to  Enron North America.  The function will be hosted  by the 
 Office of the Chairman at Morton's Steak House located at 5000 Westheimer on 
 July 27, 2000.  The reception will start at 7:00pm with dinner to follow at 
 7:45pm.  Please RSVP to Ted Bland at ext. 3-5275 no later than close of 
 business Monday, July 24.  This will be an informal gathering to discuss the 
 progress of ENA and an open forum to interact with the management team on a 
 one on one basis.  See you on Thursday. 
 
  Mark, Dave and John
