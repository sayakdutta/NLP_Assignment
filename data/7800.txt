 today.  If so, I will be on the way to South America on Sunday evening.  If 
 Chris' associate has any recommendations, I would love to hear them.  
 Thanks.  --Sally 
 
 
 
 

    
 
 
 Our other sister says this e-mail will work.   Let me know if you get this
 by e-mailing me back!   By the way, if you need any tips for South America,
 one of the guys who works with Chris is from Brazil - and a bunch of them
 travel down there . . . cw
