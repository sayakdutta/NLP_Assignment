 Unless this is another company or they have changed their name subsequent to 
 the execution of the ISDA Master in 1998, we have an ISDA Master in place 
 with this counterparty and have a copy of their Articles of Incorporation in 
 the file, and there is no "Inc." at the end of this company's name.  If you 
 would like me to send you a company of the company's Articles of 
 Incorporation I will be happy to do so.
