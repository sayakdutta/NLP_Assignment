 Greetings:
 
 
 As many of you know, the IEP Board met last week and decided upon a new
 committee structure within IEP. The Public Affairs Committee was created to
 replace the Market Response Committee with Greg Blue appointed as the
 interim chairperson. We would like to move to establish this new committee
 as soon as possible and meet to discuss direction, specific upcoming issues,
 an overall plan, budget and structure for the year. We would like to start
 this process with a conference call on Monday March 5, 2001 at 3:00 p.m.
 Please see call in information below. (It is not necessary for any
 consultants to participate in the Monday call.)   This conference call will
 be followed by an in-person meeting here at IEP on Thursday March 8, 2001 at
 2:00 p.m.
 
 If you are interested in participating on this committee please signify that
 with an e-mail response to this message.
 
 For those planning on participating on the conference call we will send out
 the agenda on Monday.  During that conference call we will also set the
 agenda for the Thursday in person meeting. During the Thursday meeting we
 would also like to move to select a permanent chairperson.
 
 Thank you for your attention to this important matter and I look forward to
 continuing to work with each of you and make this new committee structure a
 success.
 I have set up a permanent Conference Call in number and Pass-code for the
 Public Affairs Committee that we will use every time we have a conference
 call.  We will begin using this call-in number on Monday.
 The call in number for Monday's 3:00 p.m. call is is:
    1-800-486-2460
 The Pass-code is:
 120895
 
 
 Thanks,
