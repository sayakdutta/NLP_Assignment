 If it would help to have move time to interview and find the right person for the EGS CIO position, I would be willing to run the organization as Steve tries to leave for his new position.  I do not have an interest in the position but know I am capable of handling the job on a temporary basis if it would help.   I do not want us to rush just to fill the position if you and Stan do not have a strong feeling for any of the current candidates.  I think we need a strong person to carry us forward and deal with Networks.   cvb
