 	October 1, at 10:00 a.m. for 30 minutes.  It is not the best time for everyone, but it
 	was the best way to get the most people and get the meeting ASAP.  We will leave
 	a person on the team to cover phones, plus the North end team is going to help
 	watch the phone for that 30 minutes.  Thanks. Lynn

 Sorry I missed the meeting yesterday.  The Internet virus kept me running yesterday and today.  Lynn is scheduling a time for you or Britt to review the arbitration decision with members of the Gas Logistics team that deal with Oneok

 At our meeting yesterday on the Bushton settlement proposal, Phil Lowry led an interesting discussion on the meaning of the ONEOK measurement agreement as interpreted by the arbitrators.  That discussion highlighted the fact that there are still some subtleties about the agreement that may need to be reinforced for those people who have dealings with ONEOK at Bushton.  I'd like to volunteer Britt or myself (whichever is available) to crash your next staff meeting and take a few minutes to discuss the agreement and make sure we are all on the same page.  Rick and Lynn were involved and can help outline scenarios and how they should be resolved.  Thanks--pls let me know when and where (and whether I need to bring donuts).  df
