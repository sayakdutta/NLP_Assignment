 
 Mr. Sutton,
 
 I'm emailing you on Greg Whalley's behalf.  Is it possible for Greg to join 
 you on the company plane on Sunday over to London for the Open House?    I 
 understand you have different plans on the return.   I can book him 
 commercial on the return.  No worries, if the answer is no, I'm holding 
 commercial flights both ways.
 
    Sunday, February 27


 
 Please advise.

 Assistant to Greg Whalley
