 Barry,
 
 FYI the California QF's are negotiating a settlement deal with Edison and the 
 state of California which would fix energy payments over five years.  
 Currently the energy payments are indexed to Socal Border because a majority 
 of the Edison QF's buy spot gas.  If this settlement happens, the QF's will 
 likely want to buy financial swaps.  The Edison gas-fired QF's represent 
 about 500MMCF/Day of gas.
