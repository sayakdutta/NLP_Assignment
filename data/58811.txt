 
 I'm glad things are moving forward.  I've talked with Dave briefly and will follow up with him again.

 As planned, I spoke with Jeff this morning.  It was a great call.  I am really excited about what is ahead.
  
 We discussed the "title" issue.  I don't have any problems.  We should go with what is the best way to enter the organization.  
  
 Jeff said he was going to touch base with Dave this morning to move the process forward.  I can't wait for my interviews and to join the team. 
  
 Thanks for all of your help.
  
 Kevin
