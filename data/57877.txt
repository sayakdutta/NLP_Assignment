 
 I am attaching several items that I hope you will find useful when you brief 
 Chambers:
 
 
 A background document (which is a bit dated, but still useful). This is an 
 internal document, so I would appreciate it if you would keep it confidential 
 (though you are free to use the content in your own messages or documents).
 A basic outline of solutions.
 A summary of the Governor's recent executive orders. (It's another internal 
 analysis.) I think these orders show a better understanding of the problems 
 and solutions than we have seen before.  As we discussed on the phone, our 
 biggest problem is inertia ... we don't have much time, many solutions have 
 long lead times, and the political wheels grind slowly.
 
 Jeff Dasovich: please forward any specifics on the demand buy down proposal 
 and anything else that you think might be helpful background for Laura.
