 All the deals it lists are with EPMI Short Term California, which is myself 
 or Jeff Richter; so I'm not sure how helpful it will be in determining which 
 desk or counterparty you have discrepancies with. While we're on the subject 
 of sharing files, though, I had spoken with the confirmation group in Houston 
 about the deal file you send them each day. They suggested I ask to be added 
 to the list so I can better assist their group in finding discrepancies in 
 EPMI-EES deals. If that's okay with you, I would appreciate receiving it.
 
 In the meantime, I'll copy you on the EES sale prices starting tomorrow.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate

 Kate,
 I am in the confirmation group with EES and try to tie out our confirmtions 
 with the EPMI list I receive from Kim Hundle (EPMI), on a weekly basis.  This 
 file would be great help with this process.  Is there any way you could send 
 this to me as well? This would help me determine who the problem is with.  I 
 would appreciate it.  
 Thanks 
 Judy D
