 
 Thanks.  Since you and Carol are handling Enron "equity" deals, I passed my 
 Raptor IV assignment on to Carol.

 Mary/Carol: please note points 2 and 3 below.
 
 Ron Baker: based on my discussions with Rex Rogers, if the existing Enron 
 shares are cancelled and new shares issued, ENA board authorization will be 
 required. Note that the next scheduled board meeting is in early April.
 
 Ron Astin/Terry Yates: FYI, discuss point 5 below.....

 Gentlemen,
 
 After talking with both Joel Ephross and Ron Baker this morning about the 
 Raptor restructuring, my understanding of the current plan is summarized 
 below.   Please let me know if I have mischaracterized the proposed 
 approach.  We have a couple concerns from a tax perspective that are also 
 discussed below.  
 
 1.) V&E is currently drafting documents to allow each Raptor structure to 
 look to the other structures in terms of credit capacity. 
 2.) The previously proposed assignment of the LDC swaps from Raptor II to 
 Raptor IV is off the table.  These swaps will now be terminated.
 3.) Either Raptor II or Raptor IV will be used to hedge the Mariner 
 investment ($360M) instead.  
 4.) The JEDI structure is expected to be unwound thus allowing 12M Enron 
 Corp. shares to come back to Enron Corp. and no longer be treated as issued 
 and outstanding for purposes of Enron's EPS calculation. 
 5.) The value of 12M new Enron Corp. shares would be used to capitalize 
 either Raptor II or Raptor IV (12M shares x $70 = approx. $840M).  
  a.) As consideration for the contribution of the shares, the receivable owed 
 by the lower tier LLC to the Enron member under the grid note would be 
 increased by the same amount.
     b.) The credit capacity of the subject Raptor structure would increase by 
 an amount equal to the discount on the shares caused by their restricted 
 nature.   ($840M x 35% to 45% = approx. $294M to $378M)   
  c.) Ryan has apparently suggested that the shares actually be transferred to 
 a trust and that the trust issue a forward contract on the shares to the 
 chosen Raptor structure.  We have some concerns about this approach from a 
 tax perspective.   I would like to better understand the benefits of using a 
 forward contract, who would own the beneficial interest in the trust, and 
 what follow-on transactions might be planned regarding the trust.
  d.) I am still confused about the characterization of the contribution of 
 the additional shares as utilizing the credit capacity of the Raptor 
 structure to which they are contributed.   I can understand why the shares 
 would not increase the credit capacity of the structure, but I am told that 
 the potential downside on the Enron stock would actually utilize the 
 structure's capacity.
