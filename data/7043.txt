 M:\Electric\Transmission		
 
  
    Cc:	Will, Lloyd; Bentley, Corry; Imai, Rika
  
 Dale,
 
 I checked the following directories you requested in our meeting today.  See my notes below:
 
 M:\Electric\Genco			All of the Genco files must stay with the estate
 M:\Electric\NERC Reports		Rika Imai will move over to UBS
 M:\Electric\Transmission		Rika Imai will move over to UBS
 M:\eServices\Genco			All of the Genco files must stay with the estate
 M:\Electric\MidMarket\Transmission Info 
 M:\Electric\MidMarket\Transmission Studies	
 
 The two tranmission folders in the MidMarkets directory are not ours.  We will not need them however, you may want to take a quick look to see if your organization will need the information.  
 
 Please let me know if you need me to check others for you.  
 
 Thanks. 
 
 Debra
