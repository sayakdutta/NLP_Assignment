 I'd like to fax you something that Edison sent in support of their argument that:
 
 1) by virture of the PX credit framework, DA customers contributed to Edison's undercollection, and,
 2) DA customers should therefore contribute to the recovery of the undercollection.
 
 Could I get your fax numbers?  Would like to get your comments once you've reviewed the argument.  Thanks.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
