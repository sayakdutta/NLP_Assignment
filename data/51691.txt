 I think I forwarded the message to you.
 Did we act on it?

 Vince,
 
 Rob and I would like to coordinate a meeting with one of your Research people 
 to review the Spread Option calculation from the Exotica options library.  
 We're pricing a spread option deal in NYC and have some questions related to 
 the formula, greeks, etc.  Please let me know who might be available to sit 
 with us for about 1/2 hour.  Thanks
 
 - Jim

 Attached are the Delta positions for the NYC Constellation deal.  If you have 
 any questions or would like to review the model, please call me.
 
 Thanks,
