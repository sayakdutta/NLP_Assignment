 technologies will work.  I prefer the quicker of the two......in the interest 
 of time ie steam

 Got a question:
 At the Amarillo round table, a salesman was doing a pitch on his "bugs" that 
 "eat oil"
 The EPA gurus there didn't have a complaint against this.....
 How do ya'll feel about this? Is this something we should look at doing? Or 
 should we continue to clean our burms as we normally do (ie: steam clean)
 Let me know
 Thanks
 Kay
