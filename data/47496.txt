 jurisdictions and see if you disagreed with any of my information.  I'll be 
 out the rest of the week, but maybe when I get back we can chat again on the 
 phone, and maybe pull Edmund in, because before Edmund got sick, we were 
 pretty much in agreement on how he was supposed to respond about Americas 
 countries and how I should respond about European countries.
