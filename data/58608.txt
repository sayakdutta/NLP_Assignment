 see the point of it.  Most people are not going to care about our industry's 
 problem; they are going to be interested in solutions.  We should be telling 
 them what the answer is -- eg forward prices are lower; there is an 
 opportunity to buy forward now and protect yourself from volatility; etc.  
 What do you think?

 Can you please review?  We'd like to send as an informational
 piece to our California customers.   Prices are up to $14 today
 and not expected to drop anytime soon.  We're using this letter
 and follow-up calls to try to curtail load.  I can explain further if
 needed.
