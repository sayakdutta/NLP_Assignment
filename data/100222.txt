 Jim,
 I wanted to clarify that we will still be pulling gas out of the ground in Febr & March.  The Stg Book has always recorded hedgable volumes of 56.5 BCF.   This is the difference between 117.5 BCF and 61 BCF.  The Acctg Books have always recorded the working gas as everything above I believe 70 BCF.  So when David says working gas will be -0- by January 31, 2001 he is correct but we will be drawing down on what the Acctg Books have recorded as Cushion Gas.

 According to the Cost of Inventory Schedule there will be no Working Gas in the ground at the end of January.  That is assuming we have actually withdrawn what we have booked.
