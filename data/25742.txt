 All,
 
 For those of you who have not responded to the prior parking email, please 
 take a moment in doing do, as I am trying to get a firmed up number for 

 of the garage that you are currently parking in.  This would include those of 
 you that ride the bus, participate in the vanpool or park on a surface lot. 
 Thank you in advance for your cooperation.  
 
 Regards,
