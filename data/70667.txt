 
 Opps. Sorry about the confusion.  We are selling the equity in CA to Coral, 
 so I call it by that name.  I'm looking for a list of what you need as 
 referencedin the last line of this email.
 
 Hope that helps,
 
 Kay
 
 
 
 

   
  
 
 Kay,
    Attached are the latest versions of the CA Energy Development
 breakout agreements.  Please note that, because the agreements deal with
 only one Unit each, the term "Unit Liability Amount" has been replaced
 with "Maximum Liability Amount."  Also, there is no need for an Exhbit
 N-1, so that reference has been deleted as well.  The agreement is still
 missing an Agreement Reference number, Ben Jacoby's fax number, and the
 information needed for the exhibits.  Thanks, Chris
