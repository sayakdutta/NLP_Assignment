 Rockhounds & parents,
 ?
 Hey everyone, I've finally got the pre-season game  schedule.? I've attached 
 the latest overall schedule (rev 2,?and in a  earlier version of Excell so 
 hopefully it can be easily opened).? Please  let me know if this is a format 
 problem for anyone, I can fax it and/or mail it  if you'll let me know.
 ?
 Basically the changes are that our games next week are  Tuesday (6:00 pm 
 gametime?at Memorial Middle School field #3) and  Thursday (8:00 pm gametime 
 at Spring Forest Field #2, our  regular practice field)? Also, I've upped the 
 practice start time  next Saturday to 8:30 am going?till 10:30 (since our  
 game?Tuesday the 6th will?wipe out our practice)?and corrected  the error on 
 the time for the March 10th practice (thanks Trisha).? If  these games are 
 rained out they will not be made up.
 ?
 By the way, I've got a practice scheduled for the March 10th  but I'm sure 
 some will be out since that's the first part of SBISD spring  break.? Please 
 let me know how many will be able to attend.
 ?
 I don't think this really applies to anyone on our team, by  just fyi:? the 
 league has requested that parents not drop their kids off in  front of the 
 fields (by driving down the dirt trail).? There is too much  kid traffic and 
 they're worried about accidents.? Just keep to the parking  lot.
 ?
 See everyone this Tuesday at 7:30.
 ?
 thanks,
 Jeff
