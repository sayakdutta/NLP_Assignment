 current version and specifically any credit revisions that are necessary.  
 The old master was only set up for 6 month or less term deals with volumes of 
 15,000 MMBtu or less.

 Gerald,
 Russell informed me that we are amending the current Master Physical that we 
 have with them. Since I am just being informed of any changes, I would like 
 to know the purpose for the ammendment.
