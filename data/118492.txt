 Here is my itinerary for Christmas travel:
 
 Friday 12/24    Continental 4126  Leaves Houston 7:55 am  Arrives Cincinnati 
 11:20 am
 Sunday 12/26  Continentat 4122  Leaves Cincinnati 5:45 pm  Arrives Houston 
 7:25 pm
 
 These are Continental Express flights - I don't know if that makes a 
 difference in terminals in Cincinnati or not - it does in Houston.
