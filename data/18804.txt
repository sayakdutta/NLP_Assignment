 
 Hi:  I was surprised to see you at the I-House last nite.  Haven't seen you 
 for a while.  Was going to drop by and say hi and catch up but your table was 
 extremely popular and I didn't want to intrude.  This is the first 
 travel-free week I've had in a long time.  You want to try to have lunch?  Or 
 we could meet at a non-I-House place during the break and catch up if you 
 like.  Dying to hear about Montana and your possible new life as a day 
 student.  Did you manage to get away last Thursday?
 
 Best,
 Jeff
