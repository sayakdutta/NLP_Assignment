 
 I am OK with the matrix.  Please also note that any GTC with a term of 9 months or longer should be signed by Enron and Counterparties.  
 
 Nelson,  are you OK with using a GTC Spot for one-day deals?
 
  
     
 see below is the template.

 Lisa,
 
 This is the matrix I got from Judy Thorne on which GTCs to use.  Can you please double-check it and see if anything has changed?
 
 Based on this, one-day deals will fall under a GTC Spot if we don't have a GISB in place with the producer.  In that instance, we don't need special handling in Sitara.
 
 Hope this helps.  Please let me know what you find out from Gerald.
 
 Thanks,

 Gerald,
 
 When you get a second, see if the following accurately captures which confirmation template should be used with which deals.
 
 Confirmation Usage		
 		
 Form	Deal Type	
 GTC Firm Pooled Gas	1 - 12 months Pooled Gas	
 GTC Firm Point Gas	1 - 5 months Wellhead Gas	
 Committed Reserves	Producer trades > 6 months	
 GISB	Day-month trades not with Producers with GISB	
 GTC Spot	Day-month trades not with Producers without GISB	
 
 Thanks,
 Judy
