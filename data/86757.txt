 the phone.
 
 Thanks,

 Susan, 
 On your voice mail you said that the Gas Daily term was October 2000 and the 
 Inside Ferc term was November 30, 2000 through February 28, 2001.  Should it 
 be Nov 1st instead?

 Stevens-
 
 I've called Stacy Dickson and provided the term changes for the confirmation.
 
 Thanks,

 Susan,
 
 As we discussed this morning, we would like to change the term of the above
 contract to October through February 2001, with the year extension.  Also,
 change the October pricing to the "Gas Daily".
 
 Thank you for your patience.
 
 Stevens
