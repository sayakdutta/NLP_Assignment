 Can someone do a study on the tariffs of major pipeline storage fields to determine which fields require that storage gas is withdrawn regardless of price.  If not, how much to roll storage?
 
  
     
 I was looking at past levels, and I thouhgt to share my findings with you.
 

 
 Also, 1999 had the highest levels for the third week of January, levels were 2,039.  Year 2002 is 255 bcf ahead.
