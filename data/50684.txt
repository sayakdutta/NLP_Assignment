 Vince,
 It was good seeing you again today.  I want to make sure the NFCF is on
 your calendar for May 4-5.   You should be receiving some registration
 materials shortly.
 
 Please plan on coming if you can.
 Also, please attend the dinner on Friday evening along with your wife if
 possible.
 
 Regards,
 Dave
