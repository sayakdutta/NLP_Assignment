 
 Attached are the latest changes to the docs redlined against the originals 
 docs, per your voicemail.
 
 Chris,  I made one slight change from the versions I had sent to you 
 earlier.  In the Capacity Allocation agreement signature block, I am now 
 having ENA sign for section 4.5 as well. 
 
  Let me know if you need anything else.
