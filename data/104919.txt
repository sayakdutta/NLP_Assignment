 
 Attached are the latest documents from the ECT power trading group.  The 
 documents distributed in March, 1999 were revised recently although no 
 redline is available.  There are no other forms currently in use.  I'll speak 
 with Elizabeth Sager about pending revisions.  Also, I will send to you both 
 my thoughts regarding an action plan for the coming months.  Let me know if 
 you need anything further and if I should be copying any business 
 people/legal on our e-mails.  Sara
