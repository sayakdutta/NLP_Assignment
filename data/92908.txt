 
 Hey,
 
 Several of us are going to lunch today.  It's kind of a combination birthday 
 party and going away party for Crystal.  Oops I shouldn't have told you she's 
 coming...just kidding.  You're invited if you want to come.  But I understand 
 if you are too busy today to take a long lunch.  Let me know if you want to 
 come.
