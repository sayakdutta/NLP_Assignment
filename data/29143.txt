 ahead and draft something up and we can talk soon.  Thanks.  DF
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
   
  
 Drew - I visited with the Senate sponsor (it is now officially SB159) in New 
 Mexico and he would probably like to have some comments from Enron at the 
 hearing, whenever that is (nothing set yet).  I think that you or Mary Kay 
 (since Mike will likely be gone) would be the appropriate officer to 
 testify.  I will try and draft some comments since there may be little notice 
 for the hearing.  If you disagree, please let me know.
 
 On another matter I asked Rob to find out who Tri-States Gov't Affairs person 
 was and it turns out he is an old friend of mine (Dave Mazour) from my water 
 resources days.  I spoke to him today and he was pleased to hear of our 
 efforts to help.  He also reiterated that his Board is adament they will not 
 be regulated by the PRC and will walk from the deal.  I'm sure I will have 
 more conversations with him.
 
 I appreciated your taking time to call Carpenter.  All of this helps our 
 cause.
