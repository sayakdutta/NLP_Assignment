 
 Jim,
 
 What about 2 p.m., my time, on Friday, August 17. If this works for you,
 I shall try to invite a lawyer who wrote the draft of the non-disclosure agreement.

 Vince,
 
 When would be a good time for us to call you?  We would like to talk
 about the agenda for your visit and the NDA you sent us.
