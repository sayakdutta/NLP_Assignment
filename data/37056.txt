 Hello,
 It sounds like you got hooked up with Sean.  I went to Dallas on Friday
 and just got your message.  How was Colorado?

 Hey,
 
 How goes it?  I need your brother's phone numbers.  I am staying with
 him
 tomorrow night, but don't have directions.  We have only been
 communicating
 via email.  I hope you get this today.  Thanks.
