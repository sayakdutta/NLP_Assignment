 Thank you for your invitation to Mr. Skilling to speak at the March 22, 2000, 
 Energy Industry Restructuring seminar in Paris.  Unfortunately, Mr. 
 Skilling's schedule does not allow him to participate.
 
 Sincerely,

 Jeff,
 
 The International Energy Agency would like to invite you to speak at a
 one-day Seminar on Energy Industry Restructuring to be held on 22 March 2000
 here in Paris.  Enron's unique position in the global gas and electricity
 businesses and your personal role in bringing that about would be of great
 interest to the audience.
 
 The audience will be composed of senior government officials from IEA member
 countries who serve as delegates to three of our "Standing Groups" (i.e.,
 oversight committees); the Standing Group on the Oil Market, the Standing
 Group on Emergency Questions and the Standing Group on the Long-Term.
 Chatham House rules will apply (no attribution without permission, no press,
 open exchange of ideas).
 
 If your schedule and inclination permits, we would like you to speak for
 about 25-35 minutes on corporate objectives and strategies, your experiences
 to date and any general plans for the future (that you are permitted to
 discuss), with a focus on the gas and electric industries.  Case studies of
 particular business developments would be of special interest.
 
 The presentation would be in the second panel of the morning on "Sectoral
 Aspects of Energy M&A Activities from a Company Perspective".  The 2-hour
 session would start  at around 11AM and would include two other speakers
 from Europe covering oil; Michel de Fabiani (President of BP France and
 chief architect of the BP-Mobl downstream joint venture), who has
 tentatively accepted and electricity; M. Saab, Head of Planning for EdF, who
 has been invited, but is checking his schedule.
 
 We are attempting to line up senior officials from the FTC, the EU
 Competition Authority and a Japanese energy industry authority for an early
 afternoon session to discuss "Public Policy Implications of Energy M&A
 Activity".  You might find some useful insights into the possibly disparate
 regulatory mentalities in these three regions.
 
 I would be pleased to send you a complete working agenda for the meeting and
 a formal invitation letter.
 
 Please give my best regards to Ken Lay.
 
 David
 
 P.S. You may remember me from the days I was running the Energy Group and
 Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in the 1980s, and for part of the time
 following Enron.  I am now Head of the Oil Industry and Markets Division at
 IEA and Editor of the IEA Monthly Oil Market Report.  I hope your schedule
 will allow you to come to Paris.
