 You sent me a note yesterday asking what has happened to the Robert Burns 
 matter (the $11 million invoice).  I have talked to Mr. Burns' lawyer and 
 told him -- in essence -- that he is crazy and that we don't intend to pay 
 his client a dime.  We'll just have to sit back and wait and see if a lawsuit 
 is filed.
