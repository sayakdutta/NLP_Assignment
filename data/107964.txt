 My view on the discussions with Southern Co. is that it is one of several 
 potential ways to get at some upside out of our rights at Elba Island.  It's 
 also giving us a good indication of where the market is for gas sourced from 
 LNG coming in to Elba.  Nothing will be committed to without considering all 
 the alternatives at Elba and a full review within EGM and asumably ENA.  The 
 discussions are still, in my view, exploratory.
 
 Thanks
 
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 


  
  
 Before we sign ANYTHING with Southern about the Elba volumes, I'd like an 
 update.  Also I want to make sure we aren't trading anything away at Elba 
 that we could be talking about elsewhere.  Thanks.
