 SARA,
 Notes below.  Gary is going to an offsite meeting with JP Morgan next week 
 and has requested that he would like this in place when he goes.  
 Many thanks. Sheila

 Sheila:
 
 Just a few questions about this futures agreement:
 
 (1)  Is it OK for JP to combine our orders with orders of other clients and 
 JP's affiliates? YES
 (2)  Is it OK (after we deposit property into our account) for JP to return 
 "property of like or equivalent kind or amount"? NO
 (3)  Do you want to agree to an interest rate (on customer funds) upfront or 
 only "as agreed from time to time"? I WOULD LIKE TO AGREE TO AN INTEREST RATE 
 UPFRONT. (EG. FED FUNDS). CAN WE TAKE A LOOK AT PRU, CARR AND CSFB futures 
 agreements TO SEE WHAT IS MARKET?
