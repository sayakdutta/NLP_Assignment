 
 Jana,
 
 Friday, July 28th works for us. We can work out details
 closer to the 28th.  If you take  Hardy Toll Road, you will need about 40-45 
 minutes
 to get to the Woodlands on Friday after 6:00 p.m. I shall send you detailed 
 directions
 later.
 
 Look forward to seeing you again.

 Vince,
 Sorry it has taken me awhile to get back to you.  We were trying to sort out
 our plans.
 
 How does Friday, July 28 look?  Does it take about an  hour to get up there?
 
 thanks
 
 Jana
