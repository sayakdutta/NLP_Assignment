 This is HTA...not USTA...so a rating isn't necessary.  So there is nothing to
 worry about.  USTA is played in the summer, so you won't have to worry about
 having a rating until next year.  Usually, if you play any USTA tournaments,
 you will automatically get a rating the following year.  If you're
 interested, you should try playing a tournament this year.  Unless you really
 try to sand bag your level, they don't care about a rating.
