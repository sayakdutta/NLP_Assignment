 Drew - Just wanted to follow up on our discussion on Monday about new 
 services, especially hourly firm.   As we discussed
 our team does not see a need to create or offer this service at this time.   
 However, we did not get a chance to discuss the merits of going forward 
 anyway to act on the receptivity of FERC to these services.   Please give me 
 a call or let me know when we can stop by to discuss briefly.  I would like 
 Tim to participate in the discussion as well.  He is out today meeting w/
 GRE and will be back on Friday.
 
 Thanks.  John 
 
 PS - I could give you a quick update on Hubbard at that time also.
