 
 We definately need to talk ASAP.  Please call Cindy or call me at home 281.320.1240.  With regard to 1) and 2) the answer for now is no for now.  Between Rod and Tod we will keep you covered.  You will have to work double load for a while longer with regard to Americas-GM.  The O&M makes sence.  Go ahead.  I will explain all this when I talk with you.

 Following up on our lunch meeting in Houston, there are 3 positions which I want to fill, preferably by the end of the year:
 	
 	1.  CFO.  With Tod's part-time status as of Jan 1, we will need a CFO.  That person can sit either in Texas or California.  
 
 	2.  Americas - GM. I want to fill the Americas VP/General Manager position.  This person will have overall P&L responsibility for our Americas business unit and will manage our US commercial, engineering, manufacturing and O&M activities.  This is a critical day-to-day operating position and I am certainly not giving it the needed attention.  This person needs to sit in California and spend a significant amount of his or her time in Tehachapi.  I really do not have an internal candidate whom I would be comfortable placing in this role and view this as an opportunity to further upgrade our senior management ranks.  I want to find a superstar to fill this role! 
 
 	3.  Americas - O&M.  I need to add a senior O&M person in the US (a #2 who can mature into #1).  We are recruiting for this position externally, but if you know of any good candidates who might be interested, that would be great. 
 
  I will set up a time to talk with you about all three positions  - clearly, if there are qualified Enron candidates that are looking for a home/new challenge, I would be very interested.  Adam
