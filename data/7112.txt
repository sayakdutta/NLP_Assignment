At that time, KCPL will no longer be a member of MAPP. KCPL will maintain its membership in SPP as a Transmission Owner under the SPP OATT. This requires a modification of how reservations under the SPP OATT should be made and how associated schedules should be submitted. Only reservations with a POR/POD of KCPL are at issue. SPP wants to take this opportunity to inform our customers of the associated changes. Please see the attached document, which has also been posted on the SPP OASIS page, on how reservations will be treated.
