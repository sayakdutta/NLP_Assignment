 This is what we currently have.  The Q3 analyst report may have a few additional slides, and updates.  I'll take a look when it's posted.  When you decide which slides you want to use, Katrina can put together cover and transition pages, and make sure the formatting (titles, footers, etc.) is consistent (thanks Katrina).
