 
 Mark,
 
 Mieco is the cpy where we had the misposted/bad online trade & we held up 
 their master.  Can we send it out?

 It has been brought to my attention that the Mieco ISDA has not been received 
 by the company.  Could you let me know if there is any hold up or perhaps if 
 we need to trace the package?      Thanks

 Ed,
 I thought Mary and I finalized our issues a week or so ago, but I haven't
 seen anything yet.  Maybe getting a signature?  Peter
 
 
     
 
 
 Peter,
 
 Hope all is well.  Wanted to make sure that the ISDA has been received by
 you.  My last recollection was that Mary Cook had agreed to all of your
 requests.  Please respond when you get a chance.
 
 Regards,
 
 Ed Sacks
