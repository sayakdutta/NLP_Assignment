 I think this warrants some investigation

 Hi Savita,
 
 Jennifer and I have been looking through the ICE volumes on physical gas and it looks like nearly  all of their really huge Nat Gas volumes are being done on firm, physical, CUSTOM trades. It's probably a good bet that these "custom" products are some sort of structured or one-off deals that are not available to the general trading public on their website, but are instead closed, large-scale transactions done between the various ICE entities as a means of pumping up their volumes.
 
 I've gone through the attached spreadsheet and highlighted several examples of these "custom" deals and have spoken with Bob Shults to see if he has any contacts at ICE that might be able to shed light on exactly what these things are. He hasn't called anyone yet, however, and I've asked him not to until you and Andy have had a chance to go over this. 
 
 Could be something, could be nothing...

 There are 2 sheets in the following attachment that contain Enron transactional data for the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and Dynegy Direct, labeled as follows:
 "Enron Activity - Dynegy Direct"
 "Enron Activity - ICE"
 
  
 
 Note: Total activity for Dynegy Direct is not available, therefore Enron's Percentage can not be calculated.
 
 Let me know if you have any questions or comments.
