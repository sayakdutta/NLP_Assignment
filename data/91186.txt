 
 thanks for checking on that , it was $120 for the club , how should i put it on my next exp report ?
 
 
  
     
 I called and spoke with the manager over accounting.  He said that the reason your expense report took so long is that it was being audited.  They do this randomly.  I told him you need a check cut today on the 107.45 and he said the other expense report should be in your account by this Friday.  I can still add the cash expense.  Just tell me how much it was.  You do not need a receipt if it was under $75.  
 
 Let me know.
 
 Sorry for the inconvenience.
