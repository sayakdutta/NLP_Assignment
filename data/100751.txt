 think an all girls gift exchange would be really fun but, as you guys well 
 know, I'm up for anything.  As for restaurants, I just tried this new place 
 called Bossa's and it was really good.  It's right across from the Rice Hotel 
 downtown and has a neat atmosphere.  Of course there are also all kinds of 
 places around our "area of town" that would be great as well...PF Chang's, Mi 
 Luna, Americas, La Griglia (sp?), etc. etc.  Just let me know the time and 
 place.
 
 Thanks again Lisa for organizing all of this, you're the greatest.

 PS- If any one has an urge to grab a bite to eat or coffee either tonight or 
 tomorrow night let me know.  I feel like I haven't seen you guys in forever.
