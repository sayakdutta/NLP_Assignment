 
 This E-mail is about a couple of issues I thought we might start coordinating 
 on.
 
 As I mentioned to you this morning Paul, I thought you should be aware that 
 Craig Gannett is planning to attend the NW governor's roundtable (that you 
 will be attending) to monitor it for Cynthia.  I just found this out 
 yesterday.  I will not be attending.  
 
 In addition, here's a version of a paper Craig Gannett is working on 
 recommending changes to help solve the energy crisis for the NW.  Craig has 
 been working on this with Cynthia Sanderr and I believe has circulated this 
 paper in draft form to some degree on the Hill.  I have not given Craig any 
 comments on the paper as yet.
