 > RISK CONSIDERATIONS FOR ENRON COUNTERPARTIES:
 > FAILURE TO EXERCISE RIGHTS MAY CONSTITUTE WAIVER
 >
 >
 >       The reduction by Moody's Investor Service Inc. of Enron Corp.'s
 > senior unsecured long-term debt to Baa2 from Baa1 this week may be an
 > issue of concern for companies that are counterparts to Enron obligations.
 > This downgrade may have immediate consequences under existing transactions
 > with Enron given that its current credit rating is now two levels above
 > non-investment grade.  Any further downgrade into non-investment grade
 > levels could seriously affect relationships between counterparties and
 > Enron, and possibly Enron counterparties and their counterparties.
 >
 >       Enron is the principal in nearly one-quarter of all electricity and
 > natural gas trades in the United States.  For Enron's power and gas
 > trading counterparties, a credit event such as a downgrade by Moody's may
 > precipitate certain obligations under the terms of their trading
 > transactions.  For example, any downgrade, not just a downgrade resulting
 > in a sub-investment grade rating, may entitle a counterparty to require
 > Enron to provide additional credit in support of Enron's purchase
 > obligations.  Counterparties should examine all power, gas or other
 > commodity purchase and sale documentation to confirm whether they possess
 > this right.  The failure to exercise this right may constitute a waiver
 > and foreclose access to critical performance and payment assurance,
 > threatening to alter the risk assessment and mitigation considerations
 > upon which the transactions were originally based.  Furthermore, a failure
 > to declare a credit event or default against Enron could cause a default
 > on the part of the counterparty itself in collateral or ancillary
 > arrangements, such as its financing.  The potential for a domino effect,
 > causing defaults or credit events in a series of transactions, is
 > considerable.
 >
 >       It is uncertain whether Enron's efforts to obtain new lines of
 > credit will be sufficient to overcome the current difficulties.
 > Regardless, it is prudent to review the terms of existing transactions
 > with Enron or its affiliates, including any guarantees or other forms of
 > corporate credit support.  It is also advisable to examine the terms of
 > transactions dependent on, or otherwise ancillary to, transactions with
 > Enron or its affiliates to avoid any consequential effects of the Enron
 > credit ratings downgrade.
