 
 Kevin,
 
 I would like to see the expense reports to monitor
 the rate at which we approach our group budget limits.
 
 Thanks.
 
 Vince

 Hello Everyone ,
 
 Starting Today , 2/22/00  Mike Roberts signed a expense report.
 
 Vince, I need to know from you if this is okay and do you want to see
 them ?
 
 Also Shirley , if Mike signs for anything else other than a expense report ,
  I will pass it by your desk whereby you can know exactly what it is.
 
                             
                                         Thanks
                                      Kevin Moore
 Please inform........
