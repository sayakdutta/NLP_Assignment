 
 that bid won't be there next week :(
 
 
 
 

    
 
 I am going to play with Taylor one week.  I have been waiting this long.  I
 know I am blowing a real good deal, but I will come to you next week, after
 I see what he can do.

 have you decided?  I am not trying to rush you - but I am leaving early
 today for Austin - so I need to set my lineup before I leave!
 
 Let me know

 That sounds viable.  Give me a little time to mull it over.  I commend you

 walls, toomer, and garner for taylor?  that is the best i can do and that
 is the best deal you will get for taylor all year regardless of how he
 does.
 
 now i would be willing to talk freeman if you want to thro in either
 watters, anderson or george?
 
 I need to know fairly quickly

 I am happy with my Tight End and Garner has proven less valuable than
 Watters thus far this season.

 gonzalez for taylor and watters?

 Eric,
 
 Let me know if I have Anderson or not.  If I have Morton I want to pick him
 up and drop my other kicker.  If I don't have Morton do the same thing
 except pick Hanson up instead of Anderson
