 
 David,
 
 Howdy.  Thanks for the email.  I agree he is a very sharp guy and does a 
 great job.
 
 I will be attending the Masters again this year.  I will be on our 2nd trip 
 which is Wed - Friday.  We do normally have a very full agenda but if you'll 
 leave me your information, I'll try to stop and say hello.
 
 Thanks,
 Mike
