 
 I don't plan to attend the NNG customer accts meeting
 
  
     
 Should I free up this time on your calendar?
 
 Thanks, Ricki
 
  
     
 I moved this meeting date to avoid potential conflicts with people being out the office on Good Friday.  Dynegy will be represented in this meeting so please come prepared to explain any issues or variances.
