 the Virgin Islands!  Is it a Survivor gig?

 We missed you too.  Everybody is kind of worried about you....and hoping that 
 you're holding out o.k..  Barbara wasn't able to make it and Marchris was 
 hanging out with Governor Jeb, so we had a smaller group.  I just got back to 
 Mpls and am heading off to the Virgin Islands on Saturday.

 Just wanted to send a note to say that I'm very sorry that I couldn't make it 
 to the meeting, miss catching up with folks, and hope that all's going well.  
 Hope to see you very soon.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
