If it is a simple a a name change or some mergers, maybe.  Is this?  If it's not, we may have to assign the trades over.  I know I've got a financial master with BP Exploration & Oil Inc.  I just can't move the profile.
 
 What's the scoop here?  I have no records of a name change/merger here, do you?
