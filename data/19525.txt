 
 An SVP from Edison just informed us that Edison will be sending out by email information on DASR acceptance/rejection.
 He said that all DASRs submitted prior to midnight on 9.20.01 will be accepted, irrespective of whether Edison subsequently rejected them for inadequate information, adminstrative or other reasons.
 He said that they will also be asking ESPs to provided a list of all contracts executed prior to midnight 9.20.01 and for which DASRs have not yet been submitted.
 When the DASRs for those contracts are submitted, he said that Edison will accept them, so long as they track the list previously submitted.
 I asked if Edison would be lobbying to have the Commission issue a subsequent decision clawing the suspension date back to July 1.
 He said he didn't believe they intended to do that, but he said that they did intend to lobby the Commission to make sure that newly-minted DA customers don't escape any costs they're responsible for.
 
 Please forward this along to anyone else who might need the information.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
