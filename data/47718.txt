 so there is no need to send us a copy of the notice.

 So long as there is a copy of the notice in the appropriate files then I do 
 not need to see it.  I would suggest sending a copy to Tana Jones in the 
 financial trading group in the event there is a financial trading master.
 
 Thanks, 
 
 Jeff

 Jeff,
 
 I recieved a notification from CMS Field Services, Inc. indicating that 
 effective 5/15/01 they will begin recording purchase, sale and derivative 
 transactions for natural gas between our companies.  I have sent a copy to 
 the fileroom, should I forward a copy to you also?  I spoke with one of the 
 Adminative Assistants on the Trading floor and they thought that I should 
 contact Legal.  Please advise.
 
 Regards,
