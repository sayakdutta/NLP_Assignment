   Attached please find a copy of the press release that was posted this
 morning.  We have been working on this opportunity for some number of
 months and are delighted to share the good news with you.  We feel that
 Mayor Day's business law and litigation talent complements A&K's to
 create a true Houston powerhouse to better serve your needs.  I intend
 to spend as much time as I can in the next few weeks to see you in
 person and answer any questions you may have and to introduce you to the
 fine Mayor Day lawyers we are bringing on board.  In the meantime,
 please feel free to call me 713.220.4161.  We very much value our
 relationship with the Enron Legal Department and look forward to
 continuing to maintain and expand the work we do with you!
