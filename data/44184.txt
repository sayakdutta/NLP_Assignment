 
 If the deal is to be a fixed volume, I would prefer to use the Enfolio Master 
 Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement and document the deal thereunder.  Please let me 
 know.
 
 Russell, Have you sent me a credit sheet on this?

 John!
 


 However we would like to have this done under a contract. 
 
 Dan, we want to know whether we should do this under a "Master Purchase" or a 
 "Master Purchase, Sale".  
 
 
 Thanks
 Rudwell.
