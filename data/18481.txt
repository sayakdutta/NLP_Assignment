 will have to get somewhat friendlier to business (and our poor economy). 
 
 Best,

 Apparently it didn't go very well.  Burton said he didn't have to deal with 
 Reps. cause he
 controls a 2/3 vote in his house.  Brulte called Rep leadership together in 
 his office last
 night to discuss their next move.  This is just the beginning of the dance, 
 however.  I'll
 let you know.
 
 Also, Zaremberg said he got a call from a reporter who told him the PUC 
 decision today would
 be friendlier to business.  You probably know that and more, but I'm passing 
 it on.
 Zaremberg is also going to work on Burton and his blind faith in consumer 
 strategies.
