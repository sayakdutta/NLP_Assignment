 Gentlemen,
 
 The following are links that have a map and a bracket for the tournament. 
 Our first game is at 8:30 AM on Sunday. We have already lost Darren for the 
 whole tournament and Gosset for at least the first game. 
 Everyone must be there on TIME. That means that you must be at the fields no 
 later than 8 AM! We now only have 10 guys for the first game!!!!!!!
 
 If you can't make it at 8 AM, tell me know so we can replace you!!!!! 
 EVERYONE e-mail me and let me know that you will be there by 8 AM! Gosset 
 will fire you if you screw the team!!!!
