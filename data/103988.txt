 Hi, Edmund!  Please identify the ENTIRE Morgan name, please.  We are 
 negotiating with several of their entities.  Which type of trading?  Thanks.

 I've spoken with Morgan Stanley this afternoon to get details on progress 
 with the ISDA for credit trading.
 
 In brief, they have our ISDA documents and are in the process of reviewing 
 them.  They also informed me that Enron North America was in the process of 
 negotiating ISDA documents with the same MS entity.  They are going to 
 provide consolidated comments to myself and Sara Shackleton in Houston during 
 the course of tomorrow.
 
 I'll liaise with Sara to ensure that this gets pushed along at top speed from 
 the Enron end.
 
 Thanks, Edmund
