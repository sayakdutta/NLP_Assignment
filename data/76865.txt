 right about not going to a MEGA university.

 Hey. I just had a "Thank goodness I go to Southwestern" moment. I was
 walking to get help from my professor for my test tomorrow (we ended up in
 there for an hour and a half!), and I saw Dr. Parks, a business professor I
 have had but do not have right now. He told me that he got a compliment on
 me and my tour Friday by one of the prospective students' grandparent's.
 Then I was walking upstairs, and I saw a professor I have not had a class
 with since FRESHMAN year. She asked how I was, etc... And I told her I was
 going to Dr. Early's office for help on Money and Banking. She asked how
 the class was going, and I told her it's a ton of work, but it's do-able.
 Then she said it's do-able for you, of course. You were always so good (or
 something like that). I had her for SOCIOLOGY (not for my major or minor or
 anything). So, I just got complimented nicely by two professors that I
 don't even have a class with this semester, and then I got outside help for
 an hour and a half. Yikes is this place ever awesome! I just thought I
 would share.:)
 
 Love,
 PMR
