 
 Happy Birthday!
 Sounds like a fun time.
 I have a dentist appt out by the house at 4:00 pm so I will have to opt for dinner next week!
 Hope you have a fun night celebrating your ah? 28 birthday, right?
 Call when you figure out what's good for you.  Wednesday looks best for me right now.

 Hey !  What has been going on ?  We never did make it to dinner.  
 I booked a last minute trip to the Islands two weeks ago and ran into Legler at the airport -- they were headed to France and their gate was 
 next to ours.  
 Anyways, if you get a chance - I thought the below would be a good way to see you and catch up or even get to see some of the old gang.
 Hope you can make it - and if not, let's do dinner sometime next week ?
