 I believe this is the most current version which should form the basis of the 
 Salmon LLC contract (formerly known as LV Co Gen facility agreement).

 Bill/Dale/Kay-
 
 I've made redline edits with regards to LVCII performance guarantee values
 in Section 10.7 for output and heat rate based on the Feb 8, 2001 guarantee
 sheet.
 
 Dale, please send revised LVC II facility agreement to reflect Units 25-28
 with appropriate schedules for price, delivery, payment and termination
 schedules at your earliest convenience.
 
 The units 19-20 and 23-24 that are currently reflected in this document will
 be left in E-Next (Turbopark).  The schedules for price, delivery, payment
 will remain the same for these units.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Lee

 Bill Williams asked me to forward the attached execution form of the
 LM-6000 purchase contract.
 
 The second attachment is to be inserted as Exhibit H-2 in the contract.  I
 understand that we received it from GE, and that it is available only in
 pdf format.
 
 Thanks.
