 Today I gave a presentation to the originators and traders in Gary 
 Hickerson's ag group, including a proposal of control procedures for 
 compliance with ag option restrictions.  Gary was not present, but the 
 procedures were well received by the group, who felt that they were practical 
 and could be complied with.
 
 Attached is an outline of the presentation, including the proposed 
 procedures.  -- Bob
