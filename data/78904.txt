 Tom, I am going to go to a Fire Warden Class today from 1:30 - 4:30 to become a Fire Warden for the new building.  Is there anything you need me to do before I go to help you get packed up ... especially since you're working a half day tomorrow?
 
  
     
 Yes it is okay
 
  
     
 I can't remember if you replied or not, but is it okay for me to go to this class tomorrow?  Do you think that Jessica will be back?
 
  
     
 Ina, I would like to take the Fire Warden Class on Thurs, Nov 15th from 1:30 - 4:30 pm.  Please let me know if there is enough coverage on the phones so that I can go.
 
 thanks,
 Laura
