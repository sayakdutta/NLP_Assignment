 
 Kali Pereira was not able to make the lesson on Sunday the 21st due to car 
 trouble.  By my calculations, she has taken 3 private lessons since and 
 including Dec 31, leaving an $89 balance of the $170.  That would allow for 3 
 additional private lessons.  What days and times will work over the next few 
 weeks?  Saturdays and Sundays will work depending on the time.  After school 
 during the week might work, with the exception of Mondays.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Susan Pereira
