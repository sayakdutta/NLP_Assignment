 
 OK, you guys, I'm trying my best.
 
 All appointments on Monday, November 20 have been moved to 3 P.M.
 
 Deb:  facial, then massage
 
 Steve:  80 minute wellness massage
 
 Steve:  the spa didn't have anyone to do a facial after 2 pm so I thought 
 you'd like a longer massage.  There are facial appointments available Sunday 
 morning and afternoon.  You may want to check the website and change the 
 service.  You can have my facial appointment if you like (it's at 4 P.M.) and 
 I'll take yours.  
 
 Let me know if you'd like for me to make changes.
 
 Otherwise, see you in wineland.  Sara
