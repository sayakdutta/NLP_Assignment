 
 Mike,
 
 Tonight John and I are going to be migrated to Outlook.  Please note that 
 John has a laptop computer that is at his home.  I have spoken with Randy 
 about this and he is to be following up with you.  I would like for you to 
 accompany Greg out to the Lavorato home to complete the migration on to his 
 computer.
 
 Also, please note that I gave my and John's passwords to a lady that stopped 
 by my desk today (she is with the migration group).  Could you please confirm 
 for me tomorrow that they have been shreaded.
 
 Thanks
