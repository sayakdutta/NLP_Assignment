 Who should I speak with inside ENA to get a call to Sithe re:  Ontario market?

 Here are the Sithe talking points.  I would suggest that you give the person making the call the attached note re Ontario, so he or she has more background on the Ontario market. <<lay briefing note.doc>> <<SITHE POINTS.doc>>
