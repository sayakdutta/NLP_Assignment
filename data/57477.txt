 Steve:
 
 Approximately 3 weeks ago we sent you a Sponsorship proposal 
 for Ware Racing.
 We are curious if you've had the time to look our package over.
 We have tried unsuccessfully to reach you by phone and understand 
 that you are very busy.
 If you have time, would you please contact us reguarding this matter.
 You can reach us by phone or fax at (905) 680-1568 or on the net at

 We look forward to hearing from you.
 
 Thank-you,
 Dave/Lorna Clark
 Allied Motorsports (representing WARE Racing)
