 
 The cruise is a western Caribbean cruise on a Carnival Lines ship - leaving 
 from Galveston on the 17th.  I'm actually looking forward to it.  I may not 
 be partying with the best of them (or have a body that would entitle me to 
 even try) but a week in warm weather in a deck chair with a good book and a 
 waiter bringing tropical drinks is sounding really good right now.
 
 As for Europe, Ted is thinking London, Amsterdam, Berlin, Finland, Iceland 
 and Norway (think blond and English speaking).  Personally, I'm reasonably 
 flexible, but I'd rather go biking or barging through the wine country in 
 France or relaxing in a Tuscan hill town or villa than disco-hopping through 
 another Scandinavian capital or revisiting the bars in London.  Berlin, 
 Prague and Budapest appeal since I've never been to any of them.  Or maybe I 
 can get over to Barcelona just before your cruise with Ted - maybe with a few 
 days in the wine country or Madrid beforehand?
