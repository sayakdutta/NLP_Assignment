 
 I think you are probably correct.   Upon closure, you will probably be marking your own curves.   Having said that, you should probably begin now.

 Kevin,
 
 I think that is fine but what happens when the deal becomes final.  Will we definitively be given access to your curves?  Of course that would be easier but we have been given conflicting information on this one.  We were told that this information would be considered proprietary and that we could not depend on receiving curves all the time.
 
 Thanks,

 One group needs to mark curves.   I personally think it is easier for us to mark curves because we have traders in every region.   I simply need to make it a priority again.   I can go either way, though.   We definitely don't want two sets of curves.
 
 Let me know.

 Kevin -
 
 We are developing a process to mark estate curves.  We will be fully marking by Thursday (including vol curves) except possibly the West (still working on).  Is your group currently marking estate curves (I think someone dropped the PJM cash curves today)?  I think we should probably let the estate group begin this process so that they can be ready to go when UBS takes over - your thoughts?
 
 Kristen/Kevin - can we differentiate effective now between estate/netco curve manager so that we can start a parallel process?
 
 Thanks,
 RH
