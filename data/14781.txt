 
 Thank you for your update.  Our hearts are very heavy today for Rich and his family.
 
    
 
 I, on behalf of Infinite Energy, would like to offer my deepest sympathies to Richard Blaser, Executive Vice President of Infinite Energy, and his family.  Richard's parents were in a plane crash this past weekend.    
  
 Russ and Carol Blaser were celebrating a friend's 40th birthday with his wife by eating out in Cedar Key, Florida.  They flew out to Cedar Key and were intending to fly back to Gainesville after the celebratory dinner.  Russ Blaser was an accomplished and experienced pilot and in fact had participated in many air shows with his stunt plane.   
  
 Shortly after takeoff from Cedar Key, the plane Russ was flying crashed into the Gulf of Mexico. Richard's mom was killed and his father has not yet been found. 
  
 The date for the funeral of Carol Blaser has not yet been set.  I will relay any relevant information regarding funeral arrangements and Russ Blaser's status to those on this email list as they become available.  
  
 Please take a moment to think of Rich and his family.
  
 Darin
