 Thanks for the note.  I'll check out the book but I don't think I'll stop my 
 insulin!

 Hi Mike,
 
 I don't know if you'll appreciate the following info, but there is a book 
 called "The Cure For All Diseases" by Hulda Clark. She outlines how to cure 
 diabetes so there is no need to take insulin.  It worked for my hypoglycemia, 
 and a lot of other things.
