 Tana - this contract was done for purposes of procuring German news onto the 
 Enron Strommarkt website (enronstromarkt.de) but we are now in the process of 
 'porting' this information onto EnronOnline.  The contract is loosely worded 
 and allows us to use the VWD news on any 'single URL ' of our choice. In this 
 case, we're switching from Strommarkt to EnronOnline so no new contract is 
 required though this does now concern EnronOnline.
 
 The attached agreement is signed by Chris McKey (Enron ) but not VWD.       
 (I will  forward you an English translated version too but of course it is 
 not signed).
 
 Michael - if you have the agreement signed by VWD please fax it urgently to 
 Tana Jones in Houston.   Fax number: 1 713 345 7038.  Please also fax over 
 any other executed agreements (with third party's signature) to Tana ASAP - 
 I'm not aware of any others , are you?)  Thanks for your help.

 Angela,
 
 enclosed pls. find a copy of the above. I'll give to our translator and send 
 you the translation as soon as I get it. This will probably be next week as 
 they are quite busy at the  moment.
 
 
 
 Until then.
 
 Kathy
