 Sara,  
 
 I checked with Frank and he is not handling it.  My paralegal person is 
 Stephanie Panus, but I believe she is out of the office this week.  The 
 latest on this master negotiation was that Stephanie was reviewing some 
 comments from LDPLLC.   She was working on this comments last Wed., and she 
 said she was trying to get them done that same day.  I have not heard back 
 from Stephanie.  Currently LDPLLC is trying to get some deals done on EOL 
 with longer tenors,  and Credit as well as LDPLLC want to get this master 
 swap signed as soon as possible.  Will you please check who in legal is 
 reviewing this doc.?
 
 Thanks for your help,

 I believe Frank is handling. 
 Is there a problem?  I approved them for LPG online last Friday (I think Tom 
 Moran handled from credit).
