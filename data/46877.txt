 Mark, thanks for taking a moment to review with me the changes that Dow
 Hydrocarbons and Resources Inc ("DHRI") desires to make to the above
 referenced agreement.  You have asked me to confirm these changes in writing
 and then after you reviewed these changes with your client, you would send
 me a confirming letter which we would countersign.
 
 1.   Section 5:  At the end of Section 5(b) add, "(iv) is independently
 developed by the receiving party; or (v) was in the receiving parties
 possession prior to receipt from the other party.  In Section 5(c), in the
 first line, after "in clause 5(b)" add "(ii) or (iii).
 
 2.   Section 6: change the third line as follows:  ". . . until
 terminated by either party upon written notice to the other party, to take
 effect immediately . . .."
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions regarding these changes.
