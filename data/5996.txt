 I mostly used the review course books.  You are welcome to borrow them if you 
 like.  Otherwise, I am sure that either Kaplan or Princeton Review has some 
 good books.  Check the AIMR website.

 Bass,
 
 Long time, no talk.  How's it going?  Hope the market is treating you well!
 
 I have a question for you.  I am looking to take the CFA Level I test this 
 summer.  I missed out on a review course I wanted to take.  I remember you 
 said that you were taking the CFA, and I noticed you had a particular book 
 you were studying.  I just wanted to see if you would recommend the book you 
 studied.  If so, who produced it.
 
 I saw Kaplan produces one, but I am not sure if it is any good.
 
 
 I would really appreciate it.
 
 Late,
 GM
