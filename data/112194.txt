 My understanding is it stayed with Columbia and we have continued to transact 
 under it.  I do not know The New Power Company; Brant would probbaly be the 
 best person to review the credit and determine if we are OK with the 
 assignment.  Why are they sending us "notification" - don't they need to 
 obtain our consent?
 
 Thanks,
 Tanya

 When the Columbia purchase was done in January, did the 1/30/98 ISDA Master 
 between ENA and Columbia Energy Services Corporation stay with Columbia or 
 come over to us?  The reason that I am asking is that they have sent ENA a 
 letter notifying us of Columbia's transfer of its rights under such Master to 
 The New Power Company, so it seems as if they believe that that Master was 
 not part of our acquisition.  Who in credit needs to be aware of this if in 
 fact this Master will be assigned to New Power?
