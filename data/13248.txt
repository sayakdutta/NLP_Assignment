 
 Amy,
 
 It looks like my presence in Portland is iffy at this point.  There are other 
 ways to do the training if you still want it asap.  Otherwise, I can schedule 
 it a few weeks from now.  I'll give you the details as I confirm my situation 
 with the Portland trip.

 As of now, does this date still work for you?  I want to get out information 
 to let the employees know about the sessions - I was a bit hesitant to do so 
 before now just in case you did have to cance.
 
 I hope that you are well.
 
 Kind regards -
 Amy

 Amy, that day may not work after all.  I'll get back with you if it doesn't. 
 
  In any event, the training lasts about an hour.  I'll need a video player 
 and a projector for a powerpoint presentation.  
 
 Thanks.  Michelle

 It looks like the 26th of July works best for everyone here.  I hope that 
 this date still works for you.
 
 Can you let me know how long the sessions take and what a good number is so 
 that I can get these scheduled?
 
 Thanks and have a great weekend.
 Amy
