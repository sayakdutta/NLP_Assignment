 Jim,
 	I know that your group is following the RTO - ISO issues in Washington and wanted to know if we could be added to your distribution list on these updates?  Also, if there is anything we could help you with on this issue we would happy to do so.  We are also looking at FERC and their short list for the 5th appointee.  As you know, it is still very preliminary, but as soon as we get more information we will pass it on.  Hope all is going well and let me know if there is anything else we can do.
 
 Thanks,
 Kristin
