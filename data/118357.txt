 Mark, the following tax changes to the various financial GTC's and weather 
 swaps are those that we have spoken about and effectively adopt the approach 
 of our Master ISDA's with regard to taxation.  Just wanted to keep you in the 
 loop.  I will be out on Tuesday but, should you need to, you can follow up 
 with Jeff Blumenthal.  Best regards.

 Dave,
 
 Attached below are the OnLine GTCs that contain the appropriate U.S. federal 
 tax language.  As you'll see, our changes are reflected either by underline 
 or strikeout in each of the documents.  The 3 attachments below are as 
 follows:
 
   1.  ENA financial GTC
   2.  Enron Canada financial GTC
   3.  ENA HDD swap GTC
 
 As you know, ENA financial (credit) and Enron Canada financial (credit) GTCs 
 exist in addition to the ENA financial and Enron Canada financial GTCs.  The 
 language that we inserted in the attached ENA financial and Enron Canada 
 financial GTCs should also be inserted in the ENA financial (credit) and 
 Enron Canada financial (credit) GTCs.  In addition, there are several weather 
 derivative swap GTCs.  The language set forth in the attached ENA HDD swap 
 GTC will need to be inserted in all other ENA weather derivative swap GTCs 
 (credit and non-credit).
 
 Also, please note that the message you forwarded to me from Leslie Hansen 
 appears to relate to the U.S. state tax language to be inserted into certain 
 GTCs.
 
 Please call me at 3-5777 if you'd like to discuss further.
 
 Best regards,
 
 Jeff

 Per our (separate) discussions, I have revised the GTCs to reflect (i) the
 counterparty's representation that it is a domestic corporation (which, if
 correct, would permit us to avoid back-up withholding on reportable
 payments, if any, made pursuant to this GTC) and (ii) the requirement that
 we provide the relevant forms to the counterparty in the event the
 counterparty notifies us that it is not a domestic corporation.
