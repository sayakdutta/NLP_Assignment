 The word is that we are being purchased from the Enron estate and give Enron 1/3 profits for some term.  The deal goes in front of the bankruptcy judge on Friday.  Supposed to be a good deal.  
 
 Do you need tix for the concert?  Do you have to work Friday?  What's the weather like?  Any good fishin hole to wade or drift?

 Charlie and Bruce Robison are going to be in town for this Thursday -
 hopefully it will be a good show.
