 Cory,
 Please make sure going forward that we only include positive cash flow counterparties in the weekly projections.   Please exclude the TXU and FE positions from  the net position report as well.   We will likely begin filling the non-pool positions starting next Wednesday.

 Kevin, 
 
 Please take a look at the attached spreadsheet.  I have updated to back-out TXU and FE, both of which are negative.  Is TXU an obligation to purchase power?  If you get a minute, let's chat about this.
