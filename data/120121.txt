 On June 12, PJM will implement the Collaborative Scheduling System (CSS), a new
 scheduling tool designed to facilitate transaction schedules between New York
 and PJM.
 CSS will become part of the EES tool now used to schedule transactions from and
 to PJM neighbors.
 
 PJM will offer several two-hour "virtual" workshops to introduce the new system.
 Participants who now use EES and will use CSS are encouraged to attend one of
 these workshops.  The dates for the workshops are: May 31 at 10:00 a.m., June 5
 at 2:00 p.m. or June 11 at 2:00 p.m. The workshops will be presented on the
 internet with audio teleconference.
 
 A complete description of the new tool, the training program, and a registration
 form for the program are available on the PJM web site at
