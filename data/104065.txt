 
 Molly:  I left you a voice mail this morning about Citibank.  The file 
 reflects that you received correspondence from Citibank on 2/22/00 and Carol 
 St. Clair had propsed revisions to the existing 1/9/96 ISDA Master Agreement 
 (including changes to the CSA).  Have you agreed to those changes?  The 
 Australia office is inquiring about the status of this Master Agreement.  
 Thanks.  Sara
