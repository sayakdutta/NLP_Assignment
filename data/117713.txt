 enough to get a covered parking spot.  Oh well, may sufficient hail storm 
 damage will get me a new car!
 
 How would you like to deal with the Astros ticets?  I have a couple of 
 meetings scheduled but am pretty flexible today - maybe lunch time or when 
 you're ready to leave for the day?  Just let me know.  Call if you want - 
 713-853-7459.
