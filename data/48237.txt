 
 Several things are not very clear to me and I need to run them by you.
 
 1.  From your email it appears to me that there would be no legal reason 
 prohibiting your Australian based counterparties from trading all of the 
 products we offer, however, except for financial Australian power, the 
 contracting Enron entity will have to be the party referenced on the 
 particular product.  It appears that the only product Credit has currently 
 opened the Australian based counterparties to trade anyway is Australian 
 financial power.
 
 2.  Will you be approving the Australian based counterparties for trading?   
 Dave Forster appears to want me to approve Australian based counterparties 
 too, which doesn't make sense to me and Mark Taylor.  What are your thoughts 
 on this? I guess EnronOnline just does not want a third Legal contract they 
 are going to have to deal with on an ongoing basis.  FYI,  I currently do not 
 approve the London based counterparties.
 
 3.  The Australian company number.  Does that have to go on every 
 confirmation done with an Australian counterparty?  If it does we will need 
 to make sure that it gets put on every confirmation.  It is my understanding 
 that the confirmations for online trading will be generated from Houston so 
 we will have to provide every company number to the Houston Confirmation Desk.
 
 FYI, tomorrow at the end of the day is my drop dead time to get all the 
 counterparies approved, because the information will have to be loaded in by 
 London when they arrive for work Friday morning.
