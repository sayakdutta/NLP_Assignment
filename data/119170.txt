 
 We're almost there on the new PA language, just a little tweaking left to do.  I'm doing reviews all day today so won't be able to get it to you until Monday.  I agree with your comment on the Pop - up language - probably something to the effect of "Not at this time."

 Anything more on this.  I sent my comments on the pop up language back to you.

 Here is our first draft of the pop-up box language.  Please circulate among the appropriate members of your group and let Barbara or me know if you have any comments.  Language for the revised Password Application will follow.
