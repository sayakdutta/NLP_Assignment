 > In a crowded city at a crowded bus stop, a beautiful
 >young woman was waiting for the bus. She was decked out in a tight
 >leather mini skirt with matching tight leather boots and jacket.
 >
 >As the bus rolled up and it became her turn to get on, she became aware
 >that her
 >skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the
 >first step on the
 >bus. Slightly embarrassed, and with a quick smile to the bus
 > driver, she reached behind her and unzipped her skirt a little, thinking
 >that this would give her enough slack to raise her leg.  Again she tried
 >to make  the step on to the bus only to discover she still
 > couldn't.
 >
 >So, a little more embarrassed, she once again reached
 >behind her and unzipped her skirt a little more and, for a second time
 >attempted the step.
 >Once again, much to her chagrin, she could not raise her
 >leg because of the tight skirt. With a coy little smile to the driver,
 >she
 > again unzipped the offending skirt to give a little more slack and again
 >was unable to make the step.
 >
 >About this time, the big Texan behind her in line picked
 >her up easily from the waist and placed her lightly on the top step of
 >the
 >> bus.
 > She went absolutely ballistic and turned on the would-be
 >hero, screeching at him. "How dare you touch my body!!
 >I don't even know who you
 > are!"
 >
 > At this, the Texan drawled, "Well Ma'am, normally I
 >would  agree with you, but after you unzipped my fly three times, I kinda
 >figured that we was  friends."
