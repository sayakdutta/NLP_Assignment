 Can you please mail back an NDA with the following information within it:
 
 Prospect: 
 CMS Energy Marketing Services and Trading (Legal name)
 
 Topic:
 Using Enron's back office services to process their energy deal transactions.
 
 
 This has nothing to do with EnronOnline.  Please do not include EnronOnline 
 terminology in the NDA, as it will only delay this effort.  Thanks in advance 
 for your timely response.
