 Bill,
 
 Yesterday, we decided to look at two options for Pueblo; a 60 MW case and a 
 140 MW case.  In order to match these outputs as closely as possible with 
 available equipment, I made the following selections:
 
 Case 1
 Equipment     3 X GE LM 2500 Gas Turbine Generators with Heat Recovery and 1 
 X 22 MW Steam Turbine Generator
 Output at 95 deg F & 5000 ft   67 MW
 Output at avg. conditions (60 deg F)  73.4 MW
 Heat Rate at avg. conditions  8170 Btu/kWh (HHV)
 
   
 Case 2
 Equipment     3 X GE LM 6000 Gas Turbine Generators with Heat Recovery and 1 
 X 44 MW Steam Turbine Generator
 Output at 95 deg F & 5000 ft   130 MW
 Output at avg. conditions (60 deg F)  143.7 MW
 Heat Rate at avg. conditions  7900 Btu/kWh (HHV)
 
 There is a wide fluctuation in ambient temperature in Albuquerque and I sized 
 the blocks based on 95 deg F but used the annual average output at 60 deg F 
 for estimating power sales.  I have attached files that show the build-up of 
 the estimated EPC price for the plants. 
 
 The required power prices are projected in a simple-minded economics file 
 attached.  The projections are based on:
 
 70% debt financing at 10% rate.
 10-year project and debt life.
 8500 hours per year at average output (97% capacity factor).
 Gas at $4.40/MMBtu.
 
 The results turn out pretty much as anticipated.  Even with the larger plant, 
 we'd have to sell the power for over 6c/kWh.
