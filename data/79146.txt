       The 2002 Transwestern fuel hedges were all done with ENA.  Currently those hedges are approximately $17.0m in the money.  Our ENA hedges would certainly be rejected by a Trustee in bankruptcy.  Since these were affiliate transactions, I would assume that these positions were all layed off to a non-Enron counterparty.  Is there a way that we can get assignment of the offsetting counterparty transactions?  If not, we could have a big hole for next year.
