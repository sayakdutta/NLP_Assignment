 A husband and wife want to take golf lessons from a pro at a local country
 club. The man and woman meet the pro and head onto the driving range. The
 man goes up to hit first. He swings and hits the ball 100 yards. The golf
 pro says not bad. Golfpro: "Now hold the club as firm as you hold your
 wife's breasts". The man follows instructions and hits the ball 300 yards.
 The golf pro says "Excellent!" Now the woman takes her turn. Her ball goes
 30 yards. Golfpro: "Not bad, try holding the club like you hold your
 husbands penis." She swings and the ball goes 10 yards. Golfpro: "Not bad,
 but now try taking the club out of your mouth and hit the ball."
