 
 Ronda,
 
 I am not surprised you have no attendees from Enron.
 We can pay neither  for the conference nor for the trip to New York.
 I shall be glad to talk to you about the conference but I cannot attend in any capacity.

 Hello, the following attachment is the agenda for our weather risk
 conference to be held here in New York. I know we do have a speaker from
 ENRON (Sanjeev Khanna), but to date we have no attendees. In addition to the
 keynote speakers, there will be a panel discussion with representatives from
 all of the market sectors. Take a look, and I will ring you tomorrow to see
 if there are any questions.
 I will speak with you soon,
