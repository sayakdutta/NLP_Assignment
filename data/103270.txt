 
 Sheila Glover has requested that David Vitrella be designated as a second 
 "Authorized Trader" for the Enron Communications Investments Corp. account 
 which was recently opened with Morgan (having as its purpose the sale of 
 Rhythms stock).  The rationale for a second trader is not new to us:  in John 
 Greene's absence, no one is authorized to trade in that account.  It is my 
 understanding that the only activity to occur in this account is the sale of 
 this particular stock which will be "dribbled in" periodically.  Please let 
 me know if you have any questions.  Both Donna and Sheila are very familiar 
 with this transaction.  Sara
