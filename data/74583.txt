 Kay:
  
 I just realized that I sent you the blackline of the ENA/PPL letter
 agreement without adding the covenant on the part of PPL to use commercially
 reasonable efforts to obtain their financing as we discussed.  I will add
 this prior to circulating the letter agreement to the other side tomorrow.  
  
 FYI - Greg Lang just called to check on timing.  I advised that Enron was
 reviewing the commitment letter internally, and we would not be ready to
 respond until Tuesday morning.
