 
 Steve, 
 
 Thanks for the voicemail.  I was surprised that you were not up to speed 
 (although I probably shouldn't be).  Please talk with Joe and get is view on 
 this.  I left michael an email on my view, which is that it looks very early 
 and I don't think it is worth our time or money at this point.  Certainly he 
 wants to maintain a good relationship and watch them and maybe you can help 
 with that. 
 
 Let me know if you get any other news.
 
 Thanks,
 Mike
