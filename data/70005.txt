 felt terrible when I realized I was older than I thought!  Oh well, it just 
 goes to show you that it is all a state of mind.
 
 I'm not sure how you don't focus on development, when it is all a part of the 
 same group and process. Neat trick, though.  I wish Carlos was here to do a 
 lot of this, though.

 Thanks.  All last year I thought I was the age I am turning tomorrow, so I 
 feel like I really did gain a year.
 
 Stuart just told me he will not be focusing as much on development.  Is that 
 the same for you too?
 I just met Roger Balog (I think he was a little overwhelmed).

 Is it true that tomorrow is your birthday?  If so, Happy Birthday!!!
