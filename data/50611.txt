 I shall forward her resume to the principal of my son's old high school
 and give it to my neighbor who is a teacher at CISD.

 Hello Vince, 
 
 I stopped by to see you today 03/28/01. However, Mrs. Shirley notified me 
 that you were out of the country.  Look, I need another favor.  My wife, whom 
 you met last summer, and I  have been living in The Woodlands about a month 
 now.  We have tried, to no avail, to get her in the local school district as 
 a speech pathologist or a K-6 grade school teacher. She could easily find a 
 teaching job in the Houston Independent School District. However, I would 
 prefer that she taught locally, in The Woodlands.  I need to know if you know 
 of anyone we can contact to get her in The Woodlands School System.  I would 
 greatly appreciate if you could help us out once again.  I am attaching her 
 resume' for your perusal. Thanks A Million Vince!!!
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Datren Williams
