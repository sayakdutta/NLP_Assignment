 Dear Mr. Horton,  I have recently been made aware of a help desk analyst
 job#0000108806 that has become available in your department. I am currently
 employed with the aviation department (hangar attendant) of enron and would
 like to use my past knowledge and experience to persue my goals in the
 technology feild. I am asking respectfully if you could give me a
 recommendation or referral to ETS technology department. Anything you could
 do to help further my goals would be appreciated.
 
 
 
           Respectfully,
           Danny Jones
