 6/23/99.  Also, looks like Pat told you about Empresa.  SS
 
 
     
 
 
 
 I noticed we have a master with Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, L.L.C.  I 
 am under the impression that there is another master with Duke that is being 
 negotiated because the business guys said that the negotiations on an ISDA 
 master agreement is holding up another power trade that the Duke entity down 
 here wants to do through its US subsidiary ECT is negotiating with.  Could 
 you update me on what is being negotiated with any of the other Duke 
 entities.  Also where is Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, L.L.C. located 
 and what types of trades does the master cover?  Thanks for your help.
