 Mark - Could we arrange a telephone call with you, Mary and me this week to
 discuss the North America Energy Derivatives Committee and a proposed agenda
 for the near term - including the conference in Houston that you've been
 discussing with Mary?  There has been no meeting for some time as you know.
 Regards, Ruth

 Mark:
 
 Thanks a lot for the lists.  If it's ok with you I will get back to you on
 getting some contact names.
 
 We are looking into hotels in Houston for the Energy conference in February
 or March, 2001.  Is there any certain time in those months that wouldn't
 work for you?  Houston is becoming a very difficult place to find hotel
 availability.  The thinking was to hold an Energy conference in the U.S. in
 the first half and in the U.K. sometime in the second half of the year.  It
 has been mentioned that we should hold the Europe Energy conference in
 Amsterdam.  My thinking is that we should first hold it in London.  What do
 you think?
 
 Regards,
 Mary
 
 
     
 
 
 
 Mary:
 
 I asked for a list of major energy trading parties.  It seems to me that we
 should try again to get those on the list that are not already members to
 join
 ISDA.  Let me know if I can help.
 
 Regards,
 
 Mark

 I meant to copy you on this, but sent it before thinking.

 list
 is as follows:
 
           1.  AEP
           2.  Aquila
           3.  Coral
           4.  Duke Energy Trading
           5.  El Paso Merchant Energy
           6.  Koch
           7.  PG&E Energy Trading
           8.  Reliant
           9.  Southern Company Energy Marketing

 I hope this is of some help.
