 
 My apologies for any confusion resulting from my e-mail yesterday.  While the 
 GTC's must be finished this morning, Legal's revisions to the short and long 
 descriptions are not due until Friday August 6.  I think it would make sense 
 for us all to get together to discuss how these work early next week.  I will 
 ask Taffy to set something up.
