 Thanks Rod.
 
 Although I do not think RAC has approved the proposed transaction, I do know that RAC has gone over our models several times and, as recently as a few weeks, and has signed off on our Fair Market Value, which is some 20 to 30% below the proposed purchase price from the utility.  By copy of this to Steve (J), Steve (H) and Lian, I am asking them to start a formal process right now.
 Thanks again. Mariella

 Can you help us here?
    
 For Mariella and Jeff:    Has this divestiture been to RAC?  It will need to go, and probably sonner rather than later.
 
  
     
 I have a quick question here:
 
 In the LOI with the GoPhil., parties are required to show BoDirectors approval for the transaction.  This transaction will net to Enron approx. $100 million.  This is a divestiture and I don't know how we are handling approvals for that.  Can you help me understand the approval process and whether given such the Dec 1 deadline will be an issue?  I would think not but wanted to check.
 Thanks
