 
 Suzanne,
 
 The flights sound great timing-wise and I know exactly where that hotel is located...being within walking distance of Pike's Market is always a bonus.  I look forward to the visit as well as the opportunity to finally meet everyone I've spoken with in person.
 
 Thanks again,
 Susan Scott
 
  
     
 Hi Susan -
 Feb 7 Thursday - your air reservations are on Continental Flight 367 - coach Lv. Houston/Intcon 2:35 p.m. nonstop, ar. Seattle 5:17 p.m.
 
 February 11 - Continental #423 coach nonstop. lv. Seattle 11:50 a.m., ar. Houston/Intcon 5:57 p.m.
 
 I will not be mailing you tickets.  You will be using Record Locater VT8YST.
 
 I made hotel reservations for you (see attached).  This hotel is between Cascade Natural Gas and downtown Seattle.  Because there are 4 conventions in Seattle this weekend and the annual Northwest Garden &
 Flower Show, hotel accommodations were slim.
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions.  Have a great day.
 
 Susan
