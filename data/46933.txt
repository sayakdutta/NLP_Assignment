 Tana, I have prepared a subset index from the larger one you prepared. This 
 subset index will be attached as an exhibit to the due diligence memo that we 
 are working on with Peter Mims. The subset index includes only those 
 agreements that we deemed relevant to our due diligence review and does not 
 include content licenses or posting agreements.  Could you please prepare a 
 separate list that has only the content licenses in it?   Tthanks.  If you 
 have any questions, please give me a call.
