 thx for the invite.  i think my happy hour days are almost over.
 
  
     
 Just a reminder on the HH at Little Woodrow's Midtown for Dan this Thursday---its looking more like he will be there between 5:00 and 6:00 because Dan gets in a little later than he thought.  Please forward to anyone I may have missed.  See you guys there!
 
 Hoo Ha!
