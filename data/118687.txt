 list of proposed reference entities and if any of them have a business 
 relationship with Enron they will need to be subject to a deeper legal 
 review.  The process for that review has not yet been finalized but for some 
 potential reference entitiesit will be very time consuming (i.e. for those 
 entities where the extent and nature of the business relationship is 
 unclear).  The "soft" Chinese walls also have yet to be built for the US.  
 For those walls to be effective there may need top be training for people on 
 both sides of the walls.

 Credit are pushing to launch online credit trading for this coming Monday.
 
 Have you both "signed off" on the process, or are there issues outstanding 
 which need to be resolved, from your point of view?
