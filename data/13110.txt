 
 Mark, 
 
 Do we need to say something about the fact that V&E is representing Ecogas 
 and not the plan to ensure protection of the privilege?  MHC

 Steve,
 
 Here is some proposed language for your memo or e-mail to employees, per
 your concerns:
 ==============
 Recently, you may have noticed some activity or heard some rumors regarding
 the Ecogas 401(k) plan.  Let me assure you that the plan is sound, and that
 the assets of the plan are safely held in trust with Merrill Lynch.  The
 activity you may have noticed or the rumors you may have heard likely come
 from the fact that Ecogas has been contacted by the Department of Labor for
 a routine investigation of the plan.  In connection with that investigation,
 Ecogas has hired the law firm of Vinson & Elkins, who has visited our
 offices, to conduct a review and to make recommendations for improvement and
 for corrective action.  I cannot stress enough that Ecogas stands behind the
 401(k) plan and is committed to making the necessary improvements and
 corrections.  I know you will join me in welcoming this opportunity to make
 our plan better.
