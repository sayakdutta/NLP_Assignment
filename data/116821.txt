 
 I just spoke with Sean Crandall, the trader on these deals, and he said the 
 counterparty could be either Conoco Pipeline Co. or Conoco Power Marketing. 
 If credit has specified the latter, I'll change these deals. Just let me know.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate

 Credit called me and believes the following deals should be booked to Conoco 
 Power Marketing.  Can you check on them for me and let me know?  I appreciate 
 it.
