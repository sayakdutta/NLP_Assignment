 
 Nick:
 
  I was wondering if it would be a big problem if I end up not being able to 
 attend the grand opening.  I really want to attend, but I am having some 
 scheduling problems.
 
  Please let me know if my missing the event would create any problems.  (I 
 know I'm important, but I'm sure it would be ok for me to miss.)
 
       Steve
