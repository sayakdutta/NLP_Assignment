 That's  not  true -
 
   The Resource Report  # 6 - Geological Resources for the
 Vector P/L:  CP98-133 ;  filed 12/15/97 i
 is on page 211 of that Report.
 
 
 

 To whom it may concern:
 
 I am trying to locate Resource Report 6 - Geological Resources for the
 Vector Pipleline Environmental Report under docket # CP98-133;
 sub-docket 000 filed on 12/15/97.  In the description it says "Vector
 Pipeline Cultural Resource Rept 4 through 7.  However, the document only
 has the first Resource Report which is number 4.  Could you get back to
 me on how to obtain this information.
 
 Thanks
