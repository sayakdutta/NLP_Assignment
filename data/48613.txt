 
 Mark and I were just discussing the project yesterday.  I am out for Thanksgiving vacation all next week, but when I get back the week after that we definitely want to get it back on track!
 
  
     
 Tana, 
 
 How's everything going?  Will you guys have some time to meet next week?  It'll be a status meeting.
