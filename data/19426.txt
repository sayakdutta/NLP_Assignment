 The commission suspended Direct Access effective September 20th.
 The decision orders the utilities to stop accepting DASRs for contracts executed after 9.20.01.
 But astonishingly, the language in the proposed decision states that the Commission will take more time to consider whether the effective date should be pushed back to July 1.  In short, that battle continues.
 How the Commission will proceed in continuing to consider retroactivity is uncertain at this time.
 The Commission held over until its next meeting the decision regarding the rate agreement between DWR and the PUC.
