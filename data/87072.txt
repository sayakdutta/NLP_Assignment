 Hello,
 
 Debra, can you please forward by e-mail a copy of our GISB template to Robin 
 for delivery to her customer for review.
 
 Robin, our GISB is a standardized contract that very rarely contains any 
 specific credit covenants.  I do not provide credit terms to Legal for GISB 
 contracts and they do not keep me informed of any's execution.  Should you 
 like to have your customer review an Enfolio Master Firm Purchase Sale 
 Agreement, I would more than happy to oblige with credit terms.  (note:  
 Debra and the rest of the commodity legal group is attending a legal 
 conference in Austin and will not be returning until Monday)
