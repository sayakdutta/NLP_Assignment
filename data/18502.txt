 
 Hi Maureen:
 
 Steve should have received via fax from Scott Govenar a letter to Hertzberg 
 and Burton from the Republican leadership in the CA Legislature.  The letter 
 1) conveys a strong willingness on the part of the Republicans to work 
 together to solve the problem and 2) provides an outline of the key 
 components of a comprehensive solution.  Could you please get a copy of the 
 letter to Rosalee; and Rosalee could you get a copy of the letter to Ken 
 Lay?    Thanks very much for your help.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
