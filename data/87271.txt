 
 Steve,
 
 The necessary information for ENA has been placed in the attached draft as 
 well as a few modifications to the front page.  In addition,  I have 
 included  at the end of the GISB a list of Special Provisions for your 
 review.  
 
 Finally,  with regards to "agent",  would you fax me a copy of the Agency 
 Agreement,  or is it possible for the agreement to be in the name of Murphy 
 Exploration & Production Company. 
 
 
 
 Regards,
