 
 I have only taken a quick look at the attachment, but thought that I would 
 forward it to you.  Does it make sense?  $8MM in equipment charges for 
 us???????  Does that include depreciation (which is not equipment)?  Can you 
 give me the detail again on everything that falls under the "Consultant" 
 line?  What is it and which RC's and RC owners have items there.  Thanks.

 Guys, attached you will find a final cut on the ENA 2001 expense budget.  
 Please review and make any adjustments to your existing plan that are 
 appropriate to hit the net ENA target.  In order to stay flat year on year, I 
 split the remaining positive variance equally across the groups.  As we had 
 discussed earlier, these costs will not be allocated to the business units 
 and will be tracked on the ENA income statement below the line and the 
 accountability managed by each of you.  All outside variable costs, 
 specifically related to specific deals, will be charged to the business units 
 eg) outside legal and tax, outside technical expertise, facility costs, 
 outside research support, incremental back and mid office support for 
 specific asset management deals, specific entertainment, etc.  I look at this 
 cost structure as the minimum capacity charge we need to operate our business 
 and evaluate/manage our risks.
 
 Wes, can you please  finalize the one page plan (expenses and headcount) for 
 each group with these changes.
 
 
 
 Regards
 Delainey
