 amount is to EES (if they were to book the entire credit to Enron)?  Thanks.

 Dennis:  Just wanted to bring this item to your attention.  We've researched 
 the terms of our residential agreements and have noted that they are silent 
 as to the issue of credits/refunds.  I've asked Jeff and Mike Day, our 
 regulatory counsel in CA, for their input on whether we should refund these 
 credits back to our residential customers.
 
  Notwithstanding  the fact that the language of the original decision 
 allowing the credits does not address direct access customers, Jeff and Mike 
 recommend, given the current climate in California, that we take action to 
 refund these credits to our residential customers. 
 
  Just want to make sure you're "on board" with this before we direct CSC to 
 refund the credit back to our residential accounts...Marianne

 Diane Huddelston called Lori Pinder about an issue;  Here it is:
 
 Due to the merger btw SDG&G & Sempra Energy (about a year or less ago), a 
 savings was realized.  The CPUC said these savings must be passed on to 
 customers 1 time per year, in September.  They are called Annual Merger 
 Credits.
 
 Pursuant to all commercial contracts, Enron is entitled to keep the savings 
 (per Diane).  What about the residential customer accounts?
 
 Enron keeps the savings or should the residential customer receive?
 
 Who could handle this issue for Diane?
 
 Thanks, KC
