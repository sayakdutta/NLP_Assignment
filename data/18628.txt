 On the call on Friday, Linda asked if we could distribute materials 
 developed/used recently in California regarding the crisis and solutions to 
 try to resolve it.  Attached are:
 
 A "backgrounder" provided to the business leaders that Ken Lay met with last 
 week
 A power point presentation that is a "higher level" discussion of the more 
 detailed "backgrounder."
 
 If I missed anyone, please forward along.  If anyone has any questions, give 
 me a call at 415.782.7822.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
