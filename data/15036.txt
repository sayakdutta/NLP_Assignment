   Hey Bruce,
 
 Hope you had a good vacation.  I was just touching base to see where we're at.  I leave for Europe on June 5 and I'll be gone until July 2.  My last day in the office here will be either Thursday or Friday of this week.  Some other places you can contact me are:
 
 cell:  503-805-2557
 home:  503-656-5253

 
 Thanks,
 
 Sean
