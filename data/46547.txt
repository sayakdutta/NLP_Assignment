 
 I had a conversation with Mark Taylor this morning about your board 
 resolution.  He looked at the resolution we drafted for ECT International, 
 and he said it would also cover the Singapore trading, so I have drafted a 
 Secretary's Certificate and Incumbency Certificate for you to use.  With none 
 of the Secretary's being located in Singapore, do you need my assistance in 
 getting it signed here?  Who will you have sign the agreement?  What do you 
 usually do?
