 
 Alan,
 
 In response to your phone call,  I too had to refresh my mind its 
 MONDAY!!.    I will e-mail   later today a final version of the redline for 
 execution.  You can print two originals, sign both and send same to my 
 attention at the address below.   I will return a fully executed original for 
 your records.  Should need to trade prior to full execution of the GISB,  
 send me a fax with  signature.
 
 Please let me know if you have any additional questions or comments.
 
 Best regards,
 Debra Perlingiere
