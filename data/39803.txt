 of Enron Global Markets to make a presentation.  I will let you know.   Mark

 Mark:
 
 I write this email to discuss the Energy and Developing Products conference
 in Houston on March 6th, 2001.  Attached please find a copy of the latest
 agenda for your perusal.  Mark Taylor graciously helped me find speakers for
 the conference.  However, I just want to confirm with you your availability
 to speak on the Panel Discussion on Recent Events and the Growth of New
 Products at 9:30 AM.

 The issues to be discussed include:  Power Price Spikes; Delivery Failures;
 OPEC Production Decisions; Emissions Trading; and New and Developing
 Products.  Christophe Chassard will also speak on the panel.  This is a
 difficult panel to find speakers.  We have invited Steve Bunkin to join
 panel and still waiting for his reply.   If he accepts then we will have
 just three speakers on the panel.  Christophe said he is comfortable
 speaking about OPEC production decisions and to a lesser extent power price
 spikes.
 
 Let me know if you are available to speak.  And if so, what topics on panel
 you would feel comfortable discussing.
 
 Thanks,
 Liz
