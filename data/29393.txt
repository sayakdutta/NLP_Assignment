 FERC Audit CWIP.  The FERCERS  wil be in Omaha Monday afternoon.  Gary, Vince 
 and myself have talked to the Regulatory Group about the Budget Item v. 
 project issue they had and i believe we are comfortable with the issue.  We 
 also briefed Keith and Ray Smith on the format and likely questions focusing 
 on "controls".
 
 Also at some future staff meeting I would like to volunteer Kim Watson and 
 Martha Janousek to speak about Revenue Management and where we are in the 
 process now.  Maybe i can do alittle on business mthod patents which is 
 something we are starting to look at.
