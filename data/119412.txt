 In light of the recent tragedy, the EnronOnline team is showing support by participating in a Bowl-A-Thon  on  Friday, September 28th.  Funds raised will benefit either the New York Police and Fire Fighter's Widows' and Children's Fund or for the Cantor Fitzgerald Relief Fund- http://www.cantorusa.com/index.php (eSpeed and TradeSpark).     
 
 If you'd like to sponsor a bowler, please see the names on the attached spreadsheet and call one of them to sponsor them.  Please make checks payable directly to the charity.  This way, they can get Community Relations to match them.  If you have any questions, please call Kelly Heuertz at x 54624.
 
 Thanks
