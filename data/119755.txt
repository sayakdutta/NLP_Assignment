 Bonjour mes amies!!!!!!!!!!
 
 The hotel where I am making our reservations for in Paris can be found at the following web site: www.france-hotel-guide.com/h75006stgermaindespres2.htm      As you can see, the rates for singles are really cheap by Paris standards, and include breakfast.  Leonard and I  stayed here twice before--it's in a great location.
 
  As I've done Normandy once before and have  good information, and as I've done Paris and London several times, if you guys want, I'll prepare a suggested itinery ,with associated costs, for the portion of the trip from London to Normandy to Paris;  then we can all look at it before making final plans.  Sound O.K.??
 
 J'espere que vous avez un jour fantastique!!!  [I hope you have a great day!!]
 
 Nous pouvons avoir dejeuner quelque jours avant pour parler le francais, d'accord??  [We can have some lunches or dinners to begin practicing French before our trip, O.K.?]
