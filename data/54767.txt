 Any feedback on the latest article from Chris for EPRM??  Please let me know 
 when I can expect some feedback so I can get back to EPRM,  since they are 
 going to press in a week.

 Thanks,
 Julie

 I know that Chris is away and so siad to contact  you with any problems. Just 
 want to know the status of the article for this  month? The last e-mail from 
 Chris said it was getting a final look over from  Vince Kaminski and I should 
 expect it a few days and that was last Thursday. Any  news, as we're due to 
 go to press in a week and a day.
