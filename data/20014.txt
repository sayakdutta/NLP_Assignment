 Thanks - look forward to your input.  We have a meeting today to discuss comments due in El Paso's reallocation proceeding. How about we get you on the line next week.

 Will do.  Did you folks have a call today?  If you folks are going to have one every week, could we set up a standing time and call-in number?  Be happy to participate on these and any other issues.
 
 Best,

 Jeff - I know we are a bit tardy in getting back to you. I think a good place to start would be a close review and routine updates on the following:
 
 1. PGT Gas Accord vs. attempt to convert jurisdiction to FERC in bankruptcy proceeding. As discussed, any delay in PG&E's ability to deal with the generators on a long term basis will facilitate bypass projects into the state.
 
 2. Socal - resurrection of GIR or any plans to open the backbone to firm, path based transportation.
 
 3. Southern Trails battle with Socal to gain access to firm takeaway capacity on SoCal's system and developments in Socal's RLS tariff.
 
 4. Any issues that you believe affect our commercial efforts in California.
 
 Obviously this is a small list. I would appreciate your feedback on issues that you believe to be critical drivers.
 
 Regards,
 
 Stephanie

 Stephanie and I met with Jeff Dasovich in San Fransisco on Friday.  Jeff understands that he can play an important/strategic role in assisting ENA West Gas in understanding the regulated issues for Gas... There is no doubt that ENA has spent most of our resources in power ( and for good reason) however we need to re focus energy on gas related structures. 
 

 
 I trust this initiative will further enhance an already effective procedure. If there are any questions, let me know.
 
 regards,
