 Melinda Pharms, who has primarily worked with Becky Cantrell in the past, has been joining our calls.  I already forwarded to her the message about the rescheduled call.

 Could you please refresh my memory of the other person in the group who's working on California?  Thanks a bunch.
 
 Best,

 Works for me.  Thanks, Jennifer
 
  
     
 For this week, we'd like to cancel both the Tuesday and Thursday calls and instead reschedule to Wednesday at 9 AM PDT (11 AM CDT).   We'll try to use the same call-in number. Scott, could you let Ken know of the plan?
 
 Please let me know if this change presents a problem for anyone.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
