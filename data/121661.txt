 Just wanted to follow up with you.  I have reviewed all  of the data, and brought the power people in on this issue to  assist.
 We have placed a call to John Ewing and expect to hear back  today.  It appears that this was all effective April 1, 2001.I do not  believe that John has a choice in running.  It is quite likely that he has  had his opinion heard through the Cogeneration Council.
  
 I will let you know, but I would move forward for May  2001.
