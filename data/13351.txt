 
 Pat,
 
 I have reviewed this agreement and provided my comments under a separate 
 email.  I would appreciate your review of Section 4.14 in particular, given 
 your familiarity with the compensation plans and benefit plans.  In terms of 
 timing, your comments probably can go into the next draft, but if you have a 
 chance to look at 4.14 today, it would be great!
 
 Thanks a lot!
 
 Michelle

 Attached is a mark-up of the PSA with Bidder A, which incorporates most of
 the Bidder A's comments.  As discussed, we have attempted to include those
 comments proposed by Bidder A when possible and yet preserve the more
 important "materiality protections for Seller.   The draft is marked against
 Seller's bid document form, however, I have asked Lehman to send to me
 electronically the Bidder A form.  Upon receipt, I will prepare and
 distribute to you a compare-rite which will show the Bidder A comments which
 we didn't accept.  In this draft, please note the following:
 
 1.  Enron should confirm and advise whether the delayed closing date (April
 2001) as reflected in Section 3.1 is acceptable.
 
 2.  The tax provisions  include V&E's comments, however Enron Tax personnel
 should consider carefully the "after tax basis" concept and definition,
 Section 4.9 and Article 11.
 
 3.  The appropriate Enron business people should provide input regarding the
 proper thresholds and amounts for (i) the Deductible Amount, (ii) the
 liability cap, (iii) Section 4.13 and Section 6.3.
 
 4.  The appropriate Enron business people should provide input regarding the
 provisions in Section 4.16 (Insurance) including the continuing post-closing
 insurance obligations.
 
 5.  The appropriate Enron personnel should advise us regarding the proper
 procedures for Buyer to participate (observatory capacity) in the
 post-signing business in accordance with Section 7.15.
 
 Once you have had the opportunity to review the attached agreement, please
 give me a call to set up a time to discuss your comments and required
 revisions.
