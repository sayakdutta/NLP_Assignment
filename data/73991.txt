 
 Scott,
 
 I'll give you what we got from FCE when we meet at 300.  Remind me if I 
 forget!

 1.  Can I get a copy of the FuelCell Energy purchase order form.  Jeff said 
 that you would have a copy.
 2.  I forwarded to you a memo from Bingham that discusses the permitting 
 requirements for the proposed projects.  FYI--I plan to call Bingham today 
 with some follow up questions.
 3. I forwarded to you a memo by ENSR on the air permit requirements for fuel 
 cells.
 4.  Please let me know when you can meet today to discuss the MOU.
