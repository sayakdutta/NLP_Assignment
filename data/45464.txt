 I believe Leslie Hansen has a copy of it.  Unfortunately, our files are 
 packed up for the move tomorrow and I can't check to see if I have a copy.  I 
 left Genia a message to see if she could check Leslie's file, but if she's 
 not in the office, Leslie may not mind if you look through her Ameren file.
 
 
     
 Rhonda,
 
 Can you provide me with the Agency Agreement or other documentation you may 
 have received with respect to this agency relationship.  Thanks!
