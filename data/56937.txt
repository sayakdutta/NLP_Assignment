 
 Molly,
 
 Please, make arrangements for the interview with this candidate for
 a  trading position. Interviews with John Lavorato, Jeff Shankman,
 Gary Hickerson, Stinson Gibner.
 
 I talked to him in New York and he is considering
 other opportunities, so we have to act fast.
 I think John will like him more than Punit.
 
 
 
 Thanks
