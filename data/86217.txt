 
 I will hopefully have a meeting today with whom ever will be taking over.  Would you like to attend?  If not, I will make myself available for you if you want to meet. Also, I have put all relevant files on in the o:\gas structuring\tenaskaIV folder. Not sure you have access, but Ed can get them. Attached is a file that contains some cliff notes.
  
 
 Good Luck,
 Joe
