 
 Deal NN6788.1 with Citibank has been killed.  This was an EOL deal that 
 Citibank and John Arnold agreed to cut in half.  Deal QF9221.1 was booked in 
 Dec. for half the volume of the original deal.  Unfortunately, deal NN6788.1 
 was not killed when we booked the new deal.  Please call me with any 
 questions.
 
 Thanks,
