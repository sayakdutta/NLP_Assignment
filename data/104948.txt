 
 In Part C. Financial Swaps of your report, please clarify two "preparing 
 Master Swap" entries:
 
 (1) is "Edes" meant to be "Eden", each LDC activity?
 
 (2)  What is "CGC"?
 
 The "under discussion" entries are unknown to us:
 
 (1)  Piedra del Aguila
 (2)  PDA
 (3)  Wintershall
 (4)  Quintana
 (5)  Minera Alumbrera
 (6)  PAE
 
 Thanks.  Sara
