 any likely candidates.  Danny Clark, who used to work in Deal Clearing & 
 Documentation for ECT a couple of years ago, is in EES as far as I know.  He 
 was knowledgeable and meticulous, understood trading as he was a risk book 
 administrator in a previous life.  Have you considered him?  Give me a couple 
 of days to think about potential candidates from within ENA, and I will get 
 back with you.  --Sally  
 
 
    
 Well, we're a few years behind you, but one of my goals is to set up a 
 confirm desk for EES.  John Echols told me he gave you a call to see whether 
 there were any candidates from your shop for whom this might be an 
 opportunity.  Please let me know if  any background or perspective would be 
 helpful. 
 thanks.
