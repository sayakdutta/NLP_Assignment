 Any interest in taking a look at this?  If it is clean and NETCO can get it for $0.50 on the dollar and if they dont need to close for several weeks, it might be worth having Tycholiz look at it.

 EES has been soliciting bids for some of its larger markets. (CA, IL, NY, OH, etc)  To date the bids have been dismal.  We are down to one player looking at one market and they are bidding $0.30 on the dollar. ($US)  These deals are clean and could be managed fairly easily by NETCo.  It might be a stretch, but this morning, management suggested we find out if NETCo can do some due dilligence at this time and determine if we want to bid on some of the book.  I am available at (713) 345 4441 if someone wants to discuss.
