 finally decided.  I would suggest that we remain vague about the whole thing 
 until the deal, if it happens, is signed.  Michelle

 Hector,
 Please clarify this issue that came out of the meeting on Friday:
 
 My group heard the following statement:
 
 If you get a comparable offer from the new company (same title and same 
 salary) and you decline the offer then
 you are basically resigning from Enron.  You will not be placed into the 
 redeployment pool and you are not eligible for 
 a severence package.
