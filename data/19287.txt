 
 Let me see what I can do.  So this is all about sourcing, or are you aiming higher?
 
 
     
 
 The pilot is with the sourcing group within Energy Services.  The first
 event should launch this week or next.  All ahead of schedule because our
 professional services team got stuck in Houston with the WTC tragedy and
 just continued working on the project.  I have heard that Enron is VERY
 happy with the pilot and intends on introducing our application all over
 Enron.  Our Sponsor is Dick Leibert-VP of Sourcing Risk Management for EES.
 The project lead is a manager named Rudy Sutherland-he's been here for 6
 years and knows everyone.  He's a character and a really good proponent.
 
 I was hoping to have the meetings with Deal Bench this week, but that
 probably won't happen.  How about October 4th?  It looks like that's a date
 that works for both Ian and me.  Will that work for your deal bench guy?
 
 Thanks so much, Jeff.

 OK, I'm getting the meetings set up.  What day do you want?  And what
 about the pilot--need info, over.  And who's you're knight in shining
 armor in EES?
 
 Best,
 Jeff
