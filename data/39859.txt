 You are clear to sign CSN with ICC-administered arbitration in Brazil.

 John;
 
 I am hoping to close a PPA with CSN on Friday.  The nominal value of the deal 
 is approximately US$6million for a 13-month term.  I am fighting to get 
 ICC-administered arbitration in Brazil as a dispute resolution mechanism.  
 CSN insists on MAE mediation & local courts (which is unacceptable to us).  
 In case we reach an agreement, can I go ahead with arbitration in Brazil ?  
 Have you talked to Michelle Blaine or Mark Headicke yet ?
 
 Tks,
 
 Sami
