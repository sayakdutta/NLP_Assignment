 Em.
 
 Quick update:  I may try to come over Oct 5 - 10 instead of the 4 - 9 so that 
 I can at least spend a little time with Katy.  How will that work for y'all?

 P.S. - Thought you'd like to know that I am doing well in regards to the Ted 
 situation.  I'm actually kind of glad he took this week long vacation...that 
 whole out-of-sight, out-of-mind theory really works.
