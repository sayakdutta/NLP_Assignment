 
 Joe,
 
 Stan Horton has been invited to attend a series of meetings associated with  
 INGAA in Tokyo.  I believe that Stan is the Chairman of INGAA.  There are 
 some Tokyo companies that are a part of the organization.  Bill Smith, CEO of 
 Sonat (now El Paso) and will be talking about LNG and Japanese requirements 
 and will be going to Tokyo.  Stan has asked both Sherriff and me if this is 
 worth his attendance.  I thought you would be the best answer to that.  I 
 also told him that you could represent Enron very well in any meeting in 
 Japan. 
 
 Please call Stan at 713 853 6177 and discuss with him.  He can fill you in 
 better on the details.  Your call.
 
 Thanks, 
 mike
