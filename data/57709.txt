 
 Can we also get something in the stip that limits the market making activity 
 or at least promises a reexamination of the scope of the market making 
 activity after some period of time.  Also, can we strengthen the language to 
 give us something beyond simply a right to file  -- which is a right we have 
 anyway.

 Attached is the proposed Stip to allow PJM to move forward as an RTO.
 
 In the Stip, we argue that PJM should be approved by FERC but condition our 
 acceptance on a FERC process to unify the Northeast markets.
 
 My only comment is to delete the final WHEREAS paragraph on congestion 
 management.  
 
 While our ability to later stop PJM from being an RTO is limited, I believe 
 that this gives us the ability to drive a consolidation of the Northeast 
 markets - which is one of the goals of the East Power desk.
 
 In addition, I think that the overall direction of PJM in commercializing its 
 software is a good activity for our interest - even if we don't want 
 everything in their package.
 
 Sarah is out until Monday when we need to get back with PJM.
