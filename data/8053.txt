 
 I will be out of the office on vacation on Friday, March 2 and Monday, March 
 5.  I will check messages at the end of both business days.  My assistant, 
 Patti Thompson ( x35926) will have contact numbers for me.  Since I will be a 
 chaperone for my daughter and 80 other girls from the high school drill team 
 at state competition in Dallas, it is unlikely that I will be easily 
 reachable during the day.  
 
 I will be back in the office on Tuesday, March 6.
