 
 I tried to call you this week about this, but I understand from your 
 voicemail that you are out. Then I ran into Jeff and he said it was being 
 handled and that there was nothing for me to do. I will be in Portland next 
 week if you want to talk about this matter. As far as the request to Avista, 
 I think that we should make such a request, preferably from our business 
 contact--a short and sweet letter should do.

 Re-sending.  Hopefully you can print this one.
 
 In connection with the APEA matter, we have been informed that Avista (Avista 
 manages Clark County PUD's gas supplies for its facility) has transaction 
 tapes related to Clark's declaration of force majeure that may be of 
 interest.  
 
 It is possible that we should send a request to Avista to retain the tapes 
 for the dates 12-6-00 through today in case a dispute arises over the 
 declaration of force majeure.  Do you think that would be prudent, and if so, 
 how would you like to go about making the request?
