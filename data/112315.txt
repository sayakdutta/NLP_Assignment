 I would think that Alan Comnes would be good (if he can make it) to go.

 Please review Diana Moss's message and the attached agenda below for the upcoming American Antitrust Institute's market monitoring conference.  Also, please let me know if you would be interested in attending, and if not, whom you would recommend that I invite to attend on Enron's behalf.  Thank you.

 Hope everyone is well.  Attached is the final agenda for the AAI
 conference on market monitoring. The date is December 11 at NRECA's HQs
 in Arlington.  I appreciate all your input and help with putting this
 together.  We would like to invite about 40 people and give APPA, NRECA,
 and Enron 3-5 slots each at the table.  You can:  (1) invite people
 yourself (please let me know who they are when they confirm their
 attendance) or (2) let me know who to invite and I will e-mail them
 myself.
 
 Thanks,
 Diana Moss
