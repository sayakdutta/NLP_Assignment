 letter we submitted on Tuesday.  Freeman's very anxious to do a deal for 200 
 MWs from the West Desk and then start talking about a deal for power from 
 Parquet's Pastoria plant.  Credit is of course the issue and Calger's told 
 them that unless the credit issue is bulletproof it's not going to work.  See 
 Chris' comments below.  It looks like progress is being made, but the details 
 will make it or break it.  Any thoughts?  Might make sense to discuss on the 
 call.  Please forward along to others.  Thanks.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 CDWR is proposing to all potential suppliers the following security package 
 for new PPA's:
 
 1) Irrevocable PUC Order / Agreement that "locks in the revenue stream" for 
 CDWR to cover the PPA costs.
 
 2) PPA covenant that the power supplier has payment priority over any debt, 
 including the contemplated debt issue
   - the concept is that the supply is the operating cost and any debt would 
 be subordinate
 
 3) PPA Covenant that their is a uniform package to all suppliers; no more 
 favorable terms or priority to ayone, no L/C, etc.
 
 
 Subject to definitive language, CDWR is trying to get people to buy into this 
 general plan.  What do people think?  Please try to shoot holes in this.  
 Please forward to the appropriate legal, regulatory and credit folks to air 
 this out.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Chris
