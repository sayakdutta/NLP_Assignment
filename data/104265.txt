 65% Burlington owned, I understand) but I was contacted by Ranabir Dutt 
 (X35274) to review an ISDA and 10 year rate swap for Lost Creek and Barclays 
 Bank PLC..  I told Ranabir to contact credit.  He said that was Enron was 
 immediately selling its interest.  The swap becomes effective 9/15/00.
