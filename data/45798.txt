 the corporate documents of the company, so it should apply to all 
 agreements.  Can you send me up a copy of the Password Application and I will 
 give Steve Norris a call.  Thanks.

 Tana,
 
 We now have an application from Tembec, Inc.   Steven Norris, as Treasurer, 
 is the one signing the Password Application for Tembec.   When John Cummings 
 met with him last week, Steve stated that he would be involved in setting up 
 the users for Physical transactions.
 
 After reading the requirements below, it sounds like the two signature rule 
 applies to Financial transactions only.
 
 In other words, can we set up Steve as well as his users with Physical access 
 without two officers' signing?
 
 If so, then we could get them on-line with Physical access and then work on 
 whatever we need for Financial access.
 
 Thanks for your help!

 On the 10/05/00 List:  Tembec, Inc.'s bylaws require that agreements signed 
 by the company must be signed by any two of the following officers:   the 
 President or a Vice President together with any Director, Secretary or 
 Assistant Secretary.  If you are going to trade with them online you must 
 ensure that the Password Application gets signed by those officers, or if not 
 by those officers, they must provide a resolution if any officer except those 
 above signs the documentation.  Because of this signatory restriction 
 EnronOnline was hesitant to open them for financial trading.  It's up to your 
 group, but you must comply with these special signatory requirements.  If you 
 would like Legal to pass on the documentation if you are unsure, forward it 
 up to me.
