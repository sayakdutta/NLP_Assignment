 
 I've auto-scheduled deals 566424 and 566426, and I'm including the Real Time 
 spreadsheet for 4/9. The volumes I see in this sheet match the deals in our 
 Scheduling system exactly (deal in question was 576512). Please let me know 
 if this sheet is different than the one you were given, or if we've got 
 another problem. And let me know if those first two deals show up on your 
 CARP report.
 
 Thanks for your time on this,
 Kate
 
 
 
 
   
  
 Kate,
 Thanks for the update.  The changes you have made to deals 566424.1 and 
 566426.1 are not reflected on the carp report - maybe these need to be 
 auto-scheduled??  As for 576512.1 I've added the hours in question to the 
 spreadsheet.  If you need more clarification, please give me a call.
 
 
 
 Thanks
