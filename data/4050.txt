 There has apparently been some misunderstanding regarding the scope of 
 calculations that must be covered under the Post ID's submitted for EOL 
 reporting each night. Many desks are turning in post IDs which only cover 
 books in which EOL activity has taken place, thus ommitting many other 
 non-eol trades. What is needed is post IDs which will collectively cover the 
 entire universe of gas trading which has taken place on a given desk. In 
 running the collective post ID's we need to be able to capture all trading 
 which has taken place on a given day and the scope of the post ID's must 
 cover this.
