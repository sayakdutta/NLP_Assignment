 The only way to know exactly what agreements are outstanding is to do an 
 audit of the software.  Many of the agreements have been taken in Enron 
 Corp.'s name which is the company policy.

 Attached is what I hope is a pretty complete list of the EnronOnline 
 contracts I have been made aware of.  There are a few I have open questions 
 about  or am waiting to receive copies of the contract.  Can each of you 
 please take a look and think about whether there are any others we may be 
 missing.  Again, my time frame is short here, so if I can get your response 
 promptly I would be most appreciative.
