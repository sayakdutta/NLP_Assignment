 
 OK, here's the list:
 
 Mondavi's always a classic, and up the hill is La Famiglia (Mondavi brand 
 that's a sweet view, great place to have a picnic lunch, and it has some neat 
 brique-braque.
 Hess collection.
 Sterling.
 Jarvis--truly amazing (and ostentatious--wait till Beth sees the woman's 
 restroom!) But you must call NOW to try to get in.
 Cordonui (sparkling wine) also has a very lovely view.
 Stag's Leap.
 Up valley (Calistoga way) is Chateau Montellana (sp?), which has really 
 wonderful wine.
 Finally, if you would like, I might be able to tap into a connection and get 
 you in at Opus (Mondavi--maybe one of the best wines, dare I say, anywhere).  
 Please let me know if you'd like to do Opus, and I'll get on it pronto.  And 
 if you want to do Jarvis, call now!
 
 
 Hess Collection.  Opus.  Sterling.  Mondavi.  Jarvis (if you can get in).
