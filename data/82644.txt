 
 Daddy,
 
 I hope I'm not overstepping my boundaries, if I am, so sorry, but....I wanted 
 to find out from you if everything is okay financially with you and Mom.  
 
 
 I need to know now, rather than later, if we need to set up a game plan for 
 you guys.  Also, you don 't have to be emotional about borrowing money from 
 me, nobody else is (smile).  After all, I owe you one!!
 
 Love Bernie!
