 Just wanted to update the status with the ISDA.  I believe that you have received a copy of the new draft with all of the changes that we've agreed to.  If you guys approve of this draft, we can have an executable copy drawn up and sent to you.  As for the outside council opinion, Sara Shackleton is out of the office until next tuesday and her assistant doesn't know how to proceed with this process.  We will have to wait for Sara's return in order to facilitate that process.  I have sent her an email so that we can get started right away.
 
 Let me know if there is anything else that you need from me or if you have any questions.  I do hope you are able to enjoy the long weekend!
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kim
