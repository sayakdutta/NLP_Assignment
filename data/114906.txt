 
 I have changed the following deals to reflect a monthly expiry frequency 
 instead of daily:
 
 483753
 483759
 483765
 483766
 
 Since I don't enter options very often, and have only done daily options 
 before, I'm still getting familiar with all the different parameters of the 
 deals. I'm sorry for the confusion. Thanks for catching that.
