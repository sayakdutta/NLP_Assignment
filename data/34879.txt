 Hey Chris,
 
 Ken told me you called.  He thinks it was about some "deal".  But I know
 better.
 
 I haven't heard anything back yet, from the Enron NA group, but Tom Hermanic
 sp? from HR
 called me as I was walking out for lunch (I think in regards to EES).  I'll
 be calling him back later today.
 
 I'll keep you posted Chris.
