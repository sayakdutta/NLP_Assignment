 Dear Susan -
 
 As per our phone conversation of last week, attached for your review please 
 find
 a revised draft (both clean and blacklined) of the Schedule to the ISDA Master
 Agreement. The attached draft incorporates all of Morgan's comments and should
 be self-explanatory. The motivation behind many of our comments was a 
 conscious
 effort to keep the credit terms nearly identical to those already agreed to 
 with
 other Enron entities.
 
 Please review the attached and feel free to call, fax or e-mail me with any
 questions or comments.
 
 Sincerely yours,
 Mike Stolfi

      Attached for your review and comment is a draft of the Schedule and 
 Credit
 Support Annex to the referenced agreement.  It is our intention to replace the
 existing Master Energy Price Swap Agreement dated as of May 28, 1992 between
 Enron Risk Management Services Corp. (now known as Enron North America Corp.)
 and Morgan Guaranty  (the "Existing Master Agreement") with the ISDA Master
 Agreement.   Under the exisiting Master Agreement, Enron Corp. executed a
 $50,000,000  Guaranty in favor of  Morgan Guaranty. The draft ISDA Master
 Agreement includes our updated form of Guaranty.  We can either amend the
 exisiting form of Guaranty or amend and restate the exisiting Guaranty with 
 our
 updated form of Guaranty.
 
      Should you have any questions or comments, please  call either Sara
 Shackleton (attorney) at (713) 853-5620 (email address:
