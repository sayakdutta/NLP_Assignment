 Galen's heart catheterization yesterday showed two major blockages, one 99% and the other 75%.  The doctors at St. Lukes installed two stints in the artery to repair these blockages.  Galen said his chest is pain free and the tightness is gone.  His incision on his thigh is very sore and he has not yet been allowed to get out of bed to walk.  I spoke to him this morning and he sounded fairly upbeat and said he should be out of the hospital later on today.  He was concerned about whether he would be able to come in to work on Saturday to process reservation billing.   I assured him that Sheila and I had it covered and he did not need to worry about it.
