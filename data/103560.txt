 I don' think we ever replaced Aquila with an ISDA.  We sent one out, but they 
 then decided to use Utilicorp, right? I'll put Vitol on our list, how high of 
 a legal priority is this?  (not high for credit).  Thanks

 We recently did about 20 weather trades with Vitol and I "confirmed" these 
 under the 1995 energy price swap master (bad for weather) but incorporated 
 ISDA definitions.  I think we should work toward replacing this master with 
 an ISDA to eliminate the problem.  We did the same with Aquila which solved 
 the weather problem (and I realize the Aquila is a bigger trading partner 
 than Vitol).  Can someone generate credit?  Thanks.  Sara
