 I still have not received any comments/feedback on the ISDA Schedule draft
 forwarded to you on 7/27/01.  The last time we spoke, you said that you were
 still waiting on some comments from your credit group.  I would very much
 like to get the process moving again.  If there is something I can do to
 expedite the process please let me know.  Also, please let me know if you
 have tried to send something to me that hasn't gone through.  My email
 address and phone number are below.
