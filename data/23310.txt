 Hardie, James we have been reviewing Corporate Legal allocations to EEL.  As EEL covers the below services in house we do not anticipate any charges from corp for 2002.  Could you please remove the allocations to EEL.    If you have any questions please get back to either myself or Baldip Dosanjh on x35589.
