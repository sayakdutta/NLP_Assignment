 preparing the documents.  See Part 2 (Tax Reps) and the end of the document 
 which has our "choices" of tax forms.
 
 I thought it might be helpful to be very basic about withholding issues, 
 etc., why we need the tax reps, and what questions we could ask upfront about 
 a party that would help us select an appropriate tax module.  We tend to not 
 "think" and expect a party "fill in the blank" when we are preparing draft 
 documents.
