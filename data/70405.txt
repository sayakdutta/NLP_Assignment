 
 I suggest we give GE a time line for completing each of the break out 
 contracts.  I'm unfamiliar with the individual project requirements, so I'm 
 asking  your help.  I believe City of Austin is ready to go as soon as the 
 form is complete, and it could be a great candidate for working on 
 immediately.  I know the ESA project has some time sensitivity as well.
 
 Please let me know what you think.
