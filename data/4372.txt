 My thoughts for the trip:
 
 Friday:
 
 Everyone says that you have to see the zoo if you are in San Diego.  Even- if 
 you don't particularly like zoos.  Everything I read says that it will take 
 at least half a day.  I say we hit that Friday morning through early 
 afternoon.  Spend mid-afternoon near the hotel- beach area- suppose to be 
 shopping, etc. near there.  Then go to the game.  When we get back that 
 night- we can walk on the beach!
 
 Saturday:
 
 Visit Balboa Park.  See the Botanical Gardens, in other musuems/gardens in 
 the area that look interesting.  If we aren't sick of seeing animals, there 
 is suppose to be a wonderful Wild Animal Park that gives trolley or walking 
 tours (the tours are only like an hour and a half).  After that- there is a 
 ferry you can take across the bay to the Coronado Island to see the Hotel del 
 Coronado.  It is suppose to be a really neat place.  Then- you we can finish 
 the day in the Gaslamp Quarter downtown.  It is suppose to have a "lively 
 evening street scene" and live music.
 
 What do you think?  Let me know- so I can look up times that all of these 
 open- if we are interested.
