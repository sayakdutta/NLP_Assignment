 Participants: 
 
 Last Friday, January 26th, the Special and Correcting  Invoices for the 
 Southern 
 California Edison  (SCE) default were due and there were some Participants 
 who 
 failed to comply with Schedule 2. Section 4.3.2. of the PX  Tariff which 
 states, 
 "All payments by  the PX Participants shall be made to the PX Clearing 
 Account 
 via the Fedwire System for funds to be received at the PX  Clearing Account 
 no 
 later than noon PPT on  the Payment Due Date." 
 
 Additionally, Schedule 2, Section 5.5 of the PX  Tariff requires the PX to 
 identify such  Participants to all other affected PX Participants by the most 
 expeditious means available.? In accordance with Section  5.5, here is a list 
 of 
 PX Participants not in  compliance with Section 4.3.2. for the SCE default: 
 
 ?? American Electric Power Service  Corporation 
 ?? Arizona Public  Service 
 ?? Los Angeles Department  of Water and Power 
 ?? Pacific Gas  & Electric 
 ?? Sacramento  Municipal Utility District 
 ?? Salt  River Project 
 
 Each PX Participant's pro-rata portion of the  shortfall from the 
 Participants 
 mentioned  above will be communicated to them individually in the next couple 
 of  
 days.? If you should have questions, please  call Clark Cheng at 626-537-3243 
 or 
 Chris  Anderson at 626-537-3377. 
 
 Thank You.
