 I just spoke with Bill Morrow and he has a request.  Peoples is holding their 
 April 4th Board of Directors meeting in Houston to highlight their production 
 business.  Tom Patrick would like Enron to give the Board members a tour of 
 our trading operations sometime between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m.  He has also 
 suggested that we provide an update of enovate as another agenda item.  I 
 realize this is very advance notice, but I thought I would give you both 
 heads up so that you could try to hold this time open on your calendars. 
 
 Thanks - Gregg
