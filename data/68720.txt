 
 Asa & Joy,
 
 I just wanted to take a minute and thank the two of you for your generosity 
 this past week.  My friends and I had a terrific time and everyone really 
 enjoyed your condo.  The weather was terrific and the fish put up a 
 formidable challenge.  We are very interested in renting the condo from you 
 guys during the season this year.  I requested that the cleaning charges this 
 time be put on my credit card.  Please let me know if  they charge you guys 
 anything.  Thanks again.  We look forward to seeing you guys soon.
 Phillip
