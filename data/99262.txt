 
 Disregard my previous messageabout this case. Thanks for your assistance in=
  this matter.
 
 
 
 

 
 
 This morning I received a copy of service of process that was served on Cog=
 en Technologies Linden Venture in the Roger Atkinson matter.  Cogen Technol=
 ogies Linden Venture had previously been served with a summons and complain=
 t in the Atkinson matter in mid April.  I forwarded the matter to El Paso E=
 nergy Company, who had purchased ENA's interest in the Cogen companies effe=
 ctive late February 2001.  El Paso retained Ed Fanning of McCarter & Englis=
 h to represent Cogen's interests.  We have worked with Ed in other Cogen ma=
 tters before, and I have found him to be both effective and efficient.  Thi=
 s matter relates to personal injuries allegedly suffered by Atkinson while =
 working at a construction site at the Linden facility in December 2000.  Da=
 vid Waterson of El Paso recently called me concerning potential defense and=
  indemnity obligations that El Paso believes NEPCO may owe Cogen with respe=
 ct to this incident.  We will need to review NEPCO's contract with Cogen to=
  determine if any such obligations exist.
 
 The document that I received today is a Notice of Motion to Consolidate and=
  to Compel Inspection.  This motion seeks to consolidate the Atkinson v. Co=
 gen case with a case that was apparently also filed in New Jersey state cou=
 rt as Roger Atkinson v. JEDI Linden and NEPCO and to compel an inspection o=
 f the construction site where the accident allegedly occurred.  I have aske=
 d Becky Stephens whether we have received service of process on either JEDI=
  Linden or NEPCO.  To date, we have not.  However, I expect that service of=
  process is in the works, and I have asked Becky to be on the look out for =
 it.  As this new suit also apparently concerns personal injury claims, I am=
  forwarding a copy to both Rob and Bob, so that you can begin to process an=
 d investigate the claim in your usual manner.=20
 
 Please let me know if there is any other information you need in order to b=
 egin our review for potential defense/indemnity to Cogen.  Thanks. =20
