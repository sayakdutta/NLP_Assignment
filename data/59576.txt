 thank you
 
 
  
     
 kam,
 
 i created a folder within Netco / West called "Summary P&L" and put the sum p&l and the phillip/mike email file in there.  fyi, neither report will work at the moment, as the macros are pointed to the old pnl's.  once the new pnl's are created, it won't be tough to get them running, just let me know.
 
 thanks,
 -rb
 
 
  
     
 We are finalizing the list of files to be moved over to Netco today.  Please look in O:\erms\erms_adm\Netco\West and if there is a file you used to run, (price reports, the wood report, broker, desk to desk, consolidated P&L for the website, etc.) that you don't see out there now, please save a copy to this directory this morning.
 
 Thanks
 
 KK
