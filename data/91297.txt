 One clarification,  we have not executed contracts for 120,000,  only 106,500 I think-  otherwise ok.  MK

 Attached is a revised, red-lined version of the extension letter. I believe that I addressed Keith's question to his satisfaction, so I haven't added the additional language that he suggested regarding the timing of the removal of the existing compressor units at Stations 1, 2 and 3. Please let me know if you have any additional comments. Thanks.
