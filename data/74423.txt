 Thanks,

 Please provide final GSA so that I can forward to Jode.  Tasking Letter is not processed until GSA is executed and language has been agreed upon.  I will process once I received the executed GSA from Jode.  
 Kay, I have a note that you would like to see if before I added to the approval process.
  
 Thanks and best regards,
  
 Adriana

 Allan,
  
 There comments appear to me to be more commercial.  I'm not bothered by them.
  
 Adriana, have you had a chance to give the tasking letter some thought?  It would be good to be able to wrap this up at one time.
  
 Thanks,
