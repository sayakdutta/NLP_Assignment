 had known that...!!!

 Hey, my vote's in!  As soon as I was aware of the voting, I dropped what I 
 was doing and cast my vote for the most deserving person, Anthony 
 Campos-----I mean, Tana Jones.

 I do believe if I got just one more vote for the Chairman's Award this year, 
 I just might double my tally of last year (one vote).  With such an increase 
 in my voter approval rating I just make have a landslide victory this year!
 
 The White House may become an option...
