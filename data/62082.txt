 Attached is an e-mail we received via the Enron web site.  Would you or someone from the gas trading group contact this gentleman?  If you would prefer not to respond, please refer it back to me for handling.  Thanks.

 I am with the Idaho Public Utilities Commission and am trying to find out more information on market and financial risk management devices.  Enron appears to have one of the largest varieties of measures and is extremely well respected in this field.
 
 Can you provide some information about the Market & Financial Risk Management products that you provide for the US Natural Gas Industry.  I am looking for pricing information  as well as availability.  Information pertaining to the Northwest would be greatly appreciated.  For example cost of a natural gas future (range of premiums)  Cost of weather insurance based on what measure? 
 
 If you do not have that kind of information but can point me in the right direction it would be greatly appreciated.
 
 Thank you in advance for your assistance,
 
 Michael Fuss
