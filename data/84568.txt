 
 Chris,  Attached is a draft of the letter agreement between ENAP and ENA and 
 Enron South America.  Please review and forward any comments you have.   
 There is an existing Confid. Agreement with ENAP which runs through January 
 21, 2002.  The letter I have attached piggybacks off of this existing CA.     
 
 Does Enron South America have local counsel who can answer whether certain 
 provisions in the Agreement, such as choice of Texas law, are valid under 
 Chilean law?  We need to verify this or Texas law may not be binding.
 
 Let me know if you want to discuss or have any questions.
