 You Have the Power
 
    California is facing a serious shortage of electricity this summer.=20
 
    No major power plants have been built in California for ten years. This=

 year?s below-normal rainfall threatens hydroelectric supplies. And as=20
 temperatures climb, so does demand.
 
    We?re doing all we can to help. We?re working 24/7 to keep our power=20
 plants running and speed construction of new facilities.
 
    You can help by conserving electricity at home and work, and by urging=

 your neighbors to do the same. You have the power to make a difference =01.=
  just=20
 by flipping a switch.
 
    We?re all in this together. We?re all part of the solution.
