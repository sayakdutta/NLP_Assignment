 
 Please keep this confidential at this point.  It's the agenda for the 
 California "subcommittee" meeting on Tuesday that I mentioned in an earlier 
 note.  They were unable to reschedule the meeting, which starts at 10 AM 
 tomorrow, but we're on the subcommitte and  will have very good access to the 
 final product, so I'm not too concerned about missing the "kickoff" meeting.  
 Folks in California are really looking to us to help figure out item #2 
 "forward contracting."  It would be very useful to discuss this outline 
 tomorrow while we're all together.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Attached is a discussion agenda for tomorrow's CESG meeting at 10:00 at
 the Chamber of Commerce.  Our objective for tomorrow is to move through
 these and other issues you raise to outline a strawperson proposal for
 forward contracting,  rate stabilization and TRA undercollections.  As
 Ralph's email of Sunday evening observed,  if we manage to stay narrowly
 focused on these issues in the short-run we may have an opportunity to
 move the debate.
