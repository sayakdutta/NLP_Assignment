 Earlier this week, the Office of the Chairman announced that Kent Miller ha=
 s=20
 been elected a vice president of Enron.
 
 Kent is the first (of what I hope will be several) such promotion(s) under=
 =20
 Enron=01,s new Performance Review Committee (PRC) process.  He and the othe=
 r=20
 individuals selected for promotion to vice president and managing director=
 =20
 were elected based on their track records.
 
 In Kent=01,s case, he earned his appointment by demonstrating exceptional=
 =20
 leadership, innovation and excellent earnings performance in developing NNG=
 =01,s=20
 storage transactions, as well as in his other marketing responsibilities.
 
 This round of promotions is noteworthy because it is the first based solely=
 =20
 on outstanding accomplishments, rather than on the availability of open=20
 hierarchical positions.  As a result, while performance expectations contin=
 ue=20
 to increase, there will be far greater opportunity for advancement througho=
 ut=20
 the corporation.
 
 Please join me in congratulating Kent on this achievement.
