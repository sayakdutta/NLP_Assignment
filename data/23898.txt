 
 The last slide I'm working on is the "Detail of Market Value" slide.  I have a draft completed, but Steve has not been able to review it.  As long as I can get time with him in the morning and the changes aren't significant I should be able to have the presentation to you.
 
  
     
 Do you think I can the TW presentation on Wednesday by 12:00?
 
 
 Thanks
 
 Tracy
