 
 I'll take a look at it and run it by one of the other lawyers.
 
  
     
 
 
  
     
 
 Sara and Ellen,
 
 Attached below is a draft of the second amendment that we propose make to
 the ISDA Master Agreement dated as of February 1, 1994 between General Re
 Financial Products Corp. and Enron North America Corp.  The purpose of the
 amendment is to eliminate the break language from the ISDA Master that we
 added under the first amendment agreement.  Don Welstead in our Credit
 Department asked me to forward this to you in April, but I think that I
 failed to follow up on the assignment.
 
 Please review the draft and revert to me with any comments that you might
 have.  I can be reached at any time at Telephone: (212) 541-2561 /
 Facsimile: (212) 541-2549 or via return e-mail.
 
 Thanks a lot,
 Rene
