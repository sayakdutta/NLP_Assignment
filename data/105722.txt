 Your deadlines for the securities loan agreement for and related guaranties 
 are impossible to meet  (2/16/01 was last Friday).  The same agreement with 
 ENA has yet to be completed due to protracted negotiations.  
 
 Please advise as to who in credit approved the USD25million Enron Corp. 
 guaranty on behalf of ECI.  Also, FYI, Bear will not provide a reciprocal 
 guaranty for ENA.

 All,
 So that everyone can see what everone else is doing, below is the list of 
 steps of which I am aware.
 I think quite a few of these were completed in Houston on Friday.
 Please shout if:
 - I have missed anything
 - Any deadlines are unrealistic
 - Anybody else should be copied in
 etc
 
 Thanks,
 Richard
