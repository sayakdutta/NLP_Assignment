 Rhonna,
 
 Please arrange a meeting later this week for all of those addressed by this 
 message (Vince, it would great if one of your team could attend since we will 
 need some heavy statistical and analytical help to complete this project).
 
 The prupose of the meeting will be to discuss and delegate next steps 
 required to implement the HR Associate groups recommendations for the 
 development of an HR "value index" at Enron.
 
 I would anticipate we will need approx 45minutes.
 
 David
