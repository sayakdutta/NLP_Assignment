 a good networking opportunity.
 
 I'm off on Friday, too.  In fact, both Michael and I have strep throat and 
 spent the day at home.  I'll probably be in no more than 1/2 day tomorrow.  
 Is Norman still out of town?  Will you have the house ALL to yourself?

 Hi Kay,
 
 I just talked to Carlos.  They had their meeting today with the EES group, 
 and what can I say?  Since Carlos told me that you are his exclusive head 
 hunter, can I be the mingling coordinator?  Don't you think it might be nice 
 to have Carlos meet Stuart and some of the group, like for lunch or 
 something?  He is feeling sooooo lost.
 
 By the way, I think I am taking Friday off, okay?
