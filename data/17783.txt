 legislators; very easy to pass, etc.  However, it would be so complicated to 
 implement and is very likely in conflict with so many federal laws, that I 
 think they'll have an extremely difficult time pulling it off.  In addition, 
 the utilities (whose retained generation collected a big portion of the 
 "windfall" selling through the PX) would be subject to a big tax hit.  Would 
 that push them into bankruptcy?  In short, easy to pass politically, pretty 
 difficult to make stick legally.  This help?  
 
 You still have your PCG position?
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 How real is this and how much support is there behind this. Will it be 
 introduced today? When might it be voted on?
 
 Thanks,
