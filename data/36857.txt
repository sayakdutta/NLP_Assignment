 Osama  Goes To Hell
 One day in the future, Osama bin Laden has a heart attack and dies.  He immediately goes to hell, where the devil is waiting for him. 
 "I  don't know what to do here," says the devil. "You are on my list, but I have  no room for you. You definitely have to stay here, so I'll tell you what I'm  going to do. I've got a couple of folks here who weren't quite as bad as you.  I'll let one of them go, but you have to take their place. I'll even let YOU  decide who leaves." 
 Osama thought that sounded pretty good, so he  agreed. The devil opened the first room; in it was Richard Nixon and a large  pool of water. He kept diving in and surfacing empty handed -- over and over  and over. Such was his fate in hell. 
 "No," bin Laden said. "I don't  think so. I'm not a good swimmer and I don't think I could do that all day  long." 
 The devil led him to the next room; in it was Tony Blair with a  sledgehammer and a room full of rocks. All he did was swing that hamm! er,  time after time after time. 
 "No, I've got this problem with my  shoulder. I would be in constant agony if all I could do was break rocks all  day," commented Osama bin Laden. 
 The devil opened a third door. In it,  Osama saw Bill Clinton, lying on the floor with his arms staked over his head,  and his legs staked in a spread eagle pose. Bent over him was Monica Lewinsky,  doing what she does best. 
 Osama bin Laden looked at this in disbelief  for a while and finally said, "Yeah, I can handle this." 
 The devil  smiled and said, "OK, Monica, you're free to go."
