 Kathy,
 
 Cindy was contacted by the Greater Houston Partnership.  A New York-based financial company is considering relocating nearly 400 jobs to Houston due primarily to the influx of Enron talent to the market.  The Partnership has asked Cindy to present to this group tomorrow, Thursday, evening.  One piece of information they are asking for is a demographic breakdown of the people we terminated.  I was wondering if we could pull together numbers by job classification and level.  Here's what I invision:
 
 Number of Employees Let Go 		Total: 4,500
 
 	Trading				# 		(# Broken out by title/level)
 	Financial			#		(# Broken out by title/level)
 	Technical			#		(# Broken out by title/level)
 	Professional			#		(# By professions included)
 	Administrative			#		(# Broken out by level)
 	Other				#
 
 I'll put it into a PowerPoint slide for Cindy's presentation, but could I get the data (even if it is very rough) by about noon tomorrow?
 
 Kathy, I know how many unreasonable requests you've had to put up with over the past few months.  I hope that this isn't another one.  Forgive me and set me straight if this can't be done.
 
 Thank you,
 Terrie
