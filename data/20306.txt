 Hap:  Let's discuss further, but my reaction is that, while we don't need to--and shouldn't--actively and openly support John's letter, I don't believe that we should do anything to oppose, or prevent, John from releasing it.  Do you have particular concerns? I'll call you to discuss further.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
 
  
     
 Jeff,
 John White has proposed to the CEERT Board that we send the attached letter to the Governor attacking the DWR contracts. Would you please take a look at it and let me know what you think of it.  You can reach me on my cell phone at 213-359-0853. Thanks.
 Hap
 
 
  

   
  
 
 CEERT and Clean Power Campaign Directors - Attached is a revised version of
 the letter sent earlier this week regarding CDWR power contracts.  Please
 review and respond with comments as soon as possible.  A discussion of
 CEERT's plan of action will be scheduled shortly.
 
 Thank you,
