 being tracked. Even if you attempt to delete these tracks, Windows retains secret log files. Deleting Internet Caches and
 searching for history files would take hours of work manually. Clean Drive deletes all these items from your
 computer... automatically, as often as you like!

 records while you surf the web.
 
 No more worring about what people will see on your computer.
