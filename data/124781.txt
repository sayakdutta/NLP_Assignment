 Cindy,
 
 Please...remove me from your list.
 I am not involved with security, in Houston or otherwise, and can not help you obtain a security badge.

 Requesting your approval for activation of Security Badge#43604 for Paul Hannemann, Compaq contractor working directly with Rob Miller under the supervision of Mike Croucher and Frank Coles.
 
 He will require entry to the Ardmore facility and the EB34th floor, as Rob is training his as his replacement.
 
 Thank you
