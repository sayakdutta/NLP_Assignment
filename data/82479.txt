 
 Hope, Hope, Hope,
 
 The dress is gorgeous!!!!!!  But, hold up, you know you're forcing me to go to the Quick Weight Loss Center about 6 months before the wedding!!!!  Is that a shawl (I hope) and not a bow on the butt is it?  How much is the dress, my co-workers and I have a bet going.  (p.s. I'm not worried about the cost, I just want to look good!)
 
 What a terrific compliment from little miss Taylor, I'm certain Jordan will be thrilled.  That'll be so cute!  I'll ask him tonight and explain everything to him.  I'm sure when I mention Taylor, he'll go to grinning as well.  That boy is a mess!
 
 Talk to you soon!
 
 
 P.S. Please send a picture of the bridemaids dress as well, and what color!
 
 
 
  
     
 Hey Tricey!!!!!!!!!
 
 You are just the sweetest person ever. Here is a picture of your dress but
 the color of it will be champagne. I will have details later for you
 tonight at rehearsal. I hope that you like it :o)
 
 Also, Taylor has decided to be the miniature bride opposed to being a girl
 and she wants Jordan to walk with her. So, now I have another question :o)
 Do you think that Jordan would mind being the miniature groom? When we
 talked about it this morning Taylor was saying how she wanted him to walk
 with her and then she said, 'watch he's going to be so shy momma' with the
 biggest smile on her face.
 
 Love ya!
