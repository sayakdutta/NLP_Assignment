 Alan,
 
 Further to the last e-mail, I attach for your information a copy of trhe 
 Questionnaires which have been sent to our German and Spanish counsel.
 
 Obviously, I did not want to send a copy of this to Jeff Kinneman as I am 
 sure that he would not be interested in the Questionnaires - just the results 
 of them!!  Hence, this second e-mail.
 
 Kind regards
 
 Mark

 Mark,
 
 Many thanks for your message.  Re your reference to UK laws on Equity 
 Trading, I assume that you are referring to the proposed Equity Trading 
 facility in London;  I trust that  you also received my detailed e-mail on 
 that topic of yesterday evening.  Please note that I have now received a fax 
 from Alan Aronowitz with the Houston trading policy (containing Chinese Wall 
 information), to which I refer in that e-mail - I shall be considering the 
 sufficiency of that policy for UK purposes later today. 
 
 Re your request for advice on the extraterritorial effect of the U.S 
 securities' laws, this is a new question which we have been asked to look 
 at.  In my view, there will be some extraterritorial effect of such laws on 
 the activities.  I have also discussed this issue with Scott Sefton who has 
 provided me with a general overview on this, noting particularly the U.S. 
 Insider Dealing laws and potential U.S. reporting and disclosure of 
 interests' requirements; however, Scott has suggested that we retain external 
 U.S. counsel for in-depth advice on this, with which I agree.
 
 If you agree that we should instruct external counsel on this issue, I would 
 be more than happy to deal with this from London;  please let me now which 
 external counsel you would wish to use.  In my and Scott's views, we should 
 use expert  "SEC"-knowledgeable counsel in New York, such as either Cravath, 
 Cadwallader, Davis Polk, Cleary's, etc.
 
 Please just let me know - I would be able to instruct external counsel today, 
 get an estimate of their time for dealing with the US aspect and report back 
 immediately.        
 
 Kind regards

 Mark:  We also need to look at the UK laws regarding equity trading and what 
 the extraterritiorial reach is of the US sec;urities laws.  Please  copy Mark 
 Taylor on this matter as well.  Please give me a time frame on when we will 
 have answers to these questions.  Thanks.  Mark Haedicke
