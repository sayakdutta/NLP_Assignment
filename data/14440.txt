 
 Yes Thank You -  The Home Study arrived yesterday in the mail and I'm shipping it off to the INS today.
  
 I just go back in town last night from a business trip and am anxious to Liz today.
 
 
     
 
 Shelley,
  
 Did you get the home study yet?  It should have arrived by now.  
  
 Also were you able to email Liz?  I am still looking for her phone number.  I will email it if I find it.
