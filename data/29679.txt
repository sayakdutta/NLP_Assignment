 Jose - I am not going to include this in the "presentation" -  it is a bit to 
 detailed - I will make several copies of it - and when the question comes up 
 - you tell me which pages you want to talk from - if nothing comes up - I 
 will leave the presentation with Rebecca and Jim for their later review.
