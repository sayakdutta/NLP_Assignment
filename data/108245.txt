 continue to meet as many people as possible in the organization.  Jeff

 Jeff,
 I have talked to Geoff Storey and he told me that rotating early should not 
 be a problem. I will also talk to Hunter asap. Thank you for offering to talk 
 to Steve Horn; I would greatly appreciate it. I will meet with him on Friday 
 morning. 
 Could I also ask you for your general opinion on this rotation  and whether 
 you see it as a good experience?
 
 Thanks for everything
 Massimo
