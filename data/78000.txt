 
 Hi guys,
 
 I suggest a brief meeting to discuss strategy before anything is sent to SW.

 Mitch, no problem here.  Pete/Chris, along with Ross will handle outstanding 
 warranty issues.  Pete,Chris please submit your warranty items to Ross, Ross 
 please work with Gavin to ensure that EE&CC's meshes with ours.
 
 Thanks
 
 Tom
 
 

 
  
 Kay -
 
 As part of the contract implementation, we need to authorize the plant 
 managers at Gleason and Wheatland to execute warranty issues with 
 Westinghouse.  I've taken a first stab.  Please review from a legal 
 perspective and change as necessary.  Note that there are 3 total contracts, 
 two for Gleason and one for Wheatland.
 
 Gavin, please provide contact names and addresses to Kay for the Westinghouse 
 section.  Please also provide the contract numbers.
 
 Pete & Chris, my intention is to empower you to be able to talk directly with 
 SW on warranty issues.  Obviously, the terms of the O&M contract and common 
 sense should dictate when you cut in the owner (me). Additionally, OEC's 
 internal procedures and methods will dictate when you cut in your chain of 
 command.  Performance test issues, MW limiter issues, etc will be coordinated 
 by Houston since they involve deeper commercial issues.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Mitch
