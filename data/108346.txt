 1.  Brent-Dubai calendar swap differential.  Idea would be to trade this 
 differential on a quarterly basis.
 2.  WTI-Brent calendar swap differential.  Same timing idea, Nymex v IPE..
 3.  WTI-Dated Brent calendar swap differential.  Nymex v Platts Dated Brent.
 4.  WTI-Brent  futures differential.  Issue would be settlement dates given 
 the time lag between expiry.
