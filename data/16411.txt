 
 Here are some suggestions for the op-ed piece.  One general comment:  It may 
 be a bit lengthy at this point.  Also, have we decided whether it would be 
 our op-ed piece?  
 
 And one key point that is very commercially sensitive:  The term "end the 
 rate freeze" has very ominous implications for EES's book, depending on the 
 timing of any such "end" in California.  Thus my heavy-handed edits on that 
 portion.
 
 Nice job, Jeannie.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
