 ever looked like that, tho...!

  Don't you think this is what Frank must have looked like as a
 kitten?
 
 
     
 
 Every time I see a picture like this, I'm more ready to bring one of these
 critters home, but I am sure J & L would put me out and change the locks,
 too.
 
 Do I have cat duty this month when you head to the wine country?
