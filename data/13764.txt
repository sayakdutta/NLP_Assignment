 Ben:
 
 As we discussed, the regulations from the department of labor specifically
 allow the employment of 14 to 16 year olds in non-hazardous employment.  The
 regulations, however, restrict employment to 40 hours in a week, 8 hours in
 a day, and between the hours of 7:00 am to 9:00 pm.  29 C.F.R. 570.35.
 Thus, don't take the interns to a power plant and don't work them past 9:00
 or the hours indicated and you should be ok.  Let me know if you have any
 follow up questions.
