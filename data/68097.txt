 FYI - this is set up and has been added as a tab to the bankruptcy post id sheet(CAN).  If you open the attachment, you will see she set these up as MMBTU/USD books in Risktrac.  I talked with Cecilia and she has changed this in ERMS/TAGG effective today to be GJ/CAD.  Not sure how this happened, but it is fixed now.  Should not have any problems, there is nothing in this book currently.  Let me know if we need to calc these when I get back on Wednesday.

 Bernice - please set up the attached book request and notify when complete.
 
 Francis/Cecilia - I will be out of the office Thursday and Friday (Dec 20 and 21).  Please handle the Erms side once Bernice sends out the notification.
 
 I have already set up these books in RisktRAC.
 
 Due to the Outlook problems, I was unable to handle this request in a timely fashion.  Sorry for any delays this may have caused.
 
 Thanks everyone and have a happy and safe holiday!
