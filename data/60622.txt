 
 we are struggling through we have elp from a lady Loretta.  Please help Dave tomorrow (if you are well enough to come back)
 
  
     
 Yes I will do that right now.
 
 Oh my goodness-I can't believe that about Tina.  She was complaining on
 Friday about a pain she was having in her chest and I told her she better
 get that looked at.  When I get into the office tomorrow I will grant me
 access to Dave's calendar and take care of him.  Is he doing okay today?
