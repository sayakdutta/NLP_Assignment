 Jeff Burns, Kevin Stangeland, Chris Hartman, Rueben Schug and some other guys 
 are coming down and staying the night but i don't think we will have time to 
 stop by before the game.  I know I would like to come by the house and see 
 how things are doing and I am sure those guys would to so let me know if you 
 guys have anything going on Saturday night.
