 Ed-
 
 Please see attached changes to the LOC Formats proposed by Enron.  I have
 revised the draw language and expiration date language to reflect the
 changes we agreed to last week.
 
 In addition, I have inserted a paragraph at the end of the LOC form to
 reflect a change requested by the bank.  It relates to the ability to
 transfer the LOC.  Also attached is the form of transfer statement that the
 bank will require if Enron chooses to transfer the LOC to another party.
 It looks relatively straight forward and I believe it should be acceptable
 to you.
 
 Please review these changes and if acceptable, we can proceed with
 execution of the documents.
