 
 .After some period of orientation and adjustment(6 months?) all attorneys: 
 senior counsel, assistant general counsel, and vice-president are expected to 
 be independant. We don't have the time or the inclination to hold hands. 
 There is no "standard" promotion track. If a senior counsel is successful, a 
 promotion to asst. gen. counsel  will happen in1-3 years A promotion to VP is 
 the closest thing we have to "making Partner" and generally takes 2-5 years. 
 There is not that much compensation difference between a SC and a AGC.
