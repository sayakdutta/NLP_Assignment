 
 Two of you had to leave the staff meeting before this final discussion point 
 and three of you were not in attendance, so I wanted to send you the attached 
 memo that I distributed at the end of the meeting.  This memo will be sent by 
 Rick Causey via notes mail regarding an additional role that I will assume 
 with regard to global operations.  I shared this in the staff meeting so that 
 you would be the first to know.  I will still fulfill my role within ENA as 
 VP of Energy Operations.  I will not be going away!  This expanded 
 responsibility should create addtional opportunities for operations personnel 
 and will validate some of the global functions that we already provide to the 
 organization.
