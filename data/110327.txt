 not back before the weekend.  Utah was great!  Tons of fresh powder and good
 weather.  Are you in town this weekend?

 Once again, I was out when you sent me mail.  I went to NYC for a long
 weekend.  Had a great time, but I'm still exhausted.  Hope you're having a
 great time in Utah.  If you get back before the weekend, drop me an email.

 Hey Mat- hope you enjoyed your time off.  I'm heading to Utah for some
 skiing next week for a little break myself.  Anything going on tonight?

 Hey Anna,
 
 Sorry, I took awhile getting back to you....I took the week off...
 
 Ya, we tried meeting up, but I guess you guys must have left before we got
 there.  Our dinner at Sambuca's took quite awhile, I think we made it to
 Deans around 12:30 or so.  We checked there and the Hub, but no luck.  Hope
 you guys had a good time, and I'm always up for another night out.

 Matt- I don't know if you remember me, but we met at Jennifer's party at
 the
 Black Lab.  Thought we were meeting up with y'all last Sat, night, but I
 guess we missed each other.  Maybe we can try it again sometime soon.  Hope
 you had a fun night without us :)

 Hello!  OK, for those of you who can make it (and I hope it will be all of

 Prairie) at 7:30 PM.  So, if you can make it to dinner, please come at 7:30
 and we will reserve a big table.  If you can't make it to dinner, come to
 El Tiempo for a margarita and then we will head over to Dean's after that.
 Hope to see you all there!  And please feel free to invite others!  JB
