 conferences and would therefore propose not to include them in the value
 proposition at this time.
 
 Although I liked the idea of the levels being tied to energy, I don't like
 the titles.  I would like to see some additional options.  I will also put
 some thinking into alternatives.

 Included is a draft of a proposed fee structure arrangement for the
 "partnership membership" in GEMI.  Rather than focusing on discounts and
 credits for the certificate fees, we thought the simpler concept would be to
 
 have a certain number of slots provided at no charge for the different
 membership levels. We have tried to allow maximum participation in the
 seminars and forums but providing a pro-rationing mechanism if needed.   On
 conferences, we have suggested discounts which grow in size depending on the
 
 membership level. It would be helpful if you could respond by Dec. 15th if
 you like the proposal or have any suggestions.Thanks for taking the time to
 review.
