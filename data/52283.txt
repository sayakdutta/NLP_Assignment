 
 Traci,
 
 I have visited Georgia Tech on Thursday.
 One of the students indicated that he is
 interested in a summer internship.
 He came across as a very bright person,
 very personable.
 
 I can take him as a summer intern.

 Dear Dr. Vincent Kaminski,
 
 Hi. How are you doing? I hope you have a good flight back to home.
 It was a good opportunity to know about Enron and its finance sector.
 Thank you for your time.
 
 I have already submitted my resume and cover letter right after the talk.
 However, you ask me to send a copy of resume and cover letter again. Those
 attachments are what I was asked. Again, it was a good chance for me to
 get to know what I can do in this field and what I have to more focus on
 in school.
 
 I am looking forward to hearing from you soon and have a nice day.
 Thank you.
