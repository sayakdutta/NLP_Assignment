 
 Brooklyn,
 
 What's going on?  How was your holiday?  I thought about you this weekend.  
 We had fried turkey.  It was sooo yummy.  I was going to bring you some, but 
 there weren't even crums left.  
 
 Well, I just wanted to brag.  So I'll leave you alone.
 
 By the way, how was your trip to Kinder?  Did you have trouble finding the 
 hotel or resturant?
 
 Later,
 Robin
