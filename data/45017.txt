 
 Attached is a unilateral form of Confidentiality Agreement where Counterparty 
 is the protected party.  This form needs a little tweaking since it is more 
 directed for a financing transaction.  Peter can find it, as well as other 
 forms, in the attorney forms bank.  Call me, or have Peter call me, if I can 
 be of further help.
