 I will be out of town all of next week (sorry I will not be able to play) but will try to mail you the results and league fee early next week on the one day I am back.  Tonight, all of the lines except line 4 won.  Thanks and talk to you soon.

 This is a reminder that you still owe me the league fee of $18.  You can
 
 either pay me cash or check.  If you want...you can mail it to me at:
