 Hi Michelle
 
 Please let us know when we may expect to receive a copy of the duly executed 
 Secondment Agreement for our file.
 
 Regards
 Angeline

 Hi Michelle
 
 We have now finalised the Secondment Agreement with Kim & Chang, and the soft 
 copy is attached for your further action.   Please let us have a fully 
 executed copy for our file thereafter.
 
 
 
 
 Thanks and regards
 Angeline

 Matt,
 
 I am aware that an agreement was contemplated.  I did not prepare one, 
 however.  I worked only on the employment agreement.  You might check with 
 Sharon Butcher to see whether she has one.
 
 If we need to put one in place, it can be done rather easily.
 
 Michelle

 Dear Michelle and Fran
 
 I understand from my file and from speaking with Anita Fam that you were to 
 have a Secondment Agreement for Mr JG Hong and Ms Kim JA put in place between 
 Enron Overseas Services Corp ("EOSC" previously known as "OPC Ltd") and Enron 
 Capital & Trade Resources Korea Corp. ("ECTRKC", a Delaware corporation). 
 This dates back to on or about January 1999, but I don't have a copy of the 
 executed Secondment Agreement on file. Please let me have a copy as we may 
 potentially have to present a copy to the Korean tax authorities as evidence 
 of Mr JG Hong and Ms Kim JA's employment/secondment structure.
 
 There are some tax related issues that have arisen in Enron Korea that I'm 
 assisting Lim Tiong Hock to resolve and your early response would be most 
 appreciated.
 
 Thanks and regards
 
 Matt
