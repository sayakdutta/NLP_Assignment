 
 Ann,
 
 	Attached is the final, ready-to-file Answer of Transwestern Pipeline Company to Protests. I believe we have confirmed that this can be filed electronically today. If this is not the case, please let Steve and me know so that we can have it filed manually. Also, will we receive any confirmation of receipt of the electronic filing from FERC? Thanks.
