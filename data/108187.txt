 Dear Jeff:
 
 This is to inform you that the following subscriptions are up for renewal:
 
 Forbes
 Futures/The Magazine of Commodities & Options
 Gas Utility Report
 Harvard Business Review
 Inside Ferc
 
 In the past, such renewals were routed to Info Central to be paid.  Our 
 department has changed its focus to research.
 If you would like to renew as a courtesy, we would be happy to take care of 
 this for you.  We will contact the publisher and let them know that for the 
 next renewal to send the invoice directly to you, and from then on, you would 
 take care of payment.
 Please let me know if you would like to renew this publication, as it will 
 expire shortly.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Susan Kennedy
 713/853-9135
