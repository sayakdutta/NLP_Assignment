 Jeff, Mark:
 
 Wondering where you were yesterday. Hope you didn't
 forget about the in-class quiz! 
 
 The next HW and writeup due next week seems like 
 a heavy one. 
 Do most of you have Monday off? I'll take a look at the
 case/HW Sa/Su, and prefer a meeting / conf call anytime
 Monday. Perhaps PM in the city if folks are working 
 that day? Sunday PM (after 7) works for me too.
