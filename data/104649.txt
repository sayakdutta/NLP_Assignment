 arranged.  Wednesday would work best.  Can you talk to Carson?  Sara

 Carson,
 I've been out of town on business a lot lately.  I'd love to have dinner again
 and I've heard great things about Benji's.
 Sara has a "special"  birthday coming up on the 17th.  I don't know any of her
 friends here since she's gotten out of the
 business in Houston.  Wouldn't it be great if you could get her two "birthday
 pals" together with us for the occasion!?  Isn't
 Monty a mutual friend of yours?  (I've never met him.)  What do you think?

 Hi Donna:
 
 I have not heard from you in a while, so I wanted to touch base. No real
 news here. I had a nice lunch with Paul Dunning this week. He is still
 very busy and recovering from a back injury but in good spirits as
 usual. I still want to go to Benji's one evening if you are available.
 
 Take Care,
 Carson
