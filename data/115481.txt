 
 Questions about this deal - 
 
 1. Should energy type be CAISO? 
 2. Should trade date be 3/7?
 3. Should confirmation status be "NO"?
 
 I believe the answer to all of these is yes, but I wanted to check before 
 changing anything. The confirms group is getting extra sensitive about deals 
 marked for confirmation, since they are now confirming all daily deals. Just 
 a reminder to double-check your default settings and your deals for the 
 confirmation status.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate
