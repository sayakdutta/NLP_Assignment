 
 Have we made this available to the Cheney team?
 
 


  
  
 Here's the Opinion Elite file.  It looks very strong for our open access 
 argument.
 
 Suggest we update the WH.  Any other uses?  I have the verbatims and cross 
 tabs.  We'll send a sanitized version (although there's not much I wouldn't 
 want everybody to see) to some of the interviewees who requested it.
