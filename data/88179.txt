 
 I have determined the GISBs referred to earlier were acquired by ENA through 
 Columbia Energy Services.  I will be faxing those to you soon.  They are 
 executed but in the name of 
 CES.   Regarding those agreements, we have Consent Agreements for assignment 
 from MarkWest.
 
 Concerning the Master Sale Spot Agreement dated 5-1-90,  I have located same 
 and will send you a fax of it as well.
 
 I agree, with your suggestion to terminate the previous agreements and we can 
 begin with a new GISB.   I have not yet determined , do you know if there are 
 any trades booked under any of these contracts?   If so, we can move them to 
 the new agreement,
