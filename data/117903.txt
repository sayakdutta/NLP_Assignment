 I have no idea how any of my time would have been charged to an Africa 
 project.  Of course, I have no idea how any of my time gets charged to any 
 project so my ignorance shouldn't be used as a guide.  In any event, if it is 
 my time, it is clearly there in error.  Is there any detail describing what I 
 am supposed to have done during those hours?  That might help me redirect the 
 errant time to  where it belongs.  There used to be another Mark E. Taylor at 
 Enron.  He worked for EI and was based in London.  Any chance this is his 
 time?

 Mark,
 
 In April 1999 we're showing that you charged 184 hours to J3025 Benin (Sean 
 Long).  Did you work on this project or any other Africa projects, e.g. for 
 Tony Way, during this time period?
 
 Basically, we are evaluating whether some employees may have accidentally 
 charged to Sean's projects, whereas they meant to charge to Tony's.
 
 Thanks, Mark!

 I don't know why any of my time would be charged in this way. Maybe if you 
 can give me a little more detail I could help.

 I would appreciate your comments.  We are reviewing costs following the 
 Africa reorg, and in preparation for the QBR.
 
 Thanks!

 April payroll records show that you charged time to J3025 - Benin (Africa - 
 Sean Long's Group).  Would you please confirm whether this is the correct 
 project?  If these hours need to be moved to another project, we can make the 
 transfer if you provide us with the project code.
 
 Thank you,
 Ken
