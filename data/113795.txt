 I imagine 6-10 pages in reporting requirements for Gas Daily Options and Pipe Options alone. 
 
 While we are still working on these requirements we can move forward on 1-3 and the deal entry and new deal type 
 for basis options.

 I take it this is not your final document?
 
    
  
 Attached please find the Inception Document for Gas Trading Vision II Phase II. I would appreciate your comments. I will be circulating the document for signatures on Wednesday. Please provide your inputs by then.
 
 Thanks
