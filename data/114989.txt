 
 Okay, I know for a fact that Natsource has been yelled at by our traders at 
 least once today. NONE of these deals should have broker fees on them. Here's 
 the deal....
 
 488121 - no fee
 488122 - other side of spread - FEE
 
 495306 - no fee GUARANTEED, says Tom Alonso
 
 495206 - no fee
 495207 - other side of spread - FEE
 
 If they still dispute, let me know and I'll sick the traders on them. Sorry 
 for the hassle.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate
