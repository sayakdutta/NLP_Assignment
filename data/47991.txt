 Cross Timbers Oil Company has requested that we consolidate our entire 
 trading relationship at the above referenced entity.  They have also asked 
 that we consider a netting agreement for margining purposes that will allow 
 netting of not only financial and physical mark to market, but receivables 
 and payables with the combined mark to market. They have offered a parent 
 guaranty from Cross Timbers Oil Company to cover existing exposure with a 
 built-in cushion to cover future transactions.
 
 As I see it, there are several credit and legal issues within their request.  
 First, is credit comfortable wearing the aggregate amount of exposure, and 
 does an enormous guaranty from a BB- company get us there?  If so, is legal 
 comfortable with the concept (as in Torch Energy Marketing's case) of an 
 overall netting agreement across products, receivables, payables, and mark to 
 market?  Finally, are we comfortable transacting with the entity that has no 
 assets, but rather is simply backed by a guaranty.  
 
 If we do figure out that we can accommodate their request, we will need to 
 assign the master agreements and all transactions under the agreements from 
 Cross Timbers Oil Company to Cross Timbers Energy Services, Inc.  We will 
 also need to amend the outstanding guaranty, extend its tenure and increase 
 its amount.  
 
 I will address the credit issues within our group, and I think we should try 
 to schedule a meeting between legal and credit to discuss whether or not the 
 netting agreement requested is possible.  I will make a call up to legal 
 later this morning to compare schedules and try to set up a time to meet.  
 Meanwhile, please call me with any questions, concerns or suggestions.
 
 Regards,
 
 John
