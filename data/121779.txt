 
 How about we meet you at the Met.  Lindy and I will be in the 3AC until lunch.  Meet you there at 11:30.

 Thanks, Kim.
 
  
     
 Can we meet downstairs at 11:30 & walk over to the Met.  That will ensure that we are all back at 1:00
 
  
     
 You bet!  Can we meet at 11:20 or 11:30?  I would like to be back for a 1:00 pm meeting.  Have you been to Daily Review Cafe lately?  It is just outside of Downtown off of Dallas St.  I would be happy to drive.
 
 Thanks, Kim.
