 
 Thanks!  I'll get Lavo's title changed.  I spoke to our buddy in London this 
 morning.  He seems to be doing wonderful, as usual.  He and Sue are getting 
 ready to buy a new house in Twickenham, four bedrooms, garage (so he can park 
 his new convertible home instead of across town) on the river.  It sounds 
 really nice.  He has been traveling alot.  Weddings almost every weekend for 
 months.  Rowing.  That about sums it up.
 
 I ran into Gaffer for the 1st time in months.  By his traveling schedule, I 
 think we've really hired him to be a door to door salesman.
 
 I heard the Mounties have arrived for you.  Your new lawyer has started.  
 Congrats!
