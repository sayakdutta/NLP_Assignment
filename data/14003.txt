 
 I do not have any of this information -- Cathy, is the Metals plan the same as Enron domestic?  If so, then I would suggest that Chris Rahaim participate in this process.  Feel free to work with me on it, but I just don't have any data.  Thanks.  Michelle

 Michelle:
 
 Further to Cynthia's message below--I am principally looking for two items:
 
 1.  pension and benefit information for Enron Metals US; and
 2.  pension and benefits case law, Pension and Benefits Guaranty Corporation
 opinions and    Department of Labor Opinions (in reference to the Henry Bath
 US entities).
 
 Any assistance you could provide would be much appreciated.
 
 Best regards.

 Michelle, Deborah Greenwood needs to speak with someone for labor issues
 for diligence purposes related to the US Metals transaction.  From what
 I can tell, she needs info for Reps and Warr.
 
 Mikie, please send a pdf file to Deborah of the Benefits at a Glance or
 the SPD which ever is quickest.
 
 Thanks
