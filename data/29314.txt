 
 Thanks Craig!  I'll look forward to seeing your smilin' face more 
 frequently!  [Actually that will be tough since I currently see it at least 
 twice a day on a life size billboard in the Omaha office lobby!!]  df 
 
 
    
  
 
 WAY TO GO DREW!!!
 
 It's really refreshing to see someone who works hard (and works smart) get 
 recognized.  Well done...
 Congratulations,
 
 Craig Buehler
 
 
 Michael Moran, currently Managing Director and General Counsel for ETS, has 
 decided to retire after a distinguished 27-year career with Enron.   Mike has 
 been a conscience and a statesman of our organization and it is hard for me 
 to imagine the ETS organization without Mike.  
  
 Fortunately, Drew Fossum, currently Vice President and General Counsel for 
 Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern, has accepted my offer to become Vice 
 President and General Counsel of ETS effective April 1, 2001.  Drew will 
 relocate to Houston and report to me in his new role.
  
 To assist with transition issues and special projects, Mike has agreed to 
 stay on board for several months as Managing Director and Special Counsel to 
 the Chairman and will continue to report to me.   
  
 Please join me in congratulating Drew on his new assignment and thanking Mike 
 for his many contributions to ETS and Enron.
