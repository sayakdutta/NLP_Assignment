 
 Mark:  Did you have wind of Jason's story on Edison calling for an end to AB 
 1890?  His spin on the story was good one---Edison got everything it wanted 
 (out of 1890) and now it wants out of the contract.
 
 The story seems worthy of a response, particularly since Jason's the 
 reporter.  Even the Chair of FERC recognizes that going backwards is not the 
 answer.
 
 Best,
