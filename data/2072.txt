 Hi John,
 
 I work in Corp. PR and Eric Thode recommended that I drop you and email with 
 respect to a question I have about specific trade types that no one seems to 
 know the answer to.  I wanted to know if you knew what ST and MLT trades are 
 and just so you know, in case it makes a difference, these are in context to 
 French power trading.  I know you are extremely busy but if you get a chance 
 I would greatly appreciate your comments.  
 
 Thanks, Ann
