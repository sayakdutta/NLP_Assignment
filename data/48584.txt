 Do you have an ETA on when this customer will be blessed?

 This is ok.  I have changed the profile, but Legal and Contracts need to look at it before it goes through.

 Any decision on this customer's request?
 
  
     
 Wendi/Tom,
 
 Below is customer's email:
 
 Aquila Broadband Services (ABS) is requesting that you please reauthorize
 our ability to execute broadband trades with Enron.  We currently have the
 ability to view the markets with our user ID, but we would like the access
 to transact with Enron from both the bid and offer side.
 
 Please let me know your decision.
 
 Thanks,
 Griff
