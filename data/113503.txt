 Please see the attached preliminary outline that contains milestones achieved so far and future activities in the California Refund proceeding.  With more time, we will flesh this out to provide additional detail.  Thanks,  Ray

 Bob & Ray --
 
 Can each of you please put together a short outline of the (a) timeline, (b) key decision points, and (c) potential outcomes of the decision points for the different refund cases?
 
 If possible, having this before today's call would be helpful (but I realize that this may be difficult).
 
 Jim
