 Don,
 
 As a result of our review of the information and documents on Lincoln we
 are requesting additional documents which are not in the data room.
 
 1.   Relating to the plant's PSD:
 
      The Mostardi & Platt emissions test protocol for the May 2000
      emissions test
       A report to Illlinois EPA containing the emission test data
      Continuous Emission Monitoring (" CEM") Data ( all data
      developed since start-up)
      Any reports to IEPA required under the permit pertaining to
      exceedances, or
      start-up, breakdown & malfunction ( we have internal memos indicating
      that there
      was a breakdown at # 7 on July 5,2000)
 
 2. Also, we don't have any permits for wastewater discharge. We have been
 told that there is no wastewater discharged except
 sewage/office wastewater which is going to a septic field. But we have no
 verification of this at this point.
 
 Thank you for your attention to these items.
