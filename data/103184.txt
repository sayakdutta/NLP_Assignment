 Sara,
 

 the status of the draft ISDA Master Agreement.  As you may recall, on 
 February 3rd, I prepared a draft for your review.  I beleive this draft was 
 nto sent to the counterparty due to some thoughts you had concerning our IOU 
 provisions.  Steve is eager to recieve the draft if such matters have been 
 resolved.
 
 Let me know if I may be of further assistance.
 
 Susan
