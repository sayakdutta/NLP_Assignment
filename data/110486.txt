 
 Tom,
 
 Thanks for the new version.  I finally got the other version to work, but 
 only by running it on Ken's computer.  I have some questions regarding the 
 summary sheet, and I plan on spending a significant amount of time with the 
 model this weekend....so yes, let's meet tomorrow if possible.  I'm free 
 anytime except between 9:30 am and noon.  Just name the time and place.  I 
 also need to get familiar with the model used in Chicago for the real time 
 decision making.  Speak to you soon.
