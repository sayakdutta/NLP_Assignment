 Go with Vintage's numbers on the spreadsheet.  I have corrected the sitara ticket.  I think the problem might have been that I forgot to adjust the fuel value from the previous month.  Sorry for the mistake.
 
 Thanks,

 Hi Susan,
 
 I got a call form Vintage Gas and they are disputing the T-port rate on KOCH P/L for July production.
 Attached are the rates confirmed by the customer:

 Please review and advise.
