 the files, but I do need them printed so that the footer appears with the 
 name as opposed to the temp file number.
 
 Thanks!

 I told them to bring the originals back to you because I thought you needed 
 them.  Do you have them so I can come get them and do this for you.

 Suz,
 
 Please print four sets of originals of each of the documents you faxed this 
 am (name in footers).  
 
 Thanks,
