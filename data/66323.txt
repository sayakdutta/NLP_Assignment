 
 i think that all they do is bark and freak out.  they aren't good dogs.  they aren't friendly.  and i am not angry.
 
  
     
 you don't have to get angry about it.  i do know what a cockerspaniel is, i
 just don't like them.   i used to, but not since i saw melissa's.  you still
 haven't given any good reasons why you don't like chihuahuas.  i think you
 really like them but are embarrassed to admit it.
 
 
     
 
 look, damn it, they have all the personality in the world and they are not
 that big.  i don't think you know what a cockerspaniel is.

    well, i am not getting a cockerspaniel, they are too big, and all of the
    ones i have been around are boring.  no personality.
 
    
                 
 
    yeah i had one.   her name was mandy and she was the sweetest dog and my
    dad has one currently and the dog isnt retarded.  all dogs are dumb.
    they
    are called dumb friends b/c they don't speak.

       that was mean.  did you really used to have one?  my friend melissa
    has
       one
       and it is the dumbest dog i have ever seen.
 
       
                             
 
       your retarded.  i used to have one.  they are great dogs.

          cockerspaniels are retarded.  why do you think i should get one of
          those?
 
          
                                         
 
          i think they are all bark and no bite.  i think they could get
    their
          asses
          kicked by cats.  they look like they were doberman pinchers who
    were
          shrunk.  you should get a cockerspaniel.

             no, i am not kidding and no i don't want it b/c of the taco
    bell
       dog.
          i
             want it b/c it is really small and cute.  i knew someone in
       college
          who
             had
             one and i loved it.  why do you think they are mean?
 
             

                                        
 
             are you kidding?  why would you want a chihuahua?  those dogs
       aren't
             even
             friendly.  do you think they are cool b/c of the taco bell dog?

                what's a furry dog?  i have to get a small dog b/c my apt.
    is
          small.
             i
                want
                a chihuahua.   they aren't furry and they have personality.
 
                

                                                 
 
                it depends what type you get.  if you get one of those
    little
          furry
             dogs
                that you can carry with you everywhere, then i can't like
    that
          dog.
             if
                you
                get one with personality like a bulldog it can stay at my
       place.
             those
                little furry dogs act like cats.

                   no!  you are so mean.  why would you ever want to kick a
          precious
                little
                   puppy?
 
                   

                                                          
 
                   only if i have a bad day.  if i have a bad day will you
    let
       me
             come
                over
                   and kick it?
