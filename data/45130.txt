  Tan and Susan - can one of you handle this?  I called Diane Anderson and 
 told her that I'll be leaving Enron and won't be able to help her.  I told 
 her I would foreward the email on to you.   Thanks!

 Susan,
 
 I am working with Joe Hunter to prepare the individual letters to our 
 counterparties
 for the below detailed project.   In order to fill in the blanks in the first 
 paragraph
 of Carol's template, it is necessary for me to know the appropriate section 
 in 
 each counterparty's Agreement that references the existing confirmation 
 procedures 
 (the "Confirmation Procedures").
 
 Would it be possible for you to provide me with copies of the Master 
 Agreements
 for each of the following counterparties, so I can fill in the blanks and get 
 these letters
 out the door:
 
 Bank One (formerly FNB)
 Bankers Trust Company
 Barclays Bank PLC
 The Chase Manhattan Bank
 Citibank, N.A.
 Credit Suisse Financial Products
 Elf Trading S.A
 J.Aron & Company
 Paribas
 Phibro Inc.
 Royal Bank of Canada
 
 I would be happy to come up and retrieve them as soon as you have them ready.
 If you have any questions, please give me ( 3-0443) or Joe ( 3-3316) a call.
 
 Thanks - we're looking forward to being able to implement this procedure.
 -Diane

 Joe Hunter has asked me to draft a form of confirmation reply letter that we 
 could send to our counterparties in lieu of signing their confirmations.  
 This form of letter with the appropriate chnages could also be used by those 
 counterparties that we confirm.  Please let me know if you have any comments 
 on this form or any concerns about implementing this process.  Thanks.
 Carol
