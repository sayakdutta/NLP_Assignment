 
 I definitely want to renew, but as you know I never get home before the 
 leasing office closes.  I've got paintball Saturday morning but I know that 
 won't take all day so maybe I can go by in the afternoon to sign any 
 necessary papers.  My guess is you'll need to sign some papers as well.
 
 
 
    
 Sue,
 
 We had a message from the apt. office about renewing our lease. If we renew 
 we can get our carpet cleaned for free, I THINK?  Let me know if you need me 
 to do anything.  They have been sending you the renewal notices and leaving 
 you the messages, so I am not sure if you need to instigate it.
 
 let me know
