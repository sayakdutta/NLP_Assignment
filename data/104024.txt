 Sara,
 
 I am working with Jeff Kabel in the Buenos Aires Office, pitching our risk 
 management capabilities. We are focusing on the Power market and the Liquids 
 market in BA. 
 In this regard we have contacted Perez Companc, active both in Oil trading 
 and Power Generation, and as a result we have a possibility of structuring 
 some options on power with them.
 I will like to ask you which is our situation as regards ISDA documentation 
 with Perez. Do we have one signed with them ? What needs to be done to have 
 it ?
 
 I have received from them a copy of the credit support and schedule and will 
 forward it to you.
 
 Regards,
 
 Bernardo
