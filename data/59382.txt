 Kam,
 
 I found the following comment in Global Counterparty regarding the suspension of TXU Energy Trading Company (CP ID 69034):
 
  
 
 Cheryl Johnson in the GCP group suspended this record due to the merger which resulted in the final name of TXU Energy Trading Company LP.  It sounds like deals need to be moved over to the new CP name.  You will need to coordinate that with Cheryl because she will have to re-activate the CP ID to do that.
 
 Please let me know if you have any further questions.
 
 Thanks,
