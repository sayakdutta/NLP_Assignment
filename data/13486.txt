 
 We are in the process of promulgating a data protection policy.  It should be 
 out  in the next few weeks.  It addresses all of those privacy, etc. issues.  
 Let me know if you would like a copy of the draft policy.  MIchelle

 This has been looked at by our HR IT department for many years as we have 
 been transmitting data back and forth in our Compensation and HR systems.  I 
 am copying Sherry Lessner who at one time lead the group dealing with this 
 issue, as well as Sharon Butcher and Michelle Cash from our legal department.
 
 Ladies, can you provide any additional information on what we are doing?  Do 
 we need additional research in this area?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Jane

 Jane:
 
 I participated in a lunch yesterday on Capitol Hill which discussed the 
 recently concluded bilateral negotiations between Europe and the US on the 
 issue of data privacy/safe harbor.  I admit that I don't fully understand the 
 issue, but in essence I'm told it's an internal EU directive passed a few 
 years ago (not all countries within the EU have come into compliance yet, by 
 the way) that has strict bearing on issues pertaining to the protection of 
 the privacy of transmitted data (eg, over the internet).   The EU wants to 
 forbid transmitting certain types of data to countries that don't "adequately 
 protect" the information.  As always, the EU wants to regulate the issue, 
 while the US prefers self-regulation.  After two years of negotations, they 
 agreed a few weeks ago that data transmitted from the EU to the US could be 
 put in "safe harbors", which are basically approved bodies that would check 
 the recipient's ability to protect the privacy of the information, ie, an 
 American company receiving privelaged data from its European affiliates or 
 offices.  
 
 How does this affect Enron?  A couple of other company reps said it is 
 especially pertinent to HR issues, such as transmitting personnel 
 information, salary, etc. from Europe back to the home office in the US.
 
 Given our large presence in London and elsewhere in Europe, does this affect 
 us, and do you want us to track down more information?
