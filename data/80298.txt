 
 Christie, I don't have any interest.  Jeff Shankman is a Penn guy and I am 
 sure he would like to do it and would be very effective.

 Hi Mike!
 
 Any interest in teaching one class, April 16 or 18, 10:30-12noon at Wharton 
 (Philadelphia)?  Please see details below.
 
 Thanks!

 Christie,
 
 no problem.  The course is a MBA course on privatization.  We currently talk 
 about project finance, and the idea was for Bill Gathman to talk about 
 Enron's Dabhol project.  However, this could be substituted with a discussion 
 of Enron's project finance activities in general, or with another project.  
 There are 55 students in the course (48 MBAs in their first and second years, 
 4 law school students in their 2nd year, and Ph.D. students in various 
 years).  Dates are either 16 or 18 April, the class starts at 10:30 am and 
 runs to noon.
 
 Let me know if you need any additional information.  Thank you.  Felix
 
 
     
 
 Hi Felix!
 
 Sorry I have not yet had any luck.  However, I will give it one more try.
 Would you please again give me the following:
 course description, date, # and year of students?  Sorry for your
 inconvenience...I'm really strapped for time, and this will be easier for
 me than trying to relocate the information you've provided before.
 
 Thanks!
 
 --Christie.

 Hi Christie,
 
 I was wondering if you had any luck with finding a speaker for the
 privatization course.
 
 Thanks for your help with this.
