 
 Have updated spreadsheet for known data tonight.  
 
 THESE THINGS NEED TO BE REVIEWED AND POSSIBLY CHANGED: 
 
 
 Had Perlman's total numbers from today, which she did no subdivide into EA, EIM and EGM numbers.  Made assumption that numbers from Sunday's spreadsheet for Beth's EGM and EIM totals stood, and backed into EA numbers by simply taking her total minus Sunday's EGM and EIM numbers.  You will want to gut check this with Beth. 
 
 Had Jenny's current total headcount (546) and her reductions to contractors and FTE's.  Didn't have detail on her contractor versus FTE numbers after reductions.  Just assumed 100 contractors, remaining FTE's.  You will need to get that detail from Jenny to correctly reflect her Revised Headcount.  
 
 There was a bust in numbers that I had for Commodity Logic Development.  Gros gave me the starting number of 46 (contractors and FTE's - but without current breakdown).  His reductions were 6 contractors and 8 FTE's, which should have left a revised total headcount of 32.  But I wrote down a revised total headcount of 24 for this group.  Off by 8, so I increased the number of contractor cuts to 14 to make the math work.  Please go over details with Tom and make corrections as needed.  
 
 Didn't have confirmed starting total headcount for ISC.  Spreadsheet with his FTE names gives a count of 129, so I assumed that he has 50 contractors to come up to the spreadsheet starting number of 179.   Allan only reduced by 3 FTE's and if he plans to reduce contractors I did not have that info.  So all other numbers for the ISC are simply forced.  Please review with Allan and make corrections as needed.  
 
  
 Have a nice Thanksgiving with your families.  You can reach my by cell phone tommorrow (mine: 713-417-1591 or David's:  713-299-1436) or at my parents' home starting about mid-afternoon (512-458-5510).  We will drive back from Austin sometime on Friday.  Could come in on Saturday or Sunday, as needed.  --Sally
