 	her out.  If not, then let's get together.  Thanks. Lynn

 Just got off the phone with Laura again.  She informed me that she had not deducted the GRI charges off Semco's invoices for April, May and June production.  I told her not to take the credits yet that Stacey was looking at the invoices.  
 
 I think we need to look at this together.
