 
 Steve Walton has suggested the following definitions concepts for definitions 
 of "Congestion Zone" and "Flowpath"
 
 Congestion Zone - Segment of Electric System within which there is minimal 
 congestion between busses.
 
 Flowpath - A facility or set of facilities that represent commercially 
 significant constraints within the transmission system.
 
 As we discussed, Steve affirmed that these are terms of art.
