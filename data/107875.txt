 Need your input on LNG, particularly email below and requests by VV Rao for 
 people in this office to be involved in LNG discussions.
 Steve Lowe claims the LNG group have booked $5MM off the back off NWS 4th 
 Train.  Steve claims he was instrumental in "introducing"  Enron LNG people 
 to the NWS consortium and to BHP wrt the Japan regas proposal.
 Would appreciate clarification on operation of the group.

 Hi Steve:  It was a pleasure to meet you again in Sydney.  You live in a 
 wonderful city. 
 
 The meeting with NWS is now confirmed for Thursday, Jan 11th in Dubai.  I 
 will be arriving with my colleague Satish Venkataraman on the morning of the 
 10th so we can have a day of preparation.  I suggest you plan on joining us 
 so we're all on the same page.  You'll need a visa which takes about 4 days 
 to process so I think you need to start on it right away.  My assistant 
 Dorice Cheong can help you with this.  Her number is (65) 838 9010.  
 
 I'll call you later this week to discuss the meeting further.
 
 Thanks, vvr
