 
 I am responding on behalf of Mark Haedicke.  We have checked with our 
 department and our lawyers are not aware of any such contracts as you 
 described in your e-mail. 
 
 Barbara Gray responded, "I am unaware of any subcontracts for this period.  I 
 do know that we have used minority lawyers, but that does not appear to be 
 responsive to the question."
 
 Thank you.
