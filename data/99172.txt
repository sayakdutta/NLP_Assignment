 
 What about Midland or (worse) Galveston ?
 
  
     
 	Thanks.  
 	On an unrelated note, I have Dan Shilliday checking and re-checking to see if there is a Costilla lawsuit anywhere to be found.  I'll keep you posted.  Jeff needed to reschedule our meeting till tomorrow so there is no new news on that front either.
