 Attached is link for Financial Trading position.  Job descriptions may not match precisely with your position as it exists today, but that is OK.  We have tried to be as broad as possible in describing the open positions to minimize the number of posting links. Your job will not change, and your offer will be made for the position and duties you are performing now.  The posting requirement is by end of day on Monday, even though this link says by Friday.  You can access the link from the internet at the office or at home.  Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
  
 
 
 Regards,
 
 Randy Curry
