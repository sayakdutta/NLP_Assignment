 perceived problems. I agree that the letter should be short, but lets 
 eliminate their argument that we did not give complete notice.

 Mitch,
 
 Here's a first draft.  Please suggest any additional complaints/shortfalls 
 which we need to raise.  It is better to be all inclusive than leave 
 something out.
 
 
 
 Richard, any ideas or comments?
 
 Kay
