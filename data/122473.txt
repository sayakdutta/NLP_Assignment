 
 Kyle,
  
 Sorry for not sending this yesterday.  Monday's are always tough.  Please review and let me know what you think.  Let's talk before I leave town next Wednesday.
  
 Thanks, Kim.
 
     
 
 Kim,
 Here is the Job Description and the Operational Accountabilities for the position I mentioned to you last Sunday.  As you can see it will take someone with some very good skills in organizing and interpersonal relationships.  It will also require someone who is fairly mature in their own spiritual journey.  If you know someone who might fit the bill ask them to contact me and/or send me their resume.
 See you Sunday.
  
 Tom
