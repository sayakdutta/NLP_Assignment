 
 Guys, I would like to schedule a quarterly meeting to review our technical 
 risk as a part of this reporting procedure.  Wayne can you set up a meeting 
 for the four of us over the next few weeks.  
 
 Regards
 Delainey

 Attached are first drafts of reports for Dave Delainey that detail assets 
 that may or may not pose a technical risk for ENA. The current draft was 
 developed with input from Wayne Mays, Mark Dobler and Andrea Reed.
 
 I would be most appreciative if each of you would review these reports at 
 your earliest convenience and respond back with your comments/updates.  
 Please note:   In the Technical book dated 8/03 there are 2 tabs - Risk and 
 No risk.
 
 Dave has asked for this report to be updated monthly for inclusion in a 
 reporting package for ENA's Office of the Chair.  After we are satisfied that 
 this is the proper format and is all inclusive I will communicate a process 
 for monthly updates.
 
 Thanks in advance for your assistance.
