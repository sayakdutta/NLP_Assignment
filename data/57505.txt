 Re:       Presidential Gala on May 22nd
 
 
 I hope you and/or your colleagues will join us in the first major event 
 honoring President and Mrs. Bush on May 22, 2001 in Washington, D.C.
 
 Would you please consider buying a table for your office or tickets for 
 individual colleagues?  The reception and dinner is a gathering of government 
 officials from the White House, U.S. Senate, U.S. House as well as as 
 Governors and other state and local government leaders.
 
 Please use the attachments to
      -  Purchase a table or ticket(s), and
      -  Forward this e-mail to colleagues.
 The deadline to respond is May 18th!
 
 Please e-mail a reply back to me so that I do not bother you with follow-up 
 emails or phone calls stating:
      -  The number of tickets or a table that you will be purchasing, or
      -  You already purchased your tickets or table, or
      -  You will not be participating in the May 22nd event.
 
 For your use, I am attaching a (1) letter from the Co-Chairmen of the Gala, 
 Jeff Marcus and Al Hoffman; (2) response form to fax or mail to the RNC; and 
 (3) hyper-link to the Gala website to register online or join various 
 membership groups of the RNC.
 
 I look forward to hearing from you.
