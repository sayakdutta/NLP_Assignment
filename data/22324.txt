 

 interim authority, expires today.  Given current market conditions, I would 

 additional two weeks starting today.
 
 Jeff, as per our meeting today, we may want to think about additional 

 PPA's, the potential NStar deal and the current gas market as we enter the 
 winter season.  I will take your lead on this one.
