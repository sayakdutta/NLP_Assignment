 
 Thanks for the address.  We will keep you all (especially Grant) in our prayers, although I don't think there's any hope for you.
 
  
     
 Thought you might like to have Grant's mailing address for card or note while
 he is in Bethesda for surgery.  He really appreciates getting mail.  We will
 be there from December 1st thru December 18th with Grant's surgery scheduled
 for the 6th of December.
