 Wildcats:
 
 The Lions could only field a team of 9 players for the game Saturday and
 we
 have been asked to change the game time to:
 
 Sunday, October 22 at  4:30pm
 
 Unless there is an overwhelming negative response to the change, I will
 advise
 the league in the Friday morning that we will agree to the schedule
 change.
 
 So, if you are opposed to the time change please call me before 8am
 Friday, at:
 281.541.1878.
 
 Thank you.
