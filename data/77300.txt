 
 I'm going to work really hard this week to see if I can catch up a bit, and 
 take a day off soon.
 
 
    
  
 I've been through several 4th quarters and YIKES is right!  You better try 
 and take some time off before then or you aren't going to get it.  I'm glad 
 we are going in October to Las Vegas.

 Just wait for the 4th quarter.  YIKES.
 
 
 
    
  
 I know you can silly.  Marty said he wouldn't be coming since he's 
 transitioning to EES.  Rose said she'd try and Lisa said yes.  I left VMs for 
 Scott and Brian along with the emails.  Sheila will be there too.
 
 It's meeting city today between you and Dan.
