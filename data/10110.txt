 FYI - These all of the speaker presentations at our meeting in Kansas City on September 6-7:
  
  
 
  
 
 The presentations have been posted to NNG's "Download" Site at <http://www.nng.enron.com/dob/etfr_downloads.html> at the bottom of the page. These presentations will be hard to email due to the size of the them.  My suggestion would be if a customer wants to save the presentations on their PC, the easiest way to do this is:
 
 1. Right mouse click on the presentation link
 2. "Save target as"
 3. Pick the directory where you want to save it
 4. Click on "save"
 
 This will download the presentation or presentations they wish to save to their PC.
 
 Thx,
 
 Toby
