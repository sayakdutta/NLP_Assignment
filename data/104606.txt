 
 Attached is our form of confirm with attached Annex A (general terms and 
 conditions).  Assume the confirm is governed by Texas law.  Most 
 counterparties sign the confirm and fax it back to us WITHOUT the attached 
 Annex A.  Is this sufficient under Texas law as having received the 
 "executed" confirmation?  Do we need to modify our language incorporating the 
 Annex A?  Thanks.  Sara (713/853-5620)
