 Sara,
 
 I hope you have now received instructions from your commercial swaps team to 
 put together an ISDA  currency swap and confirm which ECT Corp will be 
 providing to either Enron Europe Power 3 Limited or a subsidiary of that 
 company. The subsidiary will be receiving dollars under a bond issue and 
 paying pounds out (a spot transaction I believe) but will then receive pounds 
 income which it will need to convert to dollars to pay interest on the bonds.
 
 The precedent document is the Sutton Bridge currency swap.
 
 Can you please confirm you have been instructed and let us know your timing 
 for issuing a document.  The sooner we can see this next week the better.
 
 The bond trustee will as usual require the swap to be backed with legal 
 opinions from Enron in-house counsel (Mark Haedicke) re due execution and 
 from V&E (Terry Yates) re enforceability. My understanding is that the swap 
 will not be guaranteed by Corp (correct Julian?).
 
 Linklaters are representing Enron - Julian Davies and Fran Xavier (tel: 171 
 456 2000). Could you please send them your fax, telephone and email details. 
 Linklaters have kindly agreed to prepare a first draft of the Mark Haedicke 
 opinion and to send it out to you Sara.
 
 Thank  you. I look forward to hearing from you.
 
 
      Mark
