 We are long in Enpower for tomorrow due to a parking arrangement with EPE at 
 PV.     We added this deal late,  so make sure that the EPE dispatcher knows 
 of this late preschedule of energy to EPE.
 We are long the following hours/mws:
 
 He 7-10    3mw's
 He 11-22     10mw's
 
 The length is reflected on deal #476644 and this energy should be marketed 
 hourly.    We need to communicate early with EPE and make sure that this goes 
 as smoothly  as possible.     Once sold,  of course enter the sale( under ST 
 SW book)  and route to the length.
 This deal is completely ST SW in Enpower and we will share any profits with 
 ST SW.
 
 Thanks,
 JMF
