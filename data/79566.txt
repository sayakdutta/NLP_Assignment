 
 All,
 
 Here is the latest draft.  Please make any changes you want and return.  
 Paper mark up is best.  Also please leave as a separate word document if you 
 do it via email  for ease of changing and converting to email late afternoon.
 
 Cathy, please review for your normal grammar and corrections.  I realize that 
 this is a draft but it will help to have your changes early even though we 
 will be making additional changes in the afternoon.
 
 Larry, I would like your feedback and commentary as well.
 
 Thanks,
 mike
