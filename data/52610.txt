 Thanks
  
     
 Vince: 
 I wanted to get back to you with a reply to your question about my  
 recommendation on a patent attorney.  I cannot give you a personal  
 recommendation per se because, in the end, I opted not to hire an attorney to  
 file my patent until I had decided whether I wanted to protect my work as a  
 trade secret or as a patented commodity.  I ultimately struck a compromise  
 position by filing my own "provisional patent application."  This establishes  
 the date of my claim and gives me one year in which to finalize the patent?  
 or not; it also provides patent pending protection from the date I filed it  
 with the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office. 
 In the process of investigating the options for safeguarding my intellectual  
 property, however, I did talk to quite a number of patent attorneys.  Of  
 these, I think that perhaps David Richie might be the most appropriate for  
 your son's software idea.  He talked as though he had a particular specialty  
 in software issues; he also struck me as competent and aggressive.  He  
 practices in the Silicon Valley and can be reached at telephone number (408)  
 282-1856. 
 I suspect that he has already done so, but if not, your son might want to  
 visit the internet site of the U. S. Patent Office.  Basic information and  
 forms can be downloaded from there.  Two other, newer sites might also  
 intrigue him-both deal with the protection, valuation and marketing of  
 intellectual property, patents, etc.  They are:   
 pl-x.com (The Patent and License Exchange, Inc.) 
 yet2come.com 
 Hope this is helpful. 
 Regards, 
 Larry Thorne
