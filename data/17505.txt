 for residential (since of course the damage that wholesale prices will 
 inflict will grossly outweigh and alleged benefits). But any caps must be 
 accompanied by real, strucutural reforms.  Have a great time.  Please let us 
 know how it goes.  (I have a sneaking suspicion they listen to you more than 
 you let on.)
 
 Best,
 Jeff
