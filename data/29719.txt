 
 The insurance has been purchased by Enron exclusively to cover our equity and 
 our subd debt through our commercial program (not OPIC).  We  have covered 
 the following investments to date on Cuiaba.
 
 EPE                 $235MM
 GASMAT $  60MM
 GASBOL $132MM
 
 Up to US$200MM could be reimbursed for an insuarble event.  However, that 
 $200 may be limited by draws associated with insurable events at other 
 projects.  This $200MM could be further limited by draws from other projects 
 because the program has a cap of $250MM total, but the cap can be reinstated 
 following a draw with an exclusion for the country where the previous hit 
 occurred.

 Rob,
 Isn't the $200 million the cap of OPIC and doesn't that apply to 100% of the 
 equity covered by OPIC, which means that, I guess (and I don't know if Shelll 
 qualifies or if we structured around this) we share with Shell the $200 
 million on the basis of equity percentages held by each?
 Thanks

 I believe that is correct.

 Rob,
 
 Didn't he say we were only covered up to $200 MM (e.g. the limit of our 
 contract frustration cover?) With the current Shell/enron sharing 
 percentages, it would seem that we are entitled to 72% of the $360 MM payment 
 or $259 MM, thus we would only be out by $59 MM.

 According to Cliff Shedd, we would be covered by insurance if we terminated 
 the contract with Furnas and Furnas failed to pay the termination payment.  
 However the insurers will only pay after we receive an arbitration judgement 
 against them and the refuse to honor the judgement.  I assume we would also 
 have to exhaust our remedies against trhe guarantor (Eletrobras).
 
 Also, we are required to notify the underwriters immediately of a material 
 default.
