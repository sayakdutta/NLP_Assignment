 
 Attached is that chart that were supposed to replace with the current one on 
 price volatility.  I tried to open it up, but it was all gobbeldy gook.  
 Maybe you could print it out for me and then I could take a look at it and if 
 it looks OK we could just replace it with existing one.  Thanks!
