 
 I talked to Susan last Friday and she gave me her changes which I put into 
 the doc.  So I am only waiting on Foti and Dushinske's changes.
 
 Attached is the Vector term sheet.

 gerald,
 
 i have a couple of questions for you:
 
 1)  susan scott told me that she would get back to you with some of the nits 
 that she had on the hubbard document.  i am waiting for the final comments 
 from dushinske, but they should come today.  i would like to get everything 
 signed today because we want to make sure that we can book the gas at these 
 high prices.
 
 2)  vector term sheet.  i seem to have deleted my copy of the most recent 
 draft we had circulating.  can you send me your most recent update, please?
 
 if i hear anything from dushinske, i will let you know,
 
 thanks,
 
 jamie
