 
 Please look at two supply deals with Enserco at the Citygate for March 2001.  Nov-Mar deal, number 396352, at 11.27 and a March only deal, number 63338(?),  at 10.59.  They are contesting the fact that we allocated all cuts to the highest priced deal.  Cost $72000.  Please take a look at these deals and the cuts and let me know if we should agree to their argument and reallocate 50/50.
 
 Thanks,
 Mike
