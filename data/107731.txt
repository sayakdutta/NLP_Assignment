 A few weeks ago, we sent you a letter extending an invitation to a cocktail 
 party on January 24 at the CAM and a Texas barbecue at the Fabulous Satellite 
 Lounge on January 25.
 We've not heard back from you as to whether or not you can attend either or 
 both special events planned for the directors attending the Association of 
 Art Museum Directors' meeting in Houston next week.
 
 Could you please let me know as soon as possible if you plan to attend either 
 or both of these special events! Thanks.
