 Ragtime.  The show is coming to Houston's Jones Hall, with the special

 Century whose lives become dramatically intertwined as they are caught up in 
 the events of a young, turbulent country.
 
 To redeem this special discount opportunity, OnePass members should call 
 Ticketmaster at 713-629-3700 and mention ticket type code "L-type".
