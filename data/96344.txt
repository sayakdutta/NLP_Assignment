 I have reviewed Chris' version of the Confirmation below.  I have made a
 few changes to it now that there is only one Delivery Period.  The attached
 is red-lined for ease of reference.
 
 As far as I am concerned, it is ready to go. Let's see if Elizabeth
 concurs.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Shari

 The attachment  cleans up a few nits.  The word "Period" was omitted in
 a couple spots in the Description of Transaction paragraph.  Got weekend
 plans?
