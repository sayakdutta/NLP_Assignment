 
 Alberto,
 
 You're best bet is to send a resume to Chris Gaskill.  Chris is starting a 
 new fundamental analysis group.  I know he
 is looking for a few more people to get this group off the ground.  If you're 
 interested in trading, it's probably the best
 way to get involved in this side of the business.  I'm not sure if you have a 
 long term interest in trading or if you're just
 looking for a rotation.  Give me a call also after 4pm and I could provide 
 you with some insight into the area.
 
 Until then send Chris an email with your resume attached or you could talk to 
 me first if you'd like.
 
 Kevin
