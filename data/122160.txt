 Has this been corrected?  Please keep Jan informed of any invoice changes. 
 
 Thanks, Kim.
 
  
     
 
 FYI.
  
     
 FYI - In working to load rates for the FERC California reporting requirements, it appears that for the last four months Duke Energy T & M contract #27291 has not been billed the incremental fee of $0.06/dth for alternate deliveries to the Cal Border (over and above the base discount negotiated for the contracted primary points).
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
 
 Thanks,
 Elizabeth
