 
 We had a wonderful, quiet weekend. The wine was very good.  I drank it 
 without food, as it was nice and light, which is how I like my reds.  It 
 would have been good with a tomato based pasta, I think.
 
 How do I find out how much vacation I have?  I know there's a system on the 
 intranet.  I want to plan some time off this year, if possible.  I know how 
 difficult it can get the longer I wait.
 
 Thursday I won't be in until around noon. More Michael stuff.
