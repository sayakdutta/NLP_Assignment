 A major network is planning the show "Survivor 2" this winter. In
 response,
 Texas is planning "Survivor: Texas Style." The contestants will
 start in  Dallas, travel through Waco, Austin, San Antonio, over to
 Houston,
 and down to Brownsville. They will proceed up to Del Rio, on to El Paso,
 then to Midland/Odessa, Lubbock, and Amarillo. From there, they proceed to
 Abilene, and on to Ft. Worth and back to Dallas.
 Each will be driving a pink Volvo with a bumper sticker that reads, "I'm
 gay,    I voted for Al Gore, and I'm here to confiscate your guns."
 The first one to make it back to Dallas wins.
