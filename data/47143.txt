 
 I just spoke to Credit about one counterparty on the list.  You've got Utah 
 Municipal Power Agency shut down to trade since they're not FERC authorized.  
 They specifically came through online wanting to trade power, and Credit 
 wants to know if you can give them a call and determine if you can get 
 whatever evidence you need to get them open for power.  The name of the guy 
 that sent the application in is Richard Judd and his ph no. is (801) 
 852-6842.  Thanks!
