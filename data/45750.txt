 I am having this woman with Duke here in Houston, Roni Cappadonna, calling me 
 wanting to get the form of the confirmation.  I don't know what to tell her.  
 Can we get her a draft of a confirm with proposed deal terms or do we have to 
 wait until the trade is done?  I think the person that really needs to be 
 handling this is Dale Neuner, not me.  I am kinda just in the middle of the 
 confirm thing.  Can we get Scott Neal, or whoever needs to relay the confirm 
 information, to deal with Dale Neuner directly, so we can get Dale dealing 
 with Roni.
