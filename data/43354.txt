 
 Thanks, John, I will add Sarita to my "cc" list.    And, yes, we'll get both 
 you and Phil on Stan's calendar to go over the "Operations Alliances" 
 topic...I will await their call to schedule.

 Cindy,
 Will you please add my new Administrative Assistant to your future "cc" 
 lists?  She is Sarita Garza.  Thanks so much.  John
 
 P.S.  I have asked Sarita and Amelia to get with you and see when a favorable 
 date would be that Phil Lowry and I could have about 30 minutes with Stan to 
 go over the "Operations Alliances" with him (since his half day staff meeting 
 was cancelled for May 16).  Anyway, this is just a heads-up that they will be 
 in touch to get a date confirmed.  Thank you.  JHS

 This is to advise you that we have canceled next Monday's (May 21) 9:15AM ETS 
 Staff Meeting and will resume the following week on Tuesday (May 29) from 
 9:30 to 11:00AM in 49C2.  
 
 NOTE:  Next week, in the absence of our staff meeting, Stan would like you to 
 send him (via electronic mail) brief, updated bullet points.
 
 Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.
 
 Thanks,
