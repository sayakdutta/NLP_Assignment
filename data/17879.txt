 PG&E was very tactical.
 They knew that the Edison deal was imminent.
 They see the Edison deal as extremely adverse to their interests.
 They feared that the pressure on them to do the same deal would be enormous 
 once the Governor announced the Edison deal.
 Thus, in an incredibly dramatic attempt to pre-empt the possibility that 
 they'd have to accept the Edison deal, PG&E threw itself into bankruptcy.  
 (Preemption seems to have been very successful, at least at this point.)
 So I think that they wanted everyone to know, including Wall Street and the 
 Governor, that the decision's been made---they're going the way of Ch. 11, 
 not the way of J. Bryson and Edison.
 
 This make sense?
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 What was the point of that statement?  It sure seemed like a non-statement...
