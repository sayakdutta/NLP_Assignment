 great.  thanks greg - i told you about the wireless ethernet stuff i bought right?  i'm excited to set it up.  
 
 i don't know if you've seen the site, but www.practicallynetworked.com has some good stuff in it.  
 
 coffee or lunch this week works great for me - where are you working downtown?

 You should be getting a call from Shaw Cable, today or tomorrow to arrange a
 time with you to install the cable modem.
  FYI, I bought a used computer at Computer Outlet, and two months free
 internet and installation came with the package.
 
 Let me know if  you don't hear from shaw in the next day or so. Looks like
 I'm going to be working downtown starting sometime this week, we should try
 to get out for a coffee or bit to eat again.
 
 Cheers, Greg
