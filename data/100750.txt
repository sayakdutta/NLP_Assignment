 
 Hey, I'll try and give you a call tonight at your flat.  As far as "free 
 nights" over Thanksgiving go...I'm pretty much open Tues, Wed, Fri and Sat.  
 Katy and I are very excited about taking you out to get some REAL 
 margaritas.  I can't remember where your favorite ones are, but where ever 
 they may be the drinks are on me.  (Although given your increased tolerance 
 these days, you may break me).  The reason I was asking about when you were 
 coming home is...Jeffy Jeff is playing Gruene Hall the 15th and 16th of 
 December and If you were up to it, I thought it'd be a good weekend trip for 
 you, Katy, myself and whomever else may want to tag along (especially since 
 it doesn't look like we'll be making it to Gruene over New Years).  Plus, if 
 we did go I think I could swing leaving Friday night and not coming back 
 until Monday morning...The outlet mall is calling your name.  
 
 Talk to you soon,
 Susan
 
 PS - I have encouraging news regarding London, I'll tell you more about it 
 when I talk to you.
