 Tricia, thank you for Kay Mann's  refund in the amount of $500 for the 
 above-referenced seminar.  The cost of the seminar, however,  was $595.  I 
 cancelled this seminar two days before the cancellation deadline of March13, 
 2001 (cancellation number X197033661), but Kay was still charged the $95 
 cancellation administrative fee.  Please advise when she can expect this $95 
 to be credited to her American Express card.  
 
 Thanks, Suzanne Adams
