 Hoyle.  If you don't get anyone to talk with John Rodgers, don't worry about 
 it.  I may have someone that could talk with him from the EnronOnline team.

 Sally,
 
 I have arranged for Chris Hoyle to meet with Chris Hanz, Sr. Director 
 Business Analyst at 11:00 a.m. tomorrow in EB1812.  Lexi is going to bring 
 Chris to the 18th floor and pick him up at 11:30.  I am still trying to 
 arrange for someone to meet with John as well and as soon as I have that 
 information I will let you know.  I am having some problems due to the fact 
 that we have one of our office visit events taking place during that time.
 
 Thanks,
 Ashley

 This will work well, assuming Steve and Chris are available.  Hopefully, Lexi 
 will have their resumes for you tomorrow.   Thanks for your help.  I will be 
 in touch on details.
