 Dear All
 
 Thank you very much for agreeing to meet with Mauro Formaggio during his visit to Enron in Houston on 23 & 24 August.
 
 As Alfredo wrote in previous e-mails:
 
 "Mr Formaggio is a very precious contact at the Italian Energy Authority, and he is very much involved in the drafting of regulations regarding third party access to pipelines, and despatch/operational rules for transcos. He expects to learn from us about the general operation of a big pipeline (despatching operation, commercial scheduling of transmission, nomination, balancing and allocation, as well as the infomation that the pipeline gives to the general public and to regulatory authorities)."
 
 Mr Formaggio anticipates being available all day on Thursday 23rd and Friday 24th so I hope you might be able to find some time to meet with him on those days.  Perhaps if you asked your respective assistants to let me know times that do NOT suit you on those dates & how long you think it will appropriate for you to meet with him, I can draw up a schedule?
 
 Joe - I cannot discern from previous e-mails whether you will be in Houston on 23 & 24 August & if you are, whether you will have time to see Mr Formaggio?
 
 Thank you & regards

 Dear Mr Formaggio
 
 Sorry for taking so long to communicate with you about your trip to Houston later this month.
 
 The dates of 23 and 24 August suit the relevant people at Enron in Houston so I trust that those dates are still convenient for you?
 
 The people with whom I am in the process of confirming meetings are as follows:
 
 1. 	Joe Hartsoe, Vice President, Regulatory & Legislative Affairs
 	Joe is our FERC expert.  He works out of our Washington, DC office but I am hoping that he may be able to travel to 
 	Houston to meet with you.
 
 2. 	Rebecca Cantrell or Leslie Lawner, Directors, Regulatory Affairs 
 	Either of these two women can give you a shipping perspective so I will arrange for you to meet one of them.
 
 3. 	Dannis Bellard, Gas Control
 	Dannis will give you a gas control tour
 
 4. 	Lynn Blair, Director, Customer Services
 	Lynn will discuss transportation, scheduling, OBA, TPA matter with you.
 	
 5. 	Shelley Corman, Gas Logistics and Communications
 	Shelley heads up the Gas Logistics group & she will make to meet with you.
 
 I will confirm the meetings once I know when you are arriving and departing Houston.
 
 Please let me know if you need assistance booking flights, airport transfers & a hotel in Houston - Enron has corporate rates with two hotels within walking distance to the Enron building so do let me know if you would like me to make any reservations on your behalf.
 
 Please also let me know if you have any questions.
 Regards

 Mauro. Please find attached the details of Amber Keenan, my assistant. I am leaving on vacation on 2nd Aug, so you should liase with her in order to get the details of your visit. 
 
 Amber. I already talked to Joe Hartsoe, and they are happy to meet Formaggio (please, read my previous e-mail). Joe is trying to get hold of Shelley to find a suitable time within the dates suggested by Formaggio.

 Dear Alfredo,
 a tentative schedule for the visit to Northern (or other major pipeline) would be for me the 23 and 24 of August (Thursday and Friday).
 Alternatively, the 20 and 21 of August (Monday and Tuesday of the same week).
 I will be on holiday for the next two weeks.
 You can contact me on the usual e-mail.
 I'm not completely sure of the access from a remote site, so please note also my personal e-mail:

 Thank you for the assistance, and best regards
 Mauro
