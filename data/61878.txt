 I need to make you aware of a potential lawsuit we may be filing jointly with 
 Columbia Energy Services/Nisource against TDC Energy regarding a CES 
 transaction.  I don't have every detail yet, but I wanted to fill you in 
 because this is moving quite quickly.
 
 TDC Energy is a small privately owned producer that had several deals with 
 CES that ENA acquired in last year's transaction.  Four of those transactions 
 were costless collars that are deep in the money for us.  TDC is disputing 
 the existence of these collars because CES never sent confirmations for 
 them.   We have taken the position with CES that if TDC defaults it is CES' 
 exposure, not ENA's.  The total value of these collars as of today is 
 approximately $4,800,000.   I have been working with Jeff Hodge on this issue 
 and we believe that, because of several different reasons, ENA should file 
 the lawsuit with TDC jointly.  I'll be happy to meet with you if you're 
 interested and explain the reasons for this.
 
 In addition, ENA has other deep in the money fixed priced transactions with 
 TDC worth an estimated $5,000,000 (unofficially from R. Diamond in Credit)   
 TDC has not disputed these transactions and so far all is fine with these; 
 however, we fear that TDC may be facing financial difficulties--if they go 
 bankrupt, we have exposure on the $5,000,000 of fixed price transactions, 
 plus potentially all or part of the other $4,800,000 of financial collars.  
 Jeff Hodge is meeting today with CES' outside attorneys to discuss where we 
 should file the lawsuit and I get the impression that it is already drafted 
 and will be filed very soon.  Please let me know if you want to talk through 
 this.
