You mentioned that your functional PRC will be set for sometime between June 7 and June 14.  It would certainly be best from my point of view if my PRC occurs prior to your functional PRC.  While a number of PRC meetings will be held within Operations during the week of June 4 in preparation for our June 11th meeting, that will be the first date where we will cross calibrate directors, senior directors and VP's across ENA, EGM and EIM operations.  
 
 I thought that it might be helpful to know the date of my operations PRC meeting in setting the date for your meeting.  Please let me know as soon as a date has been set for your PRC.  
 
 Thanks.
