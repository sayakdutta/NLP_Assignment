 Dear Mr. Kaminski: 
 
 On June 8 last, we held a special web-based conference call pertaining to a 
 new CERA multiclient study, "The Future of European Power: Electricity 
 without Borders".? Participants in this complimentary call learned first-hand 
 some of the initial results of the study, and how the study provides a 
 framework for evaluating current and future company strategies.
 
 We are pleased to announce the availability of the recorded presentation on 
 our website.? To view the presentation, please visit our website at:?

 The presentation focused on the study scope and approach, and its underlying 
 analysis.? In addition, the link above will also provide access to the 
 prospectus for the study, including the deliverables and enrollment 
 information.? If your organization has not yet enrolled in the study, we urge

 CERA's European Power services then please contact me by reply email or
