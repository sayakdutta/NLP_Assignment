 
 Ross,
 
 The only thought I have with respect to this request would be that it should 
 not apply if FCEL has failed to comply with its warranty obligations, or has 
 declined to service the modules after the warranty period has expired.

 Jackie, Stephen, Scott, Kay, Heather:
 
 We have an additional item we did not discuss today. We want to add to the
 agreement a provision to the effect that: 
    
 The Purchaser (include their successors and/or assigns, subcontractors,
 vendors, operators, etc.) may not open or in any other manner attempt to
 view the interior of the DFC modules without Seller's express written
 consent. Failure to comply with this provision would: a) Void all warranties
 with respect to the Unit and b) Be considered an automatic violation and
 breach of the confidentiality provisions of the agreement and subject to all
 remedies for such violation.
 
 Tony: We will also add the same provision to the O&M manuals.
 
 Jackie: Please draft appropriate language for the agreement and include it
 in the latest draft of the agreement.
 
 Thank you.
