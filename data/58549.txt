 while she is out.  Further,  I was only copying her on messages that many 
 others received (so I don't need to hear back from her).  But, if this is a 
 standard message going out to everyone while the fires continue to rage in 
 California, I think it leaves a bad impression.  Can we find a way to direct 
 urgent requests to someone else in the office or to someone on our external 
 lobby team?

 I will be out of the office starting  11/09/2000 and will not return until 
 11/27/2000.
 
 I will respond to your message when I return.
