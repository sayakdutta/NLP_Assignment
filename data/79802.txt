 Hello from Singapore.  Thanks for the email.  I am interested in the 
 Lichtenstein.  Is the #4 the same as the one you had in the gallery?
 What is the price and what does the frame look like?  Do you have a picture 
 or could you put it on your website?
 I am still interested in the Matisse but Chris isn't so sure.  We are still 
 thinking about that one.
 Thanks,
 Mike
