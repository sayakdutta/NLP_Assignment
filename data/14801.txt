 
 Great Rosemary,
  
 I'm so slow in thanking you for the lovely party.  You are the best.
  
 My sister will be here for our lunch on Monday too.  We're going to be out shopping that day.
 
 
     
 
 the 19th is the best for me; 11:45? This will be fun!!! Christi, I am happy to make the reservations if you want!
