 expectations probably does not fit the average person's view of a person in 
 Satisfactory.  Perhaps "met most, but not all" or something like that would 
 be more accurate.
 
 Where are we on the total revamp?  Has that been postponed until next year?
 
 Thanks.  Michelle

 Hi Michelle;
 
 I have attached the latest version of the proposed cluster descriptors for 
 year end-2000.  We would like to have these reviewed by the VP/MD PRC 
 Committee tomorrow , but wanted to ensure that you saw them first.  They 
 comprise merely a refinement of the present descriptors, with an effort to 
 demonstrating "relativity".  let me know your thoughts, thanks, G
