 Michelle,
 I have run across a few agreements where the employee has signed the agreement but not dated it.  Is this something that could potentially be a problem?
 I think that, for our (exec comp) purposes, the agreement is not actually in effect until it is signed by the person "offering" the terms.  Is this true?
 Thank you
