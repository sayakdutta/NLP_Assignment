 The start time for Tuesday morning has been changed from 9am to 8am.  
 Breakfast will be served at 7:30.  Therefore, shuttle pick up times at the 
 hotel for Tuesday morning have been changed to 7:10, 7:25, and 7:40 am.  
 Again, the last shuttle is not recommended if you intend to have breakfast at 
 the ASE.
 
 Some of you had asked about a coordinated dinner for Sunday night.  Since 
 arrival times into Dallas vary greatly, we are leaving you to your own 
 devices for Sunday night.  We are however, planning a group dinner for Monday 
 night after we wrap up for the day.  We will arrange transportation from the 
 ASE to the restaurant and from the restaurant back to the hotel.  Currently, 
 Monday's agenda shows a completion time of 6:30pm.  Therefore, we are 
 planning to head to dinner directly from the ASE without a break or trip back 
 to the hotel.
