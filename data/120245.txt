 
 Thought this was interesting
 
  
     
 I understand there was a problem on my desk this week with a market that was
 posted and executed on by one of our traders. I was not in the office and a
 decision was made for the trade to stand.
 
 I apologize if there was a lack of professionalism at this end. We do a lot of
 business with Enron and  I am interested in keeping a working business
 relationship.
 
 Please include me in any discrepancies with our real-time traders and their
 accounts: pplhourly(1-8).
 
 A small deal,as I see it you owe us a jab...and I won't be asking for any
 favors any time soon.
 
 thanks
