 
 I would line up CA next.  
 
 Let me look over what Lee sent then I'll call (or you can call when you get 
 free).
 
 How was the game?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
 
 
 
 

   
  
 I am going to be on a conference call for the next hour or so. Please
 e-mail me or leave a voice mail mesage on how you want me to proceed
 with the Enron South America Agreement and also what the next agreement
 to be finalized should be.

 Kay:
 
 Lee Johnson and John Ayres are going to meet Monday morning at 8:30 to
 go
 through all the technical information in the contract to confirm
 everything.  They should get back to you very quickly with any changes.
 I
 think the primary thing they are discussing is using a combined
 guarantee
 rather than single unit.
 
 Thanks,
 Brett
