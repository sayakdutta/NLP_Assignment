 We are trying for a conference call on Friday, April 21 at 10:30 CENTRAL time.
 We are going to be discussing the HPL buy/sell agreement.  We are very close 
 to
 agreeing on procedures except for one issue:  the allocation of volumes at the
 Fuels Cotton Valley delivery point and the Valero delivery point.  If you can
 not make it please let me know ASAP.  If anyone has any questions please feel
 free to call me at 303.605.1804.  Otherwise I will talk to all of you on 
 Friday
 at 10:30 CENTRAL.
 
 Robert
