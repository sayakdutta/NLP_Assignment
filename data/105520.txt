 Dear Sara,
 
 As you requested, attached is a clean copy of the NDA between ECT and w-T, 
 reflecting the changes we have agreed to.
 Please have it executed and faxed back to 212-406-1694, to my attention, 
 after which I will return to you a fully
 executed copy.
 
 Thanks for you assistance in getting this done.
 
 Best regards,
