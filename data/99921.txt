 As the efficiencies of the lateral (between Bloomfield and Gallup) steadily decrease it is time to probably think about pigging that section again in time for the upcoming tariff season. We will be scheduling a meeting next week to talk about the following:
 1)	When should we do this?
 2)	Should we also consider surfactant cleaning?
 3)	It has been almost 6 months since the application of the DRA on that section. Should we re-apply?
 4)	What are the costs-outages, cost of app
 5)	What are the benefits.
 
 Please let John Sturn or myself know of when you cannot make a meeting next week.
 Thanks
