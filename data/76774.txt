 stroller on stage).  Otherwise, it was great.  Paige did really well, and she 
 was front and center for most of their act.
 
 I don't know what we are going to do about Thanksgiving.  Neil and I are 
 negotiating. I neglected to discuss it with Paige this weekend, of course.  
 It is hard to believe it is only a few weeks away.
 
 Michael and I are both better, although he didn't get better until Friday 
 night. 
 
 Hi to all!

 Hello!
 
 How did things go in Georgetown? I just wanted to see how it went and tell
 you again how sorry I am that things did not work out so that we could see
 you. Also, are yall going to Palacios for Thanksgiving? Are you staying at
 the bed and breakfast? I think we are going to come down on Saturday morning
 and we were thinking about getting a room for that night. Bobby claims that
 the pink house becomes the house of snores when we all stay there. He may
 have a point!
 
 Are you and Michael feeling better??
 
 Love you!
 
 Lisa
