 
 SInce you unfortunately made an unnecessary trip into the office yesterday during your vacation, I assume that you are perhaps out of the office today finishing that vacation.  I am certainly looking for your list of additional items/projects that you believe need to be added to or made more explicit in the draft document for Project Greenlight.  I have rescheduled a meeting with Rick Buy for next Friday, October 12 at 11:30. I hope that you will be able to attend.  I want to be certain that we have enough time to review your comments and concerns, reconvene the appropriate group of steering committee members and/or project managers, and make any necessary changes or additions to the document before that meeting. 
 
 I will be out of the office on Monday, taking Meagan to SMU for Mustang Monday - it's her one day off this fall for a teacher in-service day and nicely enough coincides with a scheduled day at SMU for high school seniors to visit.  I will be checking my e-mails when I get home that night, however.
