Outlined below are the revised topics and revised attendees.  The date, time and location of meetings on the calendars of  Wes, Faith and Louise remain unchanged - we have simply reorganized and reordered the ENW topics to be covered to facilitate the most beneifical grouping for understanding ENW's expenses.
