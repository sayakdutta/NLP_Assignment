 Dear Tana,
 
 Since we last discussed the above, I think I have only formally approved one 
 Japanese counterparty.  I am a bit concerned that something may be slipping 
 through the system.  Alternatively, no companies other than those on the 
 initial list have applied for passwords.  The metals people here came to see 
 me about one company recently but I have not been asked for approval re that 
 company formally yet.
 
 Thanks.
