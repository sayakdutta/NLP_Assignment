 and calculation of the "Credit Support Amount," our change should not create 
 any inconsistencies in the calculation of that amount among your 
 counterparties since it would only change IF the calculation yielded a 
 negative number.  The only reason for "specifying otherwise" in Paragraph 13 
 is to capture the situation where the Pledgor MIGHT be holding Independent 
 Amounts (if there are ever any specified in a particular Transaction) of the 
 Secured Party as cushion (which is not meant to be returned until termination 
 of Transactions) and subtraction of that amount would create a negative 
 number when calculating the Credit Support Amount.  By specifying that the 
 Credit Support Amount will be "the higher of" the amount calculated (deemed 
 to be zero if a negative number) or the sum of the Pledgor's Independent 
 Amounts, the latter would prevail.  This calculation method will make a 
 difference if, for example, the Secured Party asks for a Return Amount when 
 the Pledgor intends to retain any Independent Amounts as cushion (such that 
 only Posted Credit Support exceeding the sum of the Independent Amounts will 
 be returned).  I hope this helps.  Sara
 
 
 
 

    
 
      Hi Sara,
      Confirming or conversation, only 2 issues remain unresolved.
 
      1.  Please remove subclause (B) in Part 5(g) Setoff.  As we discussed,
          this contemplates including all kinds of "obligations of any kind
          whatsoever" and it is our intent to include only Energy trading
          under this Agreement.
 
      2.  Please explain the reasoning for modifying the definition of
          "Credit Support Amount" in Paragraph 13(b)(C) of the Credit
          Support Annex.  We would prefer to retain the intent of ISDA's
          definition to maintain consistency in the way this amount is
          determined among our counterparties.
 
      Thank you for all your assistance and I look forward to receiving
      execution copies of the Agreement if these two issues can be resolved.
 
      Best regards,
      Marty Oelmann
