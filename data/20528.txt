 
 Baldwin's traveling--meeting with DWR today.  But he knows we want to meet and knows the days we're talking about--left a message with his secretary.  I suspect that, if DWR is free on either Monday or Tuesday, we'll be meeting.
 
 Followed up with Fielder this morning.  He's at an off-site all day and is supposed to call me back COB today.  He knows we want to meet with Craver and offered to set it up.  If he hasn't got it scheduled when I talk to him, I'll go directly to Craver.  I'll hopefully have things more set in stone by end of today or tomorrow by noon.
 
 That work?
 
 Best,
 Jeff
