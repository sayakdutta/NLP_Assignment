 Those numbers are impressive without a doubt.  The success has had the 
 unfortunate consequence of showing the limits of our current internet 
 technology.  The delays in messages from the stacks to the website have 
 gotten worse in recent weeks.  This is only anecdotal evidence but as a 
 trader on the system it has been very frustrating.
