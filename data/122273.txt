I don't worry too much about having to cancell, but I think a lot will shake out over the next 6-8 weeks here at 1400 Smith.  I'll keep working Dot to see if she and Tom are willing to commit to a spring vs. fall timeframe.  I suspect Janell and Dennis will be no go for anytime in 02.  If Dot and Tom are game then we can talk with D & T and P & J about meeting Jane and Barry to make our party and even 8.  If Dot and Tom are not available to go, I'm more comfortable just making the traveling party a foursome.  
 
 Have a great day!  ILY, K.
 
 
     
 
 I agree.  I hope that the first decision point, perhaps this week, answers
 the "if" question.  Then, perhaps by the end of the month, if the answer to
 "if" is "yes," we can then answer the "when" question.

 I still think we're GO, but I heard Dorothy and Kim do the "it depends on
 Enron" and Janell has the broken leg issue.  Hopefully it all works out
 well.  We're not at the deadline yet but at some point we'll have to make a
 call.
 
 The first hurdle is the U of H accelerated Italian course in mid February
 which I plan to attend unless we've aborted.  The real deadline is somewhere
 around D-30 days when the air fare/schedule becomes harder to get.
