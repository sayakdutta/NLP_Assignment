 Dan, thanks for your submission of all the contracts, I've not been able to
 devote all of my time to them, but they are in varying stages of
 completion.  This will be a short week with the holiday, so I wanted to
 touch base with you and let you know that we probably will not be able to
 address these contract issues until the week of Nov. 27th.
 
 I hope you have a safe and happy Thanksgiving.
 
 Ellen Dailey
