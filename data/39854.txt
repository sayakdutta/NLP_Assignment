 set.  Is that an appropriate response?

 Mr. Walls
 
 I was checking the stock prices when I saw the Enron=01%s homepage saying "=
 The
 power of Why". So, I=01%ve decided to write these few words. Certainly you =
 do
 not remember me as you meet lots of people everyday around the world. But I
 had the pleasure of meeting you when I was attending a SAP training course
 in 2000 when I was in Houston.
 I worked for the Legal Departament in the Sao Paulo office and had been
 developing a good job (at least my performance evaluations said so) when I
 was said teh company was firing many people and I was included in the fatal
 list. My immediate supervisors tried to do everything they could to keep me
 there and all the answers were no.
 I want you to know that this message is not to complain about my firing.
 Everyone who works is subject to this fact, specially in Brazil. I simply
 became astonished when I was told that two people are being hired for the
 same position I had less than 2 months after I left the company.
 So, my question is WHY? Why and how does Enron commit such a mistake? I
 really trusted the company I used to work for, I really enjoyed working for
 Enron and why? Why did Enron fired me and two months later started hiring
 two others for the same position? How can such a big company like Enron be
 so unreasonalble and why not to say insensitive?
 
 Sorry for this emotional words but I had to say that. I know you might not
 even  read this message but I had to try, specially because I did believe i=
 n
 RICE and I felt I had found out a company where the speech did correpond to
 the action, but unfortunately...
 
 Thank you for giving me a little piece of your time and wish success for th=
 e
 company because I still have friends working very hard there and they reall=
 y
 like it as I did once.
 
 Thanks a lot for your attention.
 Ana Cristina Carvalho dos Santos
