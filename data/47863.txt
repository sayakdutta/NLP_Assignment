 Good morning ladies:
 
 Mary asked that I coordinate a lunch with you next week and after looking at 
 her calendar, she is available either Thursday, May 31, 2001 or Friday, June 
 1, 2001.  Please let me know your availability so that I can make 
 reservations at Dong Ting for 12:00 p.m.
 
 Thanks.
