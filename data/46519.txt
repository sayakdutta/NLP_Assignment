 
 Just an FYI
 
 About a year ago Kellie Metcalf had me send a sample ISDA Master to the 
 referenced counterparty.  She has now left ECT to go with Azurix.  I got a 
 call from the counterparty wanting to get some bids on some options and 
 Kellie said to pass the trade down to John Suarez.  I called John and gave 
 him the scoop and also told him we did not have a master in place and to 
 treat this like any other counterparty, i.e. contact Credit for approvals 
 before trading, etc.  I just wanted to give you a head's up, in case we get 
 the trade, we're not surprised.
