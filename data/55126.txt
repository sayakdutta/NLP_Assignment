 Vince, 
 
 Next weekend (Sunday 27) I will be in Houston. I would be happy to pay a 
 visit to you and your family in the Woodlands, on the day and time you 
 prefer. I am very flexible in my daily schedule, and I am always honored to 
 make acquaintance with a Stanford scholar...
 
 Regards,
 
  Giuseppe
