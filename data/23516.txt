 John, Jim,
 
 are we happy for Clifford Chance to act commercially on the other side of the table from Enron. I have no problem with this from my side.
 
 I'd be grateful to hear from you. This appears to be urgent for CC.

 Dear Mark,
 
 Do you have any news re our acting for a client in acquiring an equity stake
 in Wessex Water? I am being chased by my partners about obtaining clearance
 for them to act.
 
 Please excuse me for in turn chasing you about this; I certainly appreciate
 that you will have more important matters at your hands to deal with these
 days, but for us accepting or refusing mandates from clients or would-be
 clients time is of the essence; I am sure that you will understand this.
 
 With best regards
