 
 I'm metal 
 & I am steel
 I don't mind
 cause I can't feel a thing
 I'm a diamond ring
 
 I'm not flesh 
 & I'm not bone
 I'm not sad & I'm
 not all alone
 I'm a stone
 
 the king is dead
 and the queen has flown
 left me here in the
 twilight zone - 
 lost and looking for
 a way to get back home
 
 and there's no right
 and there's no wrong
 so I'll be good 
 and I'll be strong
 
 I'll be silver &
 I'll be gold
 without a heart
 without even a soul
 I'll be coal
 
 I won't be blood &
 teeth and skin & 
 I won't feel the 
 pain I'm in 
 I'll be tin 
 with no heart within
 
 the king is dead
 and the queen has flown
 left me here in the
 twilight zone - 
 lost and looking for
 a way to get back home
 
 and there's no right
 and there's no wrong
 so I'll be good 
 and I'll be strong
