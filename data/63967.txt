 We've never used the CEMS data, so I don't know anything about its level of 
 accuracy. As far as use of the WSCC data goes, I noticed that you've got 
 table entries and are showing '0' values for a  lot of plants that have never 
 reported reliably, such as Hermiston, Gadsby, Priest Rapids, Wanapum, etc.-- 
 I'd leave those out until we see some plausible data reported. Also, we don't 
 use data from plants where better numbers are available from other sources, 
 e.g. most Pacific Northwest federal hydro.
 
 Also, are you doing anything to filter out bad hours? There are intermittent 
 periods where series of zeros or series of identical readings are erroneously 
 reported due to telemetry failures. If you're computing totals or averages 
 from the WSCC data that are consistently smaller than known, accurate 
 reports, then this might be the cause.

 Enclosed is a copy of the generation reports we put together using your 
 generation database.  Please look them over and make sure that they are in 
 the correct order an make sense.  Some of the monthly averages in the report 
 do not match the CEMS database number.  I wanted to know if I should fill in 
 the historicals with the CEMS numbers or keep these.  If you could just look 
 these over and let me know if they make sense I would appriciate it.
