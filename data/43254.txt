 Per discussions with Wade, we understand that the transfer notice should be given this weekend.  Given the potential for this to add to the stories about Enron, we plan to get review and support for or communication strategy from investor relations and corporate communications in advance of this activity.  Consequently, attached is a proposed statement that Johan, Jimmy and I prepared.  Your early comments and approval would be appreciated.  As soon as we have an approved text, we will share it with our corporate contacts and also intend to alert them to this possibility today.
 
 Thanks,
 
 John
