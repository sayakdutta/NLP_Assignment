 definitely invited.  And as for my family and friends, if you think you can 
 stand them you're welcome to come along.  Some of my friends usually end up 
 at my parents house anyway.  There's only one friend that'll I'll probably 
 try to catch up with over Thanksgiving and we usually just go to dinner and 
 catch a movie, so you are welcome to come.  
 
 What'cha doing for lunch?

 Robin, 
 
 I thought you were just being polite and you felt bad because it was going to 
 be a lonely Thanksgiving for me.  So, you were serious about it?   I really 
 appreciate that you still keep me in mind, and I apologize for not having 
 told you anything. I am sure you probably need to know to plan ahead. 
 Ok, here is the plan. Let me make a few phone calls b/c  my best friend  from 
 Cd. Juarez (border with El Paso, TX) said he  was going to Austin for that 
 weekend  but nothing is for sure. Also, Ramiro was planning a trip, but I 
 don't feel that bad If I decline b/c you know he loves finding foreigners to 
 travel with. He actually already found somebody.   
 
 Honestly, I did think about it, and I was a little worried that maybe you 
 want to spend quality time with family and friends and I will be a perfect 
 stranger there. (Ok, here is your chance to say "yeahh,  maybe you are right" 
 "I want to spend time with my F & F)  Or if you are still being polite, then 
 let me get bactk to you on that after I make those phone calls. 
 
 THank you.
 
 Gabriel
