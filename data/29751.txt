 
 I have not been able to find out any details except that apparently he 
 decided long ago that he would take some time off after becoming a partner 
 and so now he is going to do it.
 
 I have never received a call from Bob Draggon.  Should I still be expecting 
 one or have you already convinced him?
 
 Dan Castagnola is being requested as my replacement on Cuiaba and Peter 
 Anderson is also being discussed.  I will be involved primarily to provide 
 history and guidance, but it will be from my home or parts unknown.  You can 
 feel free to call me at any time (281-334-2360).  I will be in the office 
 here thru March 1.
 
 Kindest Regards
 
 Rob
 
    
 
 
 
 

   
  
 
 What's with John?  Is he OK?
