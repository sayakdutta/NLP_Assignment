 As Tana mentioned in our meeting, the Credit guys are in discussions with 
 Aspect as to who should be the counterparty to the swap (we think it should 
 be JEDI, they think it should be ECT).
 
 There is a master agreement in place between JEDI I and Inland (which 
 suggests that there is probably a swap in place that maybe should have been 
 transferred and still binds JEDI I).
