 harder now that John Stevens is on his way to San Francisco.
 
 At last week's meeting, a request was made for peak and off peak prices.  
 I've attached prices that we filed yesterday at FERC as part of its on-going 
 proceeding of forward contracts.  Few comments:  
 
 We'd appreciate it if you could keep the information confidential, 
 particularly since the information is covered by FERC's confidentiality 
 provisions.
 
 Since we are not a "generator," we buy and sell in the market, which as you 
 know is currently very volatile. Consequently, the quotes that we provide 
 customers change daily to reflect changing market prices.  These prices were 
 put together and filed yesterday, but you may have heard that prices were 
 down today.  So quotes we made today were lower.   And quotes we makes 
 tomorrow will reflect tomorrow's market conditions and will likely be 
 different from today's.
 
 Because these quotes were assembled yesterday, they are only "indicative."  
 That is, if someone wanted to buy these products today, we'd have to 
 recalculate prices, because the quotes established yesterday are no longer 
 valid (for the reasons I mentioned above).
 
 Hope this helps.  If you have any questions, let me know.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
