 Thanks,

 I'm going to shave my team name in the back of my mullet. 
  

   Ack!! Trying to catch up here after several days of vacation.  Quite a 
 meandering collection of emails.  You should get your tee shirts and why 
 not go the whole 9 yards and get custom license plates... take pride in 
 your losing streak!!  Unfortunately I don't think I can make the game 
 tonight, but Thursday or Friday for an xbox demo would be cool.
