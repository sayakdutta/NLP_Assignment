 Thanks for the message - it was great to see you yesterday.  Sam is fine - the doctor thinks some steroids would help.  Yuk.  Did you like Dr. Injac?  My kids love him.  I'm leaving in about an hour and will not be back until the middle of next week but will write then and we can set up a time for lunch.  Talk to you soon.

 Hi Liz,
  
 It was fun catching up with you at  Dr.Injak's.  Like you, I married a geologist (my dad and brother-in-law are  also geologists).  It's a nice change from lawyers.  
 I hope Sam is doing OK.  What did the doctor  say to do for him?
 Let me know what your schedule is like and we can  meet some time.  I'm fairly flexible, but have a nanny only 2 days per  week, so the rest of the time Connor is with me.  My little  shadow.
  
 Ciao,
 Kathy Ellis Cook
