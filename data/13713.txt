 Michelle;
 I have been working quite closely with Valeria these past few weeks on many difficult HR issues.  I wanted to let you know, that she is wonderful to work with.  Her calm, professional demeanor is a real asset in these times.  
 
 Valeria has a difficult, but critical role here at Enron.  I consider her a true partner to my generalist duties.
 
 Thanks
 Judy
