 I haven't heard from credit.  Why don't you call Tana Jones (our EOL 
 paralegal specialist) at 713-853-3399 and let her know that you want to 
 pursue the Electronic Trading Agreement and GTC's for online trading.  I will 
 also provide Tana with the background discussion that you and I had.  At 
 least she can get you moving on EOL and pursue credit at the same time.  Let 
 me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

 Sara,
 
 Per our discussion on February 6th, I was wondering if you had any feedback
 from your credit people regarding the five Enron-Hess entity ISDAs we
 discussed.  Also, as I mentioned in the February 6th e mail to you, Amerada
 Hess Corporation would like to be able to trade on Enron On-Line
 immediately.  Can you give me a call to discuss how soon we can make
 arrangements for this?
 
 
 Thanks,

 Mark,
 
 I would like to contact you in order to follow up to your conversation of
 last week with Mr. Chuck Cerria regarding executing an ISDA between
 numerous
 Hess entities and numerous Enron entities.  Unfortunately, I do not have
 your phone number.  Could you either call me or e mail it to me?
 
 Thanks so much,
