 this memo below) but I do not want all 12 - do you guys want to share in this 
 allocation?

 MEMORANDUM

 * Please Post for those without Email *
 TO:             Employees of Opus One, Robert Mondavi and Baron Philippe de 
 Rothschild 
 FROM:   Peter Ventura 
 RE:             E&G Purchases of Opus One 
 
 While demand for Opus One has grown significantly, case production has 
 remained level if in fact not declined-and will decline further for the 1998 
 vintage. This has lead to very strict allocations in the marketplace and a 
 need to conserve. 
 Please note as of March 1, 2001, for all employees and growers of Opus One, 
 Robert Mondavi Winery and Baron Philippe de Rothschild, purchase limits on 
 the current vintage of Opus One will change from twelve to six 750 ml. 
 bottles per person.  We expect to offer the current vintage, the 1997, until 
 October of this year, at which time the 1998 will be released.
 Thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation.
