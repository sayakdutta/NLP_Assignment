 
 Sorry for the overreaction on Fri. I was having a very bad hair day. It see=
 ms like no harm, no foul. I need you to keep your finger on the pulse on th=
 is issue. I called Zach Starbird( Mirant) about the issue and he was surpri=
 sed that Mirant had voted in favor. Can you call Brian Holman and see where=
  they stand. If you know any of the other attys well enough, please call th=
 em and lobby them also.I am in South America this week, but would like to b=
 e on the conf. call thurs. Can you make sure I have the #s.
 
 
 With respect to the PX settlement, I am an unenthusiastic supporter. Please=
  let me know if the proposal changes.
 
 
 
 
  


  
 Richard, sorry about the mix up.  The damage has been undone with a call to=
  Weg and Cohen changing our vote to a loud no.  I apologize.  I really don'=
 t want to be out in front of the client, particularly in a case in which I =
 myself cringe at the creative ways lawyers are coming up with to keep thems=
 elves busy.  When I couldn't reach you before the committee conference, I c=
 alled Lisa to ascertain whether she still was in the PX loop.  We talked ab=
 out the committee call.  She actually participated for the first few minute=
 s to express her view that our committee should not be filing in formal mot=
 ion to expand the PG & E committee.  We briefly discussed the arbitration i=
 ssue, and she did not appear adverse to commencement of the arbitration.  M=
 aybe that wasn't formal clearance to vote.  Lesson learned.  I want to avoi=
 d any such problem in the future.  Unless I hear otherwise from you, on sub=
 stantive issues I won't vote until I clear positions with you personally.  =
 However, we have to find a better way for me to get your take on particular=
  points because they will continue to arise as Weg and Cohen (not to mentio=
 n other attorneys who participate on the committee) urge the committee to t=
 ake actions in the interest of discharging our fiduciary duty.  Case in poi=
 nt, the Weg settlement.  Have you decided whether to withdraw the approval =
 you previously communicated.  If it would help the communication, I'm perfe=
 ctly willing to talk with you evenings or weekends.  Then again, you wife m=
 ight react like mine if her privacy at home is interrupted.  In any event, =
 assuming that Enron wants to stay on the committee, probably a good idea ju=
 st to reign in the lawyers, let me know how we can most effectively communi=
 cate so that I know your position and can convey it when you are not availa=
 ble for a call.  Incidentally, with you impending trip, feel free to call m=
 e over the weekend at 626-683-7644 if you want to discuss this further.  Bo=
