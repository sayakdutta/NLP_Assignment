 Cyrus/Julie,
 
 Can you please coordinate with Jamie White at ITG on this install.  I don't 
 really care how I get it.  I would presume that someone in our IT group 
 worked with ITG to determine the best delivery method on the original 
 install.  If so, please use the same architecture.  If not, please consider 
 the options and if we think there exists a better method than the one being 
 in Houston, let's upgrade the one in Houston concurrently with the London 
 install so the two sites are in synch.
 
 This install will initially be for European equity trading only but we may 
 want to incorporate US equities at a later date as well.  Any activity on 
 this setup will be governed by the same agreements currently in place as it 
 will be done on behalf of both ECT Investments and Enron North America until 
 further notice.
 
 Thanks and regards,
 John

 John
 Is this for European or US equities or both ?
 Do you want to trade using Internet access or would you prefer a fixed link 
 leased line ?
 If you could let me know
 Thanks
 Cyrus

 Cyrus,
 
 Can you please arrange for this installation on my desktop.  Please 
 coordinate with Julie Pechersky and Jamie White to ensure that my setup has 
 the same functionality as Selena Gonzales in Houston.
 
 Thanks and regards,
 John
