 
 Sorry Jim,
 
 I don't really have much interest in selling the M3 and TZ6 index for those time periods (let alone any better than I quoted) and the CNG Index numbers came from Brad McKay where his two-way was .0175/.025 on both terms.  He is not in today and I am covering for him, and I will not be improving his offers in his absence.
 
 Regards,
 
 Jon
