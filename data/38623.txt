 Can we add PG&E Topock and Mojave Topock index points to the NCD locations?  
 I think we discussed that they can't be added because of their association 
 with Socal curves.  Let me know.
 
 Also, can we add the new rockies index locations to the NCD sheet?  It would 
 be nice to see these locations broken out in detail.
