 Hi Chris,
 
 We have done a cash allocation of $7011.69 that was sitting in your RRSP as
 cash.  I will fax you the form to sign and you can fax it back to me.  There is
 also $3570.89 cash sitting in your Locked-In RSP- we will allocate that near
 the end of the month when a new fund from Mackenzie is released- Brad wants to
 put some of this $ into it (Growth Trends).  Please e-mail a good time to fax
 this to you so it is not laying around the office at your end.  Thanks.
 
 Lee
