 non-exclusive jurisdiction in Ohio.

 Mark:
 
 I am reviewing a CA that has an Ohio choice of law provision and an Ohio 
 exclusive jurisdiction provision, although this latter provision would only 
 apply to any injunction actions since the CA has our standard arbitration 
 provision.  The opposing side has already rejected New York as the governing 
 law.  Can we live with Ohio?
