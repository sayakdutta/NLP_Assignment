 I wanted to let you know you have read-only access to the CWI for viewing
 your lossess, ancillary services and transmission information.  However,
 when you log in now, you will need to use your current user id but your
 password has been reset to default.  Type in default as your password and
 then you will be prompted to enter a new password.  After you do this, you
 will then have read-only capability.  If you have any questions, please let
 me know.  I'm at 360.418.2009

 You also will have read-only access now but you will not be prompted to
 change your password.  We did the change under a blanket authority so it
 only requires Cara to change hers.  You should be able to continue to use
 your current user id and password and be fine.  If you have any questions,
 please let me know.  
 
 Thank you,
