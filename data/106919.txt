 to exclude "other Transactions" and limit setoff to derivatives only.  
 Unfortunately, I don't have the form with me.  SS

 I have forwarded to Marie Heard by interoffice mail a copy of deal NA1573.1.  
 Whomever is available to review this confirm please check   Annex  A , page 
 2, paragraph #5, line #5;  c/p added the word "derivatives" between the words 
 "such - amount".  Back on 3/3/1999  legal  did  not  approve  this  same 
 request  by these same counterparties.  Has  there been any  change in this 
 opinion?  I  am  currently  holding every executed confirm received from 
 these counterparties because  of  this  discrepancy.  Please advise asap.  
 Thanks,  Willie, 3-9226
