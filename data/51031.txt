 Vince,
  Linda Vargo asked me because I am the administrator of employee referral 
 program to contact you on whether or not Li Xiao is eligible for a bonus on 
 his referral of Alex Huang.  I have informed Linda that the decision up to 
 you.  If you feel that Alex Huang was hired as a result of Li bringing him to 
 the attention of Enron then the bonus is due.  Linda and yourself have 
 communicated via e-mail on this issue in early February and it appears from 
 that correspondence that Li did encourage Alex to e-mail his resume to you.  
 Please advise as to whether or not you want to award the bonus.
 
 Thank You
