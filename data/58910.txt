 
 This is great.
 Rick, Jim and Elizabeth, we should look at something like this for the rest of the organization.
 
  
     
 
 The new EHS web site has now been launched. 
 
 It is new and improved with increased functionality and usability. You can now go to the homepage and find the latest EHS and Corporate Responsibility news, as well as the latest documents posted to the site. Also, the homepage displays events and initiatives that are currently taking place within EHS.
 
 In addition, the site contains a section that covers Global EHS regulatory and legislative information. This service is provided by EnHeSa, a global EHS consulting group. This section provides a legislative and regulatory calendar, legislation and regulations that could directly impact Enron and some analysis of these impacts. You can reach this section at http://ehs.corp.enron.com/Main.asp?Topic=EnvStratRescs&SubTopic=6&Ecobytes=   
 
 You can go to the site with this URL: http://ehs.corp.enron.com
