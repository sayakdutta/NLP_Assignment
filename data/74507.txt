 
 Could you send me whatever you think is appropriate so I can get it in front of the lenders?
 
 Thanks,

 Kay,
 
 The revised JVD opinion has him opining as to non-contravention issues with respect to The Portland General Pledge Agreement.  He shouldn't be giving this opinion.  His opinion was originally limited to due authorization only.  This is problematic.

 thanks.
 
 Do you need anything else from me at this time?
