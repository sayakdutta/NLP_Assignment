 Darron,
 
 I have setup the new pipe/zone  Wildhorse Energy Partners with WHEP/WHEP 
 which Jackie requested.  I need to know how you would like this mapped.
 
 Pipe  Zone  Mid-Market  Intramonth  Gas Daily
 WHEP  WHEP      ???         ???       ???
 
 Please let me know as soon as possible because the pipe is now ready for 
 selection in SITARA.  I would like to setup the curve mappings before it is 
 put into use.
 
 Chao!

 George, we need a new trade zone added for a new pipe (Wildhorse Energy 
 Partners, LLC)
 
 Pipe Code:   WHEP
 Trade Zone: WHEP
 
 The scheduler is Jaqueline Adams at X33918.  She agrees that the trade zone 
 can be the same as the pipe code.
 
 Please let me know as soon as this zone is added, so that I may get started 
 on added all the meters.
 
 
 Thanks,
 Faye
