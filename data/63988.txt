 
 for new year's i am going to stay in houston.  i was going to new orleans but 
 i don't feel like making the drive now.  it is fairly dead at work for me 
 too.  what are you doing in sf again?  sf is such a cool city.  do a lot of 
 your friends from oregon live there?  i will check out that web site today.
