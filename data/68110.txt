 yes 21st is cool.  Just use this as a time to help out and do any projects that come up and use up all of your vacation - doubt it will be there to carryover.  As far as I know, our employment status has not changed - we have made no changes to the "list".  I would not worry for now.

 FYI - and you will also have to continue to calc physical books - deals not moved from those calcs yet - value and position.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 The only books that should still have deals in them, other than NG-Price, will be 
 
 Intra-Ont-Cad		all canadian gas daily deals
 NGPR-Can
 Oil-NG-Spec
 Ft-Ont-Central		all consolidated price/basis deals
 
 these books will still have to be calculated after today.
 
 All counterparty deals were moved over the weekend but any remaining desk to desk deals were not touched.  We need to move those ourselves today.
 All others need to be calculated and officialized one more time today then inactivated on the Rac website for tomorrow.
