 These look fabulous!  Thanks, I'll let you know when I cook them!

 For all my chef friends. It is known that I do not cook (by popular demand) but, I had to share the below recipes with you guys.  I went to a dinner Sunday night and both items were served.  
 The praline sauce was served with pork tenderloin (which was healthy), potatoes and green beans.  Feel free to also enjoy Sherri's comments.  Enjoy.

 Debbie, thanks so much for the recipes.  I think Rebecca is going to use
 both of them, so will let you know what the group thought.
 
 I'm copying Julie, too, because she also thought dinner was fantastic.
 She's going to share these recipes with some of her "friends that cook" -
 obviously they're not for her personally ;-).  (No offense, Jules - I'm only
 keeping them on file for Eddie as I'm no cook, either!)
 
 Thanks again for everything, Debbie.  SRS
