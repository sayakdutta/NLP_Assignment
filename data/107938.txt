 
 I'm going to NY late tomorrow night for the holiday party there, and then am 
 going to wyoming to hang out for a few days, and I can't wait...I'd like to 
 catch up when you have time....

 I'm glad I can have my life back, for awhile at least.  Our group is moving 
 next week.  We're going to the 47th floor with Shelley Corman's group.  My 
 former boss, Dave Schafer has joined Cindy Olson's group.  
 
 I'm spending christmas with my family.  We're having fireworks.  Doesn't that 
 sound like fun.  Are you going away for the holidays?
