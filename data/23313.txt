 To my friends and colleagues:=20
         After 27+ years with Houston Pipe Line Company (under the successiv=
 e ownership of HNG, InterNorth, Enron, and now AEP), I've decided to try so=
 mething different.  As of September 30, I will no longer be getting up and =
 driving downtown to work every day.  Much has happened in 2001, on personal=
 , family, professional, national, and global levels, which has induced me t=
 o act on my inclination to retire (I've been thinking about it ever since I=
  got that solicitation from AARP).  There is much that I will miss (daily c=
 amaraderie with co-workers and colleagues, challenging work, interesting pr=
 ojects, a paycheck), but there are other things that I can do without (rush=
  hour traffic, cumbersome regulations, long hours, irreconcilable conflicts=
 , office politics, tedious paperwork, seemingly endless meetings, payroll d=
 eductions).  On balance, it looks like a fair trade.=20
         I have enjoyed the very good fortune of having a challenging and sa=
 tisfying career, and of having been able to do so in the company of many wo=
 nderful people.  I want to take this opportunity to thank everyone for your=
  friendship and support over the years, for contributing to my never-ending=
  education, and for being a valued part of my experiences and memories.  Th=
 ere have been a lot of good times, and some less good times, but I wouldn't=
  want to start all over again and see how it turns out next time around.  I=
  am enormously grateful for all of my many blessings, and hopefully the sam=
 e is true for you.  =20
         My general plan for right now is to contemplate the future and my p=
 lace in it, which sound pretty good to me -- both the process of contemplat=
 ion as well as the future itself.  I do intend to find some arguably produc=
 tive and/or fun ways to spend my new otherwise idle time, and finding out w=
 hat those may be should be half the fun.  Perhaps the biggest concern is ho=
 w long Linda will be able to tolerate my not getting up and leaving the hou=
 se every weekday morning, but she's at the church a lot of the time anyway.=
   I'm sure the boys are wondering how my being around the house more will a=
 ffect their tranquility and privacy, and that remains to be seen, although =
 I doubt that I'll be hanging out with them and their friends very much anyw=
 ay.=20
         One of my specific resolutions as we go forward is to do a better j=
 ob of keeping up with friends.  The wonders of e-mail will facilitate that =
 endeavor, but I will also be available in person for lunches, happy hours, =
 tee times, dinners, movies, and other consultations. I already know where t=

 com; 3507 Plumb, Houston, TX 77005; phone 713-665-5315; and fax 713-665-741=
 0.  As time goes on, I may self-indulgently send e-mail updates; if you con=
 sider them "spam," you know where the "Delete" button is.=20
         Linda and I will be out of town on a trip to New England next week,=
  but when we return I will commence a substantially different way of life. =
  I am eagerly anticipating whatever the future may hold.  Like most people,=
  I'm anxious to spend more time with my family (they may be a little anxiou=
 s about that, too).  Myriads of exciting new opportunities and challenges u=
 ndoubtedly await, and I'm looking forward to discovering and pursuing many =
 of them.  The list of things I want or need to do is already quite long, an=
 d will likely grow even faster than I can check things off the list.=20
         As for the very immediate future, I'm going to click on "Send," pic=
 k up my briefcase, and head for the elevator.  We have to get ready to go t=
 o Brian's volleyball tournament in Dallas tomorrow.  So long for now, best =
 wishes, and see ya around.
