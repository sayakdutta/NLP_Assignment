 
  I just received the e-mail regarding your visit to Portland (Monica Lande 
 forwarded it to me). Regarding that, I would definitely be interested in 
 gaining access to Livelink. Monica explained that Livelink is a system that 
 allows one to view confirms, in which case it would greatly benefit my 
 position to have access to it. I look forward to your visit, and to working 
 with you in the future.
 
 Thanks,
