 FYI,
 
 Connie Sutton is no longer the Contracts Manager, she has taken a position 
 with Enron Networks.  Please remove her from all Financial Contract 
 distribution and please replace her with the new manager Linda S. Bryan.  
 Linda is in the process of moving, so I cannot provide her EB location, but 
 she is at ex. 3-3538.  These changes are to made effective immediately!
 
 Thank You all for your attention,
 Anthony
