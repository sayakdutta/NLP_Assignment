 
 What an awful mess.
 
 
 
 
 

   
  
 We also used CompareRite.  However, when the system swithched over the
 weekend, our current tool bars no longer work with Word as presently
 configured. In addition, those documents that had automated headings.
 etc. now are incompatible with the new versions.  We are having an
 outside vendor try to clean the documents up so that they will be
 compatible and Houston IT is working on fixing our tool bars.
 
     
 
 
 I've found CompareRite to work with long documents.  Plus, these
 documents
 started out as WordPerfect documents and were converted to Word, which I
 think creates problems with Word comparisons.  I figure it is a Gates
 conspiracy...
