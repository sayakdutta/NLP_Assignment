 me...I don't know where Michelle is.  She should be in town.  She must just 
 be busy at work.

 Why are you responding without responding? Do you know where Michelle is. I
 think she's hiding.

 Thanks! I think I can meet you on Friday and I did some research and found a
 thermostat that switches automatically.

 I'll leave you a check tomorrow.  Also, I'm taking Friday afternoon off to
 meet the stove repair guy.  Can you meet me there to do house & yard clean
 up day?

 Hi Tana, did you get the money situation taken care of. Please let me know.
 I do have a payroll to meet.
 
 Thanks
