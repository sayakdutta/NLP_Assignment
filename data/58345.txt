 some influence, but I don't trust him to keep our strategy and contacts 
 confidential.

 Today, I spoke with EPSA's outside counsel, Andy Zausner, about having his 
 firm's Senior Counsel former Senator Wendell Ford (D-Ky, 1974-98) assist us 
 with our FERC "Linda Breathitt" Strategy.  Former Senator Ford knew Linda's 
 father well plus has dinner with Linda every several weeks or so.  There 
 probably isn't anyone in Washington closer to Linda than Wendell as he has 
 known her since she was a child.  Andy is expecting either Steve's or Rick's 
 phone call to further discuss the Senator's involvement.  Andy did discuss in 
 general that he wasn't certain whether his client, EPSA, would go along with 
 the strategy but he thought, overall, it was a possibility.  Andy's direct 
 number is 202-828-2259.  I know Andy and Wendell very well and would like to 
 be helpful as you wish.  However, at this point, I thought an EPSA board 
 member (i.e. Steve or Rick) should follow up.  thanks.
