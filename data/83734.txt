 
 How are we planning to handle daily volume swings on the 30% priced at Gas 
 Daily and which group will hold this risk?  
 Which group will handle nominations/scheduling/balancing on the gathering 
 system?

  Continental Land & Fur 58 #2 Well

 Eric & John
 
 Enron NA is currently purchasing wellhead gas from the referenced well on 
 Transco on a month-to-month basis pursuant to Sitara #415772.  We believe 
 Enron Upstream may have an opportunity to firm up this purchase for at least 
 a year and perhaps 2 years.  It appears ENA is currently paying a $0.0787 
 transport rate along with 4.5% fuel to Transco; the well is producing between 
 18,000 and 19,000 Mmbtu/d.
 
 Could you please get us a quote to purchase this wellhead gas on a firm basis 
 based on the following:
 
 1 year term
 or
 2 year term, commencing 11/1/2000
 
 firm purchase and firm transport for 70% of the wellhead volume, starting at 
 70% of 18,000 per day and declining as will be defined by our Reserve 
 Department
 
 gas daily purchase and interruptible transport for the remaining 30% of the 
 wellhead volume
 
 Enron Upstream will keep the desk financially whole should volumes for the 
 70% firm component fail to show up on any given day of the 1 year or 2 year 
 term
 
 Eric, you have advised you will not be available at 3:30 today; John, would 
 you please join us in 3271 today at 3:30 to talk about the mechanics of 
 pricing and ticketing the deal described above.  Thanks.
