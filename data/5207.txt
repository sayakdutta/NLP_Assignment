 MESSAGE OF THE DAY:
 
                 Too often, we lose sight of life's simple pleasures.
                 Remember, when someone annoys you it takes 42
                 muscles in your face to frown BUT, it only takes 4
                 muscles to extend your arm and bitch-slap the
                 mother fucker upside the head...
