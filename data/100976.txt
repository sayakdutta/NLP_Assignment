 
 The offer still stands but the location has changed...We're meeting at the 
 Gingerman instead of Kenneally's (so alas no pizza - but oh, what a selection 
 of beer).

 Hey Darren,
 
 I haven't forgotten that I still owe you a birthday beer.  In fact, Ted was 
 kind enough to point out my failure to do so and add to my already heavy 
 feelings of guilt.  Anyway, I know you guys are working hard getting your 
 presentation ready, but if you need a break I'm planning on meeting a friend 
 at Kenneally's tonight for a little pizza and beer.  Let me know if you have 
 any interest in collecting...if not, you can just hold on to your raincheck 
 until another time.
 
 Susan
