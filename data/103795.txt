 We have just completed a nightmare negotiation involving a confirmation with 
 this counterparty and propose entering into an English law ISDA Master with 
 them to avoid future problems.  I understand that one is already in existence 
 between this c/p and ECT.  I suggest that we could mirror this and send it to 
 the cp as a starter.  If you think that this would be appropriate please 
 could you send me a copy of the Duke/ECT Schedule, CSA and any guaranties.
 
 Have a great weekend.
 
 Many thanks
 Michael
