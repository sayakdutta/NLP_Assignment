 Mike and Jeff,
 
 We're planning to meet with XL Capital in NYC on Thursday to discuss 
 EnronCredit.com.  John S. suggested I notify the two of you and (a) inform 
 you of the meeting and (b) determine whether there was any outstanding 
 litigation between XL and ENE due to the weather derivatives team.
 
 Regards,
 John
