 letter or stepping on his toes. Jim overreacts at times.

 I don't know what precipitated the onslaught of questions, but as Corporate 
 Risk Management is the business charged with the responsibility of dealing 
 with United India, one of only four Indian insurance companies, and because 
 we have a sizable book of business there and anticipate more,  I need to be 
 brought into the loop on what the problem is or what the allegations are 
 about. I believe that I am aware of all of the lawsuits filed by various 
 Enron entities against insurance companies since 1986, and only one of those 
 was filed in Texas.  I believe that Michelle has already addressed that 
 issue.  Someone please advise me or Jim Bouillion what this is about.
