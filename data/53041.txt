 
 Frank,
 
 Thanks for your message.
 
 What about a meeting on Tuesday, September the 4th.
 We could meet at your office, let's say at 4 p.m. We would be delighted if you
 could join us for dinner later in the evening on the same day.

 Vince,
 
  I'll be out of the country for the next
 two weeks, but should be back September 3
 and will be in the office all that week.
 
 Frank
