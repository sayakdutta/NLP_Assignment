 
 FYI, 
 Please book all future GD priced tiered deals as two deals in sitara.  The 
 reason for this is eventhough we put a swap on the deal for the volume that 
 should be at index, the swap looks at the volume as a monthly volume as 
 opposed to a daily and gives the monthly volume to the desk at mid.  What 
 typically happens is the total volume for the first half of the month comes 
 to the desk entirely at mid.  This is causing some substantial OA variances.  
 If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.
