 
 With respect to the "amends":
 
 Calpine Power:  was already open for financial-no change to that approval
 
 Utilicorp.:  I originally had Enron sales only for power, but Leslie is now 
 telling me to open them for all power.
 
 Constellation:  I originally had them shut down for financial, so I am 
 opening them up.  I originally had them shut down for power and they should 
 stay shut down.
