  ISDA Agreement to Connectiv Energy Supply, Inc.  
 
 Please proceed with the assignment referenced above.  In terms of the ISDA 
 assignment and amendments, everything was satisfactory.  I do however, 
 recommend, if this hasn't already been done, that legal bless the guaranty 
 language by Conectiv.
 
 If you should have any comments or questions, please contact me at x5-7712.

  Tracy, as we have discussed, the CP's attorney wants to get this assignment 
 in place before the end of April.  The CP's attorney calls almost daily to 
 check the status of the assignment.   I know you are busy, but could please 
 take a look at this document today?   Thanks!
