 The "Confirmation" will be the actual written Confirmation, which confirms in 
 writing the terms of the deal agreed to on the phone.  I don't know if what 
 they're looking for is a form of Confirmation (not deal specific) of what a 
 Confirmation might look like if they did a trade, or if you actually have 
 done or are proposing a particular trade and need to see the Confirmation 
 filled in with the proposed deal terms.  I left Roni Cappadonna with Duke a 
 voicemail asking her which specifically she was looking for.  As soon as I 
 hear from her I'll get her what she needs.  If you have any more questions, 
 email me back, or call.  I'm at your service!
