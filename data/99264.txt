 Let's talk.  Can we shift some more of the cost to ETS???

 Great!  Now, what have you done for me lately?  The ETS entities are apparently still in this case and I'm feeling lonely already now that ENA is bugging out.  Where is our deal with Boies to get Quinn in and us out?  Thanks for the help on this Andy.  DF
 
  
     
 I am glad to report that we have received word from Rex Sharp, the plaintiffs' lawyer in the Quinque litigation, that he intends to dismiss Enron North America Corp. from this litigation.  We provided Rex with an affidavit explaining that ENA is not a first measurer of gas, and he let us know this morning that as a result, he does not intend to pursue ENA.  I will believe it when I see the amended petition, which should be filed by the close of business tomorrow.  
 
 I will keep you updated.
 
 Andy
