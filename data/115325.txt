 
 All Matt Motley's deal JUST went in, so you should see those coming through.
 
 Chris Mallory checked with Prebon - this is a sale - it's been changed.
 
 Diana checked Bloomberg - they show 25 mw and so do we for a total of 800 
 mw....??

 Enron buys Reliant 50 mw of Q3 SP-15 at $300
 Enron sells Williams 25 mw of April SP-15 at $203
 Enron sells El Paso 25 mw of June PV at $260
 Enron sells Williams 25 mw of March Mid-C at $255

 Prebon shows Enron as seller not buyer
 
 
 BLOOMBERG
 
 Diana Scholtes

 Bloomberg shows 800 total mw....we show 400 total mw...
 
 
 Thanks!
