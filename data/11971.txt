 
 I just spoke to the state of Arizona concerning the tree removal at Station 
 2.  Their response to our request to remove the trees has been APPROVED, 
 provided that this is the only pre activity  we do prior to receiving the air 
 permit.  This means that no other  construction or preparation activities can 
 be performed  or conducted untill the air permit has been issued.   This 
 approval also includes stump removal if need be......
 
 
    
  
 Larry -FYI    -Earl mentioned in the conference call that the State may 
 consider cutting down trees as construction activities and we may need to 
 hold off until we receive the air permit.

 HOld off on the tree cutting, till we hear from the state of Arizona.  Under 
 the regulations of the air permitting, we are not allowed to initiate any 
 kind of construction activity untill the air permit is received.  Cutting the 
 trees could be construed as initiating construction.......

 hey mike , how are you.
 I should be getting a "day/date" from Earl as to when to give the Forest 
 Service the date(s) for them to schedule their tree cutting.
 Ken Jacobs has asked me (TW) for a date/week.  The forest service will then 
 set up a crew and send them in.  Once the trees are cut, Ken will send me the 
 Tree Contract and invoice for those trees.
 
 I mentioned this to Donna Marten and Earl in last weeks conference call.
