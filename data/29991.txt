 
 I have been relying soley on Jose and Claudia for interpretations of the 
 relevant regs. I have not seen Enlish translations of the regs or the CCT & 
 CUST so I don't know how we get charged. I think Jose has some idea and I 
 seem to recall US$.0007/kw-hr but I don't have anything official.

 Jose and Rob- This note is short and sweet and seems to say what we want it 
 to say,i.e the changes in the transmission regs came after the PPA was 
 signed,this really is the responsibility of Furnas and any costs can be 
 recovered thru economic equillibrium. However ,I think we need to bolster the 
 change in law argument by referencing the section in the PPA , provide some 
 economic examples of the type of financial exposure to the project and 
 reference the sections in the operatin accord and ppa where Furnas is 
 responsible for all charges after the delivery points.Jose- please focus on 
 cleaning this document up today so we can deliver the note asap. The lenders 
 raised the delay in getting this note to them again last Friday.Rob- do you 
 have some calculations that you have done that everyone can review for 
 inclusion into the note.We also need your review of the note for correct spin 
 on how you want to deliver to the banks
