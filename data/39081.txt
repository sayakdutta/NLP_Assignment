 I have attached a planning schedule that I will be following in HR for the 
 1999 Bonuses and 2000 Merits.  Please remember that this schedule depends on 
 several parties so some deviations may occur.  I have also attached some 
 basic questions and answers that many employees ask.  Please call me at Ext 
 30649 or my assistant Irma at Ext 31543 if you have any questions or 
 concerns.  Also, I will ask you to pass this information to any of your 
 direct reports which may need it.
