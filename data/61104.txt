 
 let me talk to wes and find out really where this stuff is  -- it may be closer to ngpl perm -- i have no idea until i see the physical location
 
 
  
     
 Tori:  This is really a central issue, but they are asking us for the appropriate curves. I think they have been asked to move some old central deals from WNG Williams to WFSC\Perminan.  My suggestion is:
 
 intraminth Curve  - IF-ELPO/PERMIAN
 gas daily curve   -  GDP/ELPO/PERM2.
 
 Let me know what you think.  
 
 Thanks
 
 Anne
 
  
     
 deal ticket numbers are 139899 and 139900 with coinciding deals 309061 and  307072.

 I set up the new zone in Global, however before we can move any deals to this location it needs to mapped
 to a valid intramonth, long term and gas daily curve. Wes, can you or someone in risk let me know which curves?
 Perhaps it can be mapped like some other location that already exists.
 
 Thanks
