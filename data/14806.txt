 I bought the Louis Rich pre-cooked chicken & the caesar salad bowls (in plastic bowls - near fruit bowls) from Albertson.  Just added some extra parmesan.
 
 
     
 
 Hi Shelley: 
 I am helping to host a Girl Scout snack supper for 50 adults tomorrow evening, and I am thinking about making the grilled chicken salad like you made for the VBS planning meeting.  Can you tell me if you bought pre-cooked chicken, and if so where you got it?  Also, was that just romaine lettuce you used, or pre-mixed greens?  Did you toss a dressing in the salad, and if so, what kind? 
 (Sorry to bother you with this - if you don't have time to respond I totally understand!) 
 Thanks, 
 Barbara
