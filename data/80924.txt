 Mike,
 
 Previously, Fastow's group was scheduled to vacate floor 27 on the 24th of 
 August.  There were a few unexpected construction problems and now the vacate 
 date is September 8.
 
 Of course we are not moving to floor 27 "as is".   I expect the rest of the 
 month of September to be used for constructing floor 27 to our 
 specifications.  We can probably start moving down the first weekend in 
 October.  I'm requesting a very aggressive , around-the-clock, construction 
 crew. 
 
 I'll advise as necessary.
 
 Many Thanks,
 
 Liz
