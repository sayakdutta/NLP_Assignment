 
 Should we send out a new draft without changing the guaranty language from 
 the original draft?

 Hello Sara,
 
 I talked to Chuck Kaufmann in Cinergy's credit dept. concerning the ongoing 
 issues.  Basically, he has agreed to the cross-default levels of 50/100 
 million.  He is going to look further into the guaranty issue and get back to 
 me on this. I will keep you updated.
 
 
 
 Thanks
 Russell
