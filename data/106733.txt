 
 I don't know if you have spoken with Susan Flynn about her schedule 
 before/after her surgery, but I have some questions that you may have already 
 addressed, such as:
 
 Has Susan prepared a matrix reflecting the status of documentation (i.e., 
 existing masters, agreements to use ENA master/terminate counterparty 
 master,etc.) with the various CES counterparties?  Carol mentioned that she 
 could finalize this project.
 
 Will someone receive be checking Susan's email and voice mail and physical 
 mail each day?
 
 What efforts (if any) are ongoing with respect to PGE?
 
 What about existing files?  Top Tens (Swiss Re)?  Any ISDA comparisons could 
 be accelerated by giving directly to attorneys.
 
 Who will prepare reports for legal/credit meeting?
 
 Who is entering year-end deals onto Lotus Notes?  Should Susan Bailey handle 
 per Carol's suggestion?
 
 I'm sure that everyone in the group would appreciate a better understanding 
 of how to handle the situation.  Thanks.  Sara
