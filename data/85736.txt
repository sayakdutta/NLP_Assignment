Please revise the CA to read "information in connection with sharing data relative to a potential electric compression project located approximately 3 miles west of Carthage, Texas in Panola, County".  Follow that form with the Duke CA as well.  Please prepare two executables of each.  Thanks for all your help.
 
 
  
     
 The Anadarko project is located approx 3 mi due west of Carthage, TX  in Panola Co. 
 The Duke project is located 2 mi NW of the town of Falfurrias in Jim Wells Co. TX
 
 Both projects contemplate an eletrical drive retrofit of existing gas compression facilities. The Anadarko project is 12,000 Hp and the Duke project is 20,000 Hp. 
 
 Let me know if you need any additional info. 
 
 Thanks
  
  
     
 Per my previous voice mail, could you please prepare CA's for both:  Anadarko Petroleum Corporation,  1200 Timberloch Place, The Woodlands, TX  77251 and Duke Energy Field Services,  5718 Westheimer, Ste 2000, Houston, TX 77057. As mentioned both CA's are for the purposes of data sharing relative to Elec. compression projects.
