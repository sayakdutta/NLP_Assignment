 
 Linda,
 
 Here is my very short list for the tournament.  My friend Melissa Reese has said she will volunteer.  Gas has been so crazy over the past week - I have been extremely busy!  Sorry I am so late.  I will continue to add or fill in blanks until you tell me I can't any more.  I have been asked if there is room for sponsors - I said yes to sponsoring teams. 
 
 I will also try to gather trinkets as I get a chance. 
 
 Keep in touch -
 
 thanks,
 
 Kim
