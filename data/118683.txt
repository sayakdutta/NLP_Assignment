 
 It turns out the initial auction product will not be the emissions credits 
 but rather the EnBank UK synthetic gas storage product.  They want this 
 auction to allow bids to be revoked or revised up until the end of the 
 auction period and not to have the ability to accept bids until the 
 expiration time.  There is still no commitment to sell anything.  All 
 transactions will be for sales by Enron to the counterparty.  I have taken a 
 stab at revising the procedures language with this in mind.
