 Below are the instructions and cover sheet for your expense reports and the 
 form that you need to use for your expenses.  Please be sure to follow all of 
 the instuctions or your report will be sent back to you and your payment 
 delayed.
 
 You do not need to code anything!  Everything is coded down here so you do 
 not have to know any numbers except your social security number and your 
 phone number.  Also, tape your receipts to a blank sheet of paper on ALL 4 
 SIDES.  If you have any questions you can call me at 3-0322.
 
 FYI - Milage is reimbursed at .325 cents to the mile.
 Thank you!!
