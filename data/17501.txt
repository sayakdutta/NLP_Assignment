 Thanks so much.  I'd almost given up hope.  I will be distributing the 
 proposal immediately and attempting to garner support industry-wide, across 
 the nation.  Can't make any promises of support, but will be working hard to 
 try to bring people together.  I'll be in touch soon.  Don't hesitate to 
 contact me to discuss it further.  415.782.7822.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
