 David,
 
 TVA's proposed credit assurance language should be amended to reflect our 
 standard language with the downgrade event being established at BBB- or 
 Baa3.  Also, your redline should also delete any subjectivity which provides 
 the TVA the unilateral right to call for additional or replacement 
 collateral.  In looking at historical agreements (i.e. master options 
 agreement), our standard credit provisions have been accepted.  I will 
 forward another email with their prefered gty form.  It appears that we 
 currently have outgoing gtys; however, they govern certain agreements like 
 the Master Options Agmt.  Comments or questions, please call.

 Dave and Ed,
 
 We closed two option deals with TVA last week.  They have sent the following 
 comments on our standard confirms. 
 
 Dave - Rogers has already commented on the 16 hour call.  His comment was 
 that this is a 16 hour call, all or none, not up to 16 hours.  Secondly, the 
 option is exercisable in 50 MW blocks (increments of 50MW) not a minimum of 
 50 MW.  Please look at the rest of the language and let me know your 
 thoughts.  Thanks.
 
 Ed-  there are some credit additions on page 3 under credit assurance.  Let 
 me know what you think.
 
 Thanks guys.
 
 -Joe
