 Alan,
 
 According to this site the cap was around $71 for HE 15 and $72 for HE 18.  We had already traded for these hours when the "new cap" had been set.  This is a retroactive cap during mitigation hours.  When trading in the hour ahead market (1 hour before energy flows) we cannot predict the Cap to Market ratio. For example: Expost is $18 right now, and the market is at $91.87.  Any recommendations?

 A fast way to see the MCP is under Energy Prices at http://www.caiso.com/.
 You'll notice that in hours 15, 16, 17 and 18 yesterday the MCP was set by
 the proxy price when we were in a Stage 1 then 2 Emergency.  Other hours
 were set by the previous Stage 1 cap.
