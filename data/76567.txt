 don't trust my memory.  Since there is so much to do in such a short time, 
 lists help!
 
 Thanks,

 Yes.  I will get these out to you either late tonight or early tomorrow.
 With regard to your earlier request for a closing list for moving the
 Turbines out of the West LB Agreement, what are you referring to that
 was not included in Chris Cobb's memo yesterday?

 Paul/Peter,
 
 Me again.  I have a meeting with ABB for Thursday.  Could you make me a
 list of issues like you did with the GE contract (removing the comments

 against
 the original master contract.
 
 Thank you,
 
 Kay
