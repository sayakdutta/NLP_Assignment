 
 John,
 
 I am writing to you regarding the management of the London Research group.
 
 As you know, Dale Surbey, who was managing the London unit of the Research 
 Group,
 is moving to EBS. Dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of 
 talent we have currently
 in London.
 Given that Dale is likely to be transfered to Houston,  it's time
 to nominate one member of the Research Group for a management position.
 
 
 My recommendation is Steve Leppard. Steve emerged not only as the most
 technically qualified member of the group  but also as a natural leader, 
 highly
 respected by his peers and internal customers.  Steve has a very high energy 
 level
 and is very efficient as a manager and as  coach of new talent.
 
 His promotion is likely to cause Anjam's departure form Enron. I value 
 technical
 skills of Anjam, but in spite of my loyalty to him, don't think he is the 
 same caliber
 as Steve. However, I would not like to lose him and think about moving him to 
 Houston
 for 2 years. I think that the opportunity to work in Houston, would be a 
 sufficient
 incentive to keep him in Enron. By the way, his performance feedback has 
 greatly improved.
 
 Please, let me know what you think.
 
 Vince
