 
 I think all of us who deal with assets are running across confidentiality 
 hurdles in all kinds of agreements, including confidentiality agreements.  In 
 short, our business people need the ability to disclose agreements to 
 potential purchasers of projects, contracts and assets, and not all of our 
 forms allow this.
 
 I'm trying to include an exception for "potential lenders and investors" 
 whenever I can (instead of just lenders). Does someone have a more artful or 
 effective solution?  
 
 Just wanted to share the thought so that more eyes could be watching for the 
 issue.
