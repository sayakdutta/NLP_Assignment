 with Enron Credit.com contracts being signed in the US.

 Mark, It seems to me Erica's advice needs to apply not only to this NDA, but 
 probably all of the NDA's that are going to originate from the Houston based 
 EnronCredit.com business team.  Further, it should apply not only to NDA's, 
 but their whole business they are originating from Houston, yes?  Maybe you 
 need to talk to Erica...

 Here is Erica's approval, as such - I have since explained what it is about 
 and she is happy with it
 Thanks

 I'm sorry for the delay.  I looked at the agreement and I have no problem 
 with it although, as a lawyer, it is dificult to envision how the English 
 courts are going to apply Texas law.  I would like to know what this is about 
 as I have no idea.  Can you please give me a call on 34916?  Thanks.
