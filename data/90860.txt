 
 i love you very much also and sometime i need to let you express your angst and try not to 
 get wrapped up in trying to make it all better but understand why you feel the way you do and work
 on myself and us as a partnership in life.

 seeing him or not is fine with me...I expressed my angst to you just now
 because that is what I felt at that moment. I am working VERY hard
 to change some of my behaviors to more productive ones for our relationship
 and in light of recent 'irrational' behavior on your part I just hope you devote the
 same effort and I KNOW that you are- I just forget the other avenues in which you do this
 I love you
