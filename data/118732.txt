 Dear Mark,
 
 Hope you are well!
 
 I've attached the confirmation for the EOL bankruptcy swaps where ENA will be 
 the contracting entity.  I've followed the format of the online ENA swap 
 confirm but kept the economics the same as for the European bankruptcy swap 
 confirm.  Please let me know if you are happy with this.  
 
 Thanks, Edmund.
