 These are revised schedules for Jan, Mar, &  Apr 2000 and the estimate 
 (scheduled) volumes for May.
 The prices were revised to capture Texas General storage revenue (fuel 
 retention) in Jan, Mar, & Apr.  The fuel volumes are shown as a zero buy 
 price for the storage book.
 The April also has volume true-ups due to actual metered volumes. (Schedule 
 6).  Another adjustment was made in April to true up the cumulative facility 
 balance, (4,295 mmbtu).
 
 Thanks,
 Kenny
