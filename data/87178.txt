 Debra,
 
 Attached is the requested electronic version of the WPSC contract and
 Corporate Guaranty sent to Enron 12/14.  Given the cold weather conditions,
 WPSC is very anxious to get this agreement executed.  Hopefully, given the
 time we all spent resolving contract issues, this contract can be executed
 and sent to WPSC this week.
 
 Please call me if you foresee any problem with this timetable.
 
 Thanks,
 Kim
