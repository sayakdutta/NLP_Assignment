 I think a cocktail dress would be wonderful.  I plan to wear something fairly festive myself!  I look forward to seeing you on Sunday!

 Hey, Paula and Kim.  
  
 Do you have any idea what the dress code for Sunday is going to be?  I know in the past with the party being at the building it's beem more casual holiday attire.  I didn't know if people would dress up more since it's at the Doctor's Club this year or not.  Would a cocktail dress be too much?  Let me know what you think.
  
 Thanks, Rene'
