 Hi Chris:
 
 I have spoken with Nella Cappelletto and Human Resources regarding your concerns parking at the Westin Hotel.  After discussing the issue, it has been determined that the Westin Hotel is the only available parking alternative until we are able to secure a stall at the Ernst & Young Tower in November.
 
 If you have any other questions, please feel free to call me at (403) 974-6700.
 
 Thank you,
