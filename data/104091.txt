 
 Sam:  Please get on my calendar for Friday.  We need to update agreements, 
 status, etc.  Also, we need to add a "Futures Agreement" designation to Lotus 
 Notes.  Please bring your latest printouts for existing agreements and 
 provide a copy for me.  Let's take about an hour.  Thanks.  Sara
 
 ps  Also, if you have any questions about masters, etc., bring them along!
