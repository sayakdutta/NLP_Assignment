 
 FYI,  Do we have any Peoples concerns here?
 
  
     
 
 Gerald - 
 This afternoon, the Compression team is headed to Chicago for a Friday meeting with Nicor.  We have not yet progressed to the point of providing Nicor a LOI.  Instead, one of the items they plan to discuss is the attached outline of the LOI in order to give Nicor an indication of what would be included if and when the deal progresses.  
 
 Could you review the attached LOI Outline and provide any comments?
 
  
 
 Thanks, Lisa Druzbik
