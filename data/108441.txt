 Guys - We need representation at a senior level from your groups.  Please get 
 your Directors and VP's to "volunteer" to help the AA Program out with 
 interviewers.  For example, the November 4 Super Saturday has only 13 Manager 
 and above level interviewers and there are 38 candidates from UT alone.  
 These candidates will become our next crop of AA's.  We control that with the 
 Super Saturday process.  Be represented - have your people sign up now 
 on-line (see below).  Thanks.  Ted
