 broker fee on the sale side of the sleeve. I ended up changing just two 
 deals; they're highlighted in red:
 
 459812 - no change (buy side of EES sleeve)
 459813 - added .0075 broker fee (sale side of EES sleeve)
 
 457489 - no change (buy side of EES sleeve)
 457490 - no change (sale side already contained .0075 broker fee)
 
 468444 - added .0075 broker fee (sale side)
 468440 - no change (buy side)
 
 And as a disclaimer - I'm getting my information from our traders, so if any 
 of this sounds incorrect, or if Natsource still disputes, please let me know.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate
