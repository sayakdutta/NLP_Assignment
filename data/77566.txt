 participate.  Sorry for  the short notice (what else is new). Perhaps we can 
 also arrange a discussion about the interconnection agreement.
 
 I'm out this am, but will pick up voice mail.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
 
 PS  I can't wait to hear about St. Lucia.

 In an effort to pull the pieces together, a meeting has been scheduled to 
 discuss the draft energy and capacity contract (formerly the PPA).  It is 
 scheduled for Thursday, August 24th, at 900am.  We are still in the process 
 of locating a conference room, so the location is TBD.
 
 Thanks,

 Some of you may have received this already.  I have not compared it against
