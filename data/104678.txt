 
 There are TWO (2) Enron affiliates having master agreements with Morgan 
 Stanley Capital Group Inc. ("MSCG"):
 
 (1)  ECTRIC has an ISDA Master Agreement with MSCG dated 3/25/99 but 
 effective as of 8/29/97
 
 (2)  ECT (now ENA) has a Master Energy Price Swap Agreement with MSCG dated, 
 and effective, as of 6/16/92
 
 With respect to the TD (TEXAS) master agreement having a "RESTRICTED" status, 
 I will need to speak with Rod Nelson.

 Sara,
 I have spoken to Kim Theriot and she has said that that you are the person 
 who needs to sign off on the Master ISDA agreement which TD wish to use. 
 Could you let me me know if this is ok,  I need to get back to TD today. Kim 
 has confirmed that the ISDA has been fully executed.
 Also could tell me which ISDA,  ENA have in place with Morgan Stanley Capital 
 Group Inc. Kim says its was executed on 2nd March '99 but I don't know if it 
 is the same ISDA as  the one TD want to use.
 
 
 Regards
 
 Treasa
