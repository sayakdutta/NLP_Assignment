 
 I'm out of pocket the rest of the week. I think the best description is the 
 general Enron Corp description.  It is very generic, and is found at the 
 bottom of all Enron press releases. If I get access, I'll forward it to you - 
 unfortunately I can't access it now.  It is one of those "Enron is a leading 
 blah blah blah" things.  Lots of help I am!
