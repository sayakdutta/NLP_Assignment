 
 We have a buyback under HPL (#586534).  ENA had only 7,000/day scheduled at 
 mtr 1373 in Feb.  In reviewing the daily volumes in POPS, I didn't see any 
 days with flow under 18,000.  So, we should not need a buyback for ENA.  Any 
 shortages should be allocated to the HPL ticket.

 Daren - Thu has asked if I can extend deal 343421 thru Feb. '01.  I told her 
 I didn't have the authority to do this.  It is for Equistar.  It looks like 
 it is a term deal expiring Jan. '01.   She wants it added to keep the ENA 
 deal whole.  What do you suggest?

 Aimee,
 
 This is the deal for Equistar.  There is not enough gas at meter 1373 to keep 
 the ENA deal whole.  I need this deal to create buyback.  This was out there 
 last month and Anita told me to get the deal extended.  Let me know if there 
 is another way.

 Why do you need it extended?  This deal may not be able to get extended.  
 Which meter are you having problems with?
 
 
 
    
 Aimee,
 
 I am so sorry...I don't know what's wrong with me.  The deal is 343421.  If 
 you can't extend this deal please let me know.  Thanks

 I don't have access to this ticket.  It is an IM Canada ticket.
