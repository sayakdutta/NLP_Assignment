 Very Critical.

 Okay, I've got authorization for 1 user application.  Please list it in the name of Kevin Hyatt and it should be billed against 0366/112458.  Thanks very much, Paula.

 The cost (pending) is $500.00 per user per application and could be higher pending the response from all the users.

 Paula, I was not listed on your memo re RDI and I have had access since June.  Kevin Hyatt and I work together using this software and in deciding whether to get 1 or 2 accesses, we need to know the price.  Could you let me know that so I can approach our VP about this.
  
 Hope all is going great for you.
  
 Susan
