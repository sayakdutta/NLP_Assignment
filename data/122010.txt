 
 Dear Ms. Monica Vespoli,
 
 It is with great regret that we will have to cancel our Italian holiday and will not be able to stay in your hotel on 30 September - 04 October for 4 nights.  Please cancel the reservations of:
 
 John and Kim Watson
 Dennis and Janell Dye
 Paul and Judith Donnelly
 Tom and Dorothy McCoppin
 

 
 It is our sincere hope that we will be able to reschedule our holiday to Positano in the near future.  Thank you for your kindness.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Kim Watson
