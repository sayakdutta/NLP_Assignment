 afternoon.  We'd both like to participate, but could we start having these 
 meetings later in the afternnon....Thanks.  Jeff
 
 


   
 This is to confirm that there will be an Art Committee meeting on Tuesday, 
 November 7, at 1:30 p.m. in conference room 461 of the Enron Building.  We 
 realize that some of the committee members will not be able to attend.
