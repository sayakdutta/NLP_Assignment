 John,
 
 Hunter Shively needs Doyle Baughman to monitor the construction of a pipeline 
 in the U.S.  Doyle has done this for us in the past.
 
 The terms of the agreement are as follows:
 
 1st month $10,000 + expenses
 2nd+ months $  9,000 + expenses
 
 Hunter anticipates that we will use Doyle for several months.  We can 
 terminate our agreement at anytime.
 
 Regards,
 Brad
