 
 I'm actually trying to go through all my email from the week.  What a pain in 
 the ass.  As soon as I finish one, another appears in my inbox.  So how's 
 life at ucla?
 
 
 
 

    
 
 I think Yelena put a hit out on me all the way from Chicago
 for sending those pictures!  I had no idea they would open
 right away--they were supposed to be attachments.  Oops.  I
 thought they were quite cute.
 
 How are ya?  And what are you doing at work--I thought you
 gas guys all left at 3!
