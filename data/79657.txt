 Just received return phone call from Ito van Lanshot at Reliant.  I 
 referenced earlier telecon between Bob Harvey and Mike McConell regarding 
 possibilities on coal side.  Ito mentioned that he has an on-going dialog 
 with John Sherriff regarding joint opportunities.  I explained nature of 
 delivered coal deals we are doing in UK/Germany/Spain and expressed interest 
 in similar arrangement in ARA ports - mentioned I had on-going dialog with 
 Peter Davies.  He responded that they are evaluating continuing relationship 
 with GKE on and on-going basis.  He would be interested in hearing more about 
 nature of deals we are doing - he will get update from Peter Davies on status 
 of GKE relationship and then would like to schedule a meeting in either 
 London or Amsterdam to discuss possibilities.  Said he would touch base with 
 John Sherriff (or directly with me) during the next 2 weeks.
 
 Will keep everyone posted.
