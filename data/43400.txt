 
 The normal process is to have him interviewed by three members of the 
 Executive Committee who then confirm that he meets our requirements for being 
 an Enron VP.  I assume you are asking us to agree to deviate from this 
 process.  I am uncomfortable with that due to the fact that if the process is 
 not going to be adhered to anyone can nominate a person for VP based on the 
 strength of an individuals resume.  If everyone else agrees to the exception 
 I won't be the one to hold this up but I don't necessarily agree with the 
 exception being granted.
 
 














































  
  
 I would like to pursue an offer to Mr. Shea prior to the next Executive 
 Committee meeting on May 7, 2001.  Please forward your comments or questions 
 by Tuesday, May 1, 2001 so that I can extend the offer by Wednesday, May 2, 
 2001.
 
 You will find attached the recommendation letter and his resume.
 
 Regards,
