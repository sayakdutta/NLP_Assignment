 
 i have kept in touch with Gildea and Brechbuhl.  i didn't really know Eckberg 
 very well.  Powell is now an FCC commissioner, though i haven't kept in touch 
 with him either.  i don't know if you remember james conforti, but i recently 
 saw gildea and brechbuhl at his wedding in february.  give me a call when you 
 get a chance.  my extension is 35220.
