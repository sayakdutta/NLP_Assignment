 
 Hi Matt,
 
 ENA is selling some of the LM6000's to ESA.  Will you be the ENA Tax Man on 
 the deal?  
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay

 Kay,
  Attached is the LM 6000 and options scope that ESA has prepared, that will 
 be input to our MOU.  It does not reflect the scope of equipment that will be 
 procured from ABB yet; this should be forthcoming.  Also below is the current 
 cost estimate of the machines with their S&S options and the ABB scope.  
 Please let us know what other information regarding scope that you might 
 need.  
 
 Thanks,
 Kevin

 Chris, attached is the total scope to S&S.  From this list you should be able 
 to make your change order to S&S base on purchased quantities versus required 
 quantities.  I have provided you the required quantities.  
 I provided you a column for the delta cost to S&S.  When you are finished, 
 please complete the spreadsheet for all of our records.  I do not know how we 
 are to add cost for storage either.
 Thanks,
 John
 
 
 
    
  
 Here are the total cost for the S&S scope of supply for the Electrobolt 
 Project.  I have not included any ENA burdens or storage cost.  These cost 
 are from purchase order with ENA to S&S.
                                                                               
                                                                               
      EIGHT MACHINES               EACH
 The total cost of the LM 6000's, sprint package, water injection 
 skid                = $112,855,600  or $14,106,950 each
 The total cost of options (chillers stacks, cooling tower, mod. buildings, 
 etc. =     13,309,400  or      1,663,675 each
                                                                               
                                                Totals                = $ 
 126,165,000 or   $15,770,625 each
 
 The transformers from ABB in Brazil should cost $3,200,000. total in Brazil 
 without shipping to the site.     
 
 Hope this helps you with the WLB bucket.
 John
