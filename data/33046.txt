 
 Hey, it works for me.  
 
  
     
 
 What an intelligent requirement. 
  
     
 Actually I don't need any more as long as my prospective mate has 1 or 2 
 less than me :o) 
 
      

 
             
    Like I'm at 99...  What are you shooting for, exactly? 
       
                         
      Shooting for triple digits?

         Bumping up mine. 
            
                                             
           And what exactly will you be doing while I'm bumping up that 
      magic 
           number??

              Just so you can start planning your night of debauchery now, I 
      will 
           be 
              going on a one-night trip to NYC Jun 4, returning Jun 5.
