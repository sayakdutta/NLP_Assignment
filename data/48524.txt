 The analog lines are tagged right on the user end of the cord with yellow stickies with their extension numbers written on them as you'd asked. 
 
 I'll have you the fax numbers in a couple minutes. 
 
 I'm out of the office for a couple of hours.

 I can't tell the fax numbers on some of the faxes and where the analog lines are.  Can you meet with me?
