 etc.  I'll bring the info shortly and we can e-mail to Randy's assistant in 
 Sao Paulo.  Thanks.  SS

 I'm sorry Sara,  I forgot that your participation is new on this meeting. We 
 are using the same format as we used on the formerly Chief Counsel Meetings.
 
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions.
 Best regards,
 Elizabeth.
