 That is funny.  I just ordered some more to sell on EBay, I can buy four sleeves for $16.50 and they are going for $40 a sleeve on EBay.  You might want to sell them.  We were actually a skit last week on Saturday Night Live.  Pretty funny stuff.  Keep working on your wife about Jazz Fest.  Ash is working her too.

 You guys are going to end up as a skit on Saturday Night Live. Also I forgot
 to send you so love
 for the Care Package. No golf course will let me on with them but that's ok.
 I will put them
 in my bag with my Firestone Golf balls.
 Thanks again for the stuff.
