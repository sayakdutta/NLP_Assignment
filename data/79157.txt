        Negotiations with SoCal have gone nowhere.  Out of the $6.0m (past and future) in dispute, they have only offered about $600,000 in value.  We're taking one more shot at negotiating a deal whereby they would take more capacity going west and/or having them buy out of West Texas lateral space which TK and Lorraine would sell for incremental revenue.  If this doesn't prove fruitful, then I would intend to pursue the FERC decision.  Agreed?
