 
 Let's go ahead and do a call.  Good time for the 3 of us to catch up on what we've been up to (unless Alan and Sue are strongly opposed).  But no need to set up a formal agenda.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Did you folks want to try to have a Staff meeting/call this week?
 or would you rather let it go until Paul returns?
 
 Pls advise,
 Thanks,
 Joseph
