 now, as is,"  but if more is needed to fix the credit issue, want to be 
 prepared to tell them how the decision needs to be modified.  If it's fine as 
 is, all the better.
 
 Best,

 We like the Alternate Order.  It is a big step in the right direction.  Jean 
 Bennett is preparing a draft letter in support which we were going to file by 
 no later than Friday.  Pat Boylston and I will go over the letter and discuss 
 it with Jean.  I'm not really sure we are going to want to do any surgery on 
 the wording or not.  I invite Jean and Pat to give you a quick comment on 
 this.  ----cgy 
 
 

    
 Christian:
 
 Could you let me know as soon as possible if 1) the proposed decision that I 
 faxed you yesterday is go to go, i.e., adequately addresses our concerns 
 regarding creditworthiness or if 2) we want to recommend some additional 
 provisions?  If we want to recommend additional provisions, could you let me 
 know what those are?  I want to make a run at getting this deal done at the 
 CPUC ASAP,and would like to push Peevey to get Davis to have the PUC pass it 
 out at their next meeting. But need to know if it's good as is or needs some 
 tweeking.  Thanks very much.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
