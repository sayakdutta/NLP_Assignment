 
 Greetings Jeff:
 
 Hope all is well.  I hear that my cameo in the video upstaged the pie....
 
 If there's anything I can do to assist on the request from Chambers, just let 
 me know.
 
 All the best,
 Jeff

 Mr. Skilling,
 
 I am the Director of Government Affairs at Cisco and work for John Chambers 
 on broadband issues. John is currently one of 8 CEOs on a broadband task 
 force at TechNet that will drive our broadband policy agenda in the US. 
 TechNet (http://www.technet.org) is a 250+ tech CEO-driven policy/political

 We are interested in meeting with the someone in your Broadband Services 
 Group to discuss some of our ideas regarding a business and policy 
 strategy, and hoping you could direct us to the appropriate person(s).
 
 Many thanks and regards from John.
