 
 John,
 
 Thank you for pulling me aside and reinforcing your confidence in me and also putting things into perspective.  I guess the reason I was a little upset is that I feel that we are a family here.  I spend more time with you guys than I do with my wife.  I felt a little betrayed.  I should not have felt that way.  You guys have given me the oppurtunity of a lifetime, I am very thankful for that.  I have never questioned the importance of you or Mike of anyone on our desk.  
 
 Please forgive me if I have been a little down.  I think that I am truly okay now.  It has been a very emotional couple of weeks with everything going on.  I know we will get through this.  I once again want to tell you that I am here for anything that needs to be done.  
 
 You will not here about this situation again.  Thank you for understanding.  I put my total trust in you.  
 
 John
