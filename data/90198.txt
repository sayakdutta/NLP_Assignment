 Kevin , 
 
 I wanted to try to set up an appointment with you regarding any opportunities on the power desk. 
 
 I have worked for Greg Woulfe and Jim Fallon managing the advertising trading in EBS and formerly on the Coal desk for Dan Reck and George McClellan.
 
 How does your schedule look today or Tuesday ? 
 
 Thanks for your time,
