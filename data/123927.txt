 This is just a reminder that 
 timecards need to be submitted no 
 later than 3pm today (Friday, 2-1).  
 Please remember to document your holiday for January 21st 
 (Martin Luther King Day) as a Company Observed Holiday.  
 **Also don't forget to document any 
 vacation or discretionary holiday that you have taken. **
 
 Thanks,
