 Dear Vince
  
 I have not heard from you for a few days and was  wondering what is happening. The last time I spoke to Shelley, everything was  fine and that you were still going ahead with your presentation and  co-presenting the workshop on energy risk.
  
 Please do reply to put my mind at  rest!
  
 Thank you
  
 Andreas
