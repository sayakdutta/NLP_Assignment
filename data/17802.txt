 Below is the agenda for today's IEP member company lobbyist conference call
 at 2pm.  I expect this to be a short one, since it is intended to make sure
 everyone is on the same page with the week's ongoings, and share information
 on events scheduled and not scheduled for next week.
 
 Please call (800) 403-2013 and use code: 207814.
