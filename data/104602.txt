 
 Susan:  Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  We have agreed to delete 
 the CSA and will return a blackline to you shortly.  You may recall that SITA 
 expressly requested that the Enron agreement be governed by English law which 
 is why we prepared this document for execution by our affiliate in London 
 with the jurisdiction language appearing in the prior draft.  There are still 
 issues posed by your markup and we should be able to schedule a conference 
 call next week.  Thanks.  Sara

 Further to my fax of 3 October we have SITA's instructions.
 
 1 - Credit Support Annex :
 
 SITA's position is unchanged. SITA does not wish to have a Credit Support 
 Annex.  SITA have asked that ENRON come up with a proposal on the term and 
 volume of the transactions on the basis of no Credit Support Annex.
 
 2 - SITA does not provide investment services ancillary to its main 
 activities. Do you have any news regarding ENRON on this point?
 
 Kind regards
 Susan Hopkinson
