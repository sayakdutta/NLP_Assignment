 The below information gives a brief update of the current situation between Local 15 and Midwest.  We expect to have additional information tomorrow from our sources.  
 
 Sources report the following:
 Local 15 is currently in the planning stages of a strike and are hoping that while this process is going on, negotiations will start with Midwest.  
 The real issue with Local 15 is when Midwest purchased ComEd, they assumed all ComEd agreements with the labor union.  However, the labor union feels Midwest has not complied with this agreement and at this point Local 15 is using the threat of a strike to get Midwest's attention.  
 IBEW sanctioned a strike last Friday and took this action as a sign of support for the Local 15.  The IBEW support gives the Local 15 bargaining power in their discussions with Midwest.  The hope is that the possibility of a strike will put enough pressure on Midwest to get them to the negotiation table.  Chicago's Local 15 union is a compilation of 7 local unions.
 Since Midwest took ownership of the plants, there has been 45 cases brought before the grievance committee and all 45 cases have been referred to arbitration. These cases were filed due to the labor unions perception of Midwest not following the original labor contract.  Currently, the labor union lacks the funds for this costly procedure.  Prior to Midwest, ComEd and the labor unions were able to work out grievances.
 The IBEW has filed a complaint with the National Labor Relations Board claiming Midwest is unwilling to negotiate.  The hearing is scheduled for July 10th.
