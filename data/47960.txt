 Tana,
 
 I just noticed that the contract is not signed by Dynegy. I have to send back 
 both originals. Do you want me to FedEx it to them or do you want to do it?

 Please return our original copy of the agreement to me along with the copy of 
 the cover letter evidencing that you sent the copy to Dynegy.  Thanks.
 
 
 
 

 
 Tana,
 
 I have picked up the Dynegy Direct contract from Sally Beck.  Jean Mrha has 
 signed it, and I will be faxing a copy and mailing one of the originals of 
 the agreement back to Dynegy tomorrow. Please let me know if you need 
 anything else on this agreement.
 
 Thanks,
 Judy Thorne
