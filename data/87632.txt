 Debra,
 
 As requested  here is a bit of history regarding the initial request for the
 above referenced Agreement.
 
 On July 1, 1999 through October 31, 1999 Cabot began purchasing supply from
 Enron at Sumas.  When we received the Transaction Agreement dated June 10,
 1999, I began calling regarding the Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement
 dated November 1, 1993, stated therein.   I could find no such agreement in
 our files.
 
 On July 28, 1999, Karen Lambert faxed this Agreement. I then realized that
 Enron was utilizing an Agreement which had not been assigned to Cabot in its
 merger with Washington Energy Resources Company in May 1994.  I tried on
 several occasions to explain the situation.  Finally on October 24, 2000 we
 received the above referenced Agreement originally effective October 1,
 2000.  We then requested the effective date to be July 1, 1999 to encompass
 the original transaction along with the three (3) additional transactions.
 
 See the attached sheet for specific deal information.

 Hope this helps.  I have submitted the master agreement for execution and
 will let you know when it is on its way.  Thanks.
 
 Laurie
