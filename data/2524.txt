 
 i probably would have told you within the first 2 months
 
 
     
 
 rock and roll.  when were you planning on telling me-after he had been on the desk for three months.  you are never going to make the good vp list.
  
  
 
 
     
 
 asap.  how about we just make him sign it and then the two of us split the 10k??

 I'm still at work and very hungry-that is what is up with me.  what is up with you?
  
 We have been doing 10k (i think) for them to sign the retention agreement.  We sh/d be consistent.  I will verify number w/Karen Buckley and have legal produce the doc.  When are you thinking of having him move over?
 
 
     
 
 what is up with you?
  
 just kidding.  we're bringing him onto the desk in an analytical role assuming his reviews are a-okay.  can you get me a 3 month evergreen doc with his name on it for if we do hire him.  the question was whether to bring him into the trading track.  we're gonna bring him on and if he does well, just merge him into it.
