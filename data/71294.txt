 
 Please create a duplicate set of documents in my CA Development folder, just 
 changing the name to CA Energy Development II LLC.  I'll need both sets.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay

 Here's a set of CA I revised docs.  If these are ok, we will get CA II lined 
 up as well.
 
 
 
 I'm on the road tomorrow, but should be back in the office on Wednesday am.
