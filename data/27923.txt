 pipeline that wanted to interconnect with us.  DF

 I assume this does nothing for our intrastate situation???
 
 we probably ought to circle back together sometime next week to see where we 
 are.  Eric, Tony and I will be in a data room tomorrow.  I wander off to see 
 the Navajos on Monday and will not be back until late morning Tuesday.
 
 Since I'm going to spend a fun filled Wednesday and Thursday with our PG&E 
 friends - What does Tuesday afternoon look like????
 
 Jan - can you follow up with everyone??  thx
 
 
  
 Please read the attached memo regarding the significant shift in the 
 Commission's policy.   The policy sets out new interconnection criteria, but 
 announces that a pipeline may not deny an interconnection on economic grounds.
