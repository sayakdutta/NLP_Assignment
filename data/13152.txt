 Michelle, John, Attached please find the draft check-list I prepared per your 
 requests.  I utilized a variety of legal memorandums and topic reference in 
 developing this.  In the many instances listed,  the consensus from both 
 NEPCO and ECC should be paramount.  Please let me know if  there are topics 
 you would clarify.  I believe we were going to attempt a joint discussion 
 after receipt and review of this draft.   I have good availability for a 
 conference discussion on:
 Thursday 6/1/2000 - through 6 PM PST
 Monday 6/5/2000 - 12 through 6 PM PST 
 Thursday 6/8/2000  - 12 through 5 PM PST
 I will be trying to vacation in the interim periods.  Thanks,  I'll look 
 forward to your comments.  Rj.
