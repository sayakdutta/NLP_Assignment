 We will adopt your suggestion and fast on Wednesday mornings form 8 to 12,
 so that we all are on one accord, that way we're all praying at the same
 time and fasting at the same time. Be blessed Dana:-)

 You are right.  I did misunderstand.  Sounds great to me and just for my
 information, what day and time is your group fasting?
 
 
 
 

 
    
 
 I'm sorry if you misunderstood me, but what I was trying to convey was that
 Rev. Jacque ask that we communicate with our assigned organized group
 by-way of calling three way every Tuesday night if possible and to lift up
 the concerns that was given to us in the hand-outs and also anything else
 that God lays on our heart.
 
 The time that you have set aside for fasting sounds great. Rev. Jacque
 mentioned in the last meeting that we would discuss a time for all so that
 we could be on one accord. I think what Rev Jacque wants most for all of us
 is to start communicating and being on one accord even when we're not
 assembled together on Monday night.
 
  I would think that if we're praying on Tuesday's and fasting on
 Wednesday's, there will be some definite strongholds torn down. What do you
 think?

 I have already asked my team members to block out every Wednesday morning
 from 8am to 12pm for our fast time and it was feasible for all (Bonnie,
 myself, Cheryl S. & Betty).  If we need to change our time to comply with
 all the members of the prayer ministry, let me know and I will get the word
 out.
 
 God Bless All

 Matthew 18:20 states "For where two or three are gathered together in My
 name, I am there in the midst of them".
 
 Greeting My Dear Sisters In Christ,
 
 It has been suggested by our Prayer Ministry Leader that we establish a
 common time for our Organized Units to pray. It seems as though Tuesday
 night at 9:30 pm would be the  most convenient, at this present time.
 
 It is my discernment that tonight should be our starting date. Please make
 every attempt to comply with this endeavor in order that we may attack the
 strongholds and be unified in  the body of Christ.
 
 If this is not conducive for your schedule please suggest an alternative.
 
 Be Blessed
 Edith:-)
