 Alan,
 
 I just received this from our client rep detailing their position.
 As expected they are treating the Stage 1 as ending at 11:32 rather than HE 23 as stated on May 31 in both their website and on their message net.  
 I would like to get FERC's position on this if necessary.  If it is $91.87 rather than $108.49 as indicated in the FERC order, we will use that as a cap as soon as FERC (or you) recommends it.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Bill
 
 
  
     
 Bill, the $108.08 price you see in Footnote #3 of the e-mail titled CAISO
 Notice: Correction of FERC June 19 Order Market Notice is the highest hourly
 ex-post price during the last Stage 1.  The $91.87 price is 85% of $108.08
 per the FERC Order.
 
 The last Stage 1 occurred on Trade Date 5/31/01, HE 10 and 11.  A Stage 2
 was in effect from 1132 - 2215.  See
 http://www.caiso.com/docs/09003a6080/08/8a/09003a6080088aa7.xls , 2001
 Emergency Detail tab.
 
 The Hourly Ex Post Price can be found in OASIS under Button 29, Ex Post
 Market Information on the CAISO Website. The Order indicates that the price
 should not include a Stage 2 and 3 and even though the cancellation notice
 of the Stage 1was not until HE23 we are going by the strict definition of
 when the Stage 1 was actually implemented.  Hope this helps.
