 Jeremy,
 
 We will need no additional curves.  Only those designated by the gas group will need to be moved.  Thanks for the heads-up.

 Stacey:
 
 The Gas Risk group is requesting that we preserve only a specified list of curves/pub codes for 
 NetCo/UBS, and to delete the rest of the curves from TAGG/ERMS.
 
 Please provide a list of Natural Gas curves/pub. codes that you would like to preserve in NetCo/UBS.
 
 I am attaching the list of Natural Gas curves to preserve that Kam provided, for your reference:
 
  << File: Netco Curves.xls >> 
 
 Thanks,
 Jeremy
