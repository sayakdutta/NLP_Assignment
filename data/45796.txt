 
 I just spoke to Frank, and spoke to Jeff Blumenthal earlier this week about 
 tax issues arising out of Amita executing documents on behalf of EOL and 
 ENA.  Frank just informed me that the Japan office has also been provided 
 with stamp of Sheri Thomas's signature so they can execute PA's out of 
 Japan.  Frank and I were thinking we might want to get together sometime next 
 week to discuss this.
