 Thanks a lot for the answer to my question.
 
 I shall work with the numbers at home tonight. 
 
 Congratulations to you and your colleagues on
 a great paper and exciting work in the risk
 management area.

 Dear Mr. Kaminski,
 
 Thank you for your email concerning my paper on EVT and VaR.
 I have thought about your question:
 
 If you take formula (2.8) and plug in the parameters (u=10, N_u=56, beta=11.120
 chi=0.186, q=0.95, n=108) you get hat(x)=42.86 DM.
 Now we only have to explain the minus:
 If you look at figure 3, you see that we considered the absolute negative
 returns, i.e. we neglected the minus sign of these returns. but in the DRC we
 have to pay attention on the minus sign, since we consider returns, not only
 absolute returns. this is the reason for the minus in equation (3.10).
 
 I hope I could help you with this explanation.
 
 If you have further questions don't hesitate to ask me.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Susanne Emmer
