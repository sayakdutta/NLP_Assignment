 After discussion with Patrice, here is the finalized agreement for the 
 day-ahead purchase deal (between ENA-central desk and EMW) for the Wilton 
 Plant. 
 
 Location:  Northern Border (Wilton) to become MEH pooling point
 Price:        GD chicago large end-users plus $.015 or GD northern border 
 chicago point if one becomes available
 Term:        6/1/2000 thru 9/30/2004
 Volume:  0-75,000 mmbtu/daty
 Notification: by 9:15 am of trade date
 
 Any volumes greater than 75,000 up to 120,000 will be priced at Patrice's 
 purchase price plus $.015 
 
 I will draft a simple letter for both parties to sign, as a matter of record 
 keeping.  Call me if you have any questions.  Thanks
