 Grant,
 
 Can Research in Houston put together a comparison of the long-term volatility 
 curves for gas and power in North America and Europe?  Based on where Europe 
 is marked (especially for the UK), I think we'll find a significant 
 difference out beyond 10 years.  Fundamentally, it seems like the long-term 
 vol should be similar for a given commodity regardless of geographic location.
 
 Has Research done any work on this in the past?  If not, we should study this 
 since long-term vol feeds into the VAR-based position limits.
 
 Give me a call so we can discuss.
 
 Thanks
 
 Dale
