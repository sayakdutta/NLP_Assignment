 
 I am not responsible for THIS Tribasa mess.  My responsibility ended when 
 Tribasa IV was signed.
 
 Buenas suerte,

 In retrospect, I apologize for not contacting Ms. Mann earlier (my former 
 colleague who is responsible for this Tribasa mess) for she indeed did 
 confront the issue that we are confronting.  Based on the attachment below 
 and the other emails I am forwarding you, it appears that our procedure for 
 accelerating EECC's payment rights will be to issue a letter to Republic Bank 
 who will then issue a default letter to Tribasa and then based on that we can 
 then issue a demand to AI.  If Ms. Mann so desires, she is welcome to 
 participate in our 2:45 conference call, by rsvping through email.

 Kay,
 
 Attached please find the letter to Republic National Bank.  I just got the 
 original you sent me yesterday.
 
 Best regards,
