 Sara and Carol,
 
 Attached for your review, please find a draft of a letter to be distributed 
 by ENA to Counterparties who are either (i) in Default or (ii) over the 
 Collateral Threshold and for which ENA does not desire to call such default 
 or demand such collateral.  Should you have any comments, please let me know.
 
 Jason
