 Hi Shelley:
 I am getting out invitations for the shower today.  I am sending one to you 
 and Alina so you can see it.  Here is the guest list so far:
 Giok Boothe
 Lisa Corder
 Linda Corredor (co-hosting)
 Jacque Daughtry
 Sydney Free Duvall
 Peggy Erwin
 Nancy Ginsburg
 Dawn Goddin
 Ange Grout
 Wendy Houghton
 Barbara Howard
 Stephanie Keesling
 Carla McGinley
 Kathy Mynarcik
 Becky O'Reilly
 Dorothy Pledger
 Letha Russell
 Pam Thyssen
 Ann Turney
 Patty Wehn-Glowski
 
 I do need to clarify the following:
 1)    Did you say yes to inviting Tami Head?  (My notes aren't clear.)
 2)    You listed Cherie Otto on your list.  I know that she and Barbara 
 Bakanic are very close friends.  Barbara is also in our S/S class when she is 
 not teaching.  Do you think we should invite both of them?
 3)    You were going to get me Gabby's (sp?) address.
 4)    I thought of Maggie Van Syckle.  Are you close with her?
 
 If there's any one else you think of, just let me know.
 Thanks,
 Barbara
