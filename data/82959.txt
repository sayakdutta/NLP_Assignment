 probably want a resume from you.
 Also,  she will want to know what area(s) (eg. accounting, marketing, 
 research, etc.)  you have interest in working. 
 
 Please keep me up to date once she contacts you.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Scott

 Scott-
  Hey there, this is Chris Graeter.  I wanted to check with you to see about
 getting in touch with the person in charge of internships.  I am sure he or
 she is busy, but in the mean time I was not sure if you or the person who

 know that sometimes it is easier to get in touch with someone by email so I
 wanted to make sure you had this information.  Thank you again for all your
 assistance.  I hope to talk to you soon.
 
 Sincerely,
 Chris Graeter
