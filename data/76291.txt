 I'm back.
 
 I'll give you the short version.  I spoke with John, and he tells me he sent 
 Mark and Vicky a  note saying that you  had paid your debt to society and are 
 free to explore other options.  Pretty good stuff.  
 
 I want to hear what M. Cash said, and who else you are meeting with.  Maybe I 
 can lay some ground work.
