 Gerry, I've looked over the agreement and still don't believe that it raises 
 any PUC regulatory issues.  If you need more (or a more formal version of 
 this e-mail) please contact me.

 Dan,  Per our discussion, attached is the Compressor Services Agreement
 between Enron Compression Services Company  and Tennessee Gas Pipeline
 Company.  This is a rough draft at this point, but should give you a good
 idea of the structure of this deal.  Note that Section 3.4 will be removed
 as this is no longer part of the deal.
