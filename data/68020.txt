 The Raiders have always been my team. The Chargers are my Home team.
 I will ask about the Vegas weekend.

 What????  I thought that was your team?  I am a big raiders fan and I hope
 Chucky gets that ring this year.  Hey, FYI, we are getting a guys trip to
 Las Vegas for the first weekend of March Madness if you are interested -
 March 13-16th.  Got a room at the Mirage and it is $120 per person for the
 three nights.  I figure air fare is pretty cheap from SD, let me know if
 you are interested.  Take care.

    I hope they move to L.A.  GO RAIDERS
 
    
                 
 
    that is absolutely hilarious.  I have heard a rumor that the Chargers
    are
    considering moving to LA....Is that correct?  That will be absolutely
    horrendous.  I saw the game of the century the other day on ESPN
    classics...Chargers vs. Dolphins 1983.  Truly awesome.  My man at the
    time
    Winslow(racist) got carried off three times.

       I can not open the file...Is this the kid from the man show selling
       beer?
       I have also seen him trying to buy beer.
