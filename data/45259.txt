 Tana,
 
 It looks like there are changes on this against the online ETA which are not 
 redlined. Do you have any other information about these changes? (I'd like to 
 avoid having to do a line-by-line comparison.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Dave
 
 
    
  
 Attached is a copy of the amended ETA that Carol sent you in early July.  
 Please let me know if the changes meet with your approval.
