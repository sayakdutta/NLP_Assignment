 is to 1) get a real market and 2) keep Edison out of bankruptcy.  Whether C=
 alifornia can execute on it is another story.  But we're trying damned hard=
  to make it happen.  IEP should support it.  Anything that you can do with =
 Jan would be useful and appreciated.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 The attached is the final product of the discussions which have been
 occurring between the various consumer groups attempting to keep Edsion
 solvent while retaining some potential for direct access.  IEP has
 participated in some of these discussions.
 IEP is being asked to sign this letter. It is time sensitive because of
 pending PUC action on Direct Access.
 
 Therefore I am calling an emergency Board Call for TODAY THURSDAY 6/28/01
 3:00 pm PST.
 
 Call-in number: 1-877-288-4427
 Participant Code: 934948
