 out this weekend anyways, since the production time was so short- but maybe
 a chance to tonight (wednesday) after the show.  depending on your plans, he
 could make for a very interesting wild card in the situation.....very
 wealthy, attractive, successful, mid-30's LA producer/writer w/ house on
 hermosa beach.....not a guy I'D want to have to compete with- makes a
 twenty-something energy trader from nw coast w/ school teacher finacee sem
 pretty lame!  just a thought.....am knee deep in copyright articles rt now-
 if you happen to come across any news relating to european patent law,
 digital images,fine art and ethics, pass them my way!
