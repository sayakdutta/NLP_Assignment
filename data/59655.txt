 Could you use this file to replace what we currently have for the new DPR?

 To simplify the DPR reporting each Wednesday and Monday, please use the attached spreadsheet to populate and return via email.  This is a temporary solution and I will be working to set up a new export process the streamline reporting.  I would appreciate it if the spreadsheets were emailed priro to noon each Wednesday and Monday.  The main info to include are the positions, p&l and PRMA.
  
 Please remember to include only the information related to active deals that we anticipate fulfilling.  If there are any pieces that should be captured, and for whatever reason you are not able to at this time, please note that as a caveat at the bottom of the spreadsheet.   
  
 Thanks,
