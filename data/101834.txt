 
 Craig,
 
 In an effort to make sure that I am adequately prepared for my interview, I wanted to touch base with you and confirm that I possess all the necessary information and forms.  Last week I received the packet you had mailed containing the application form and company information.  Also, I have confirmed my flights, hotel arrangements and the directions to your facilities with Sharon Roberts.  I assume all the information needed prior to my arrival is already in my possession, if you know of any additional information I may need please let me know.  The last area of interest I am hoping to address is the actual interview schedule.  If it is possible at this point in time, I would appreciate the chance to preview the individuals with whom I will be meeting.  If the interviews have not been completely arranged as of yet then simply disregard the last request.  I look forward to meeting and speaking with you tomorrow.
 
 Thank you,
 Susan Scott
