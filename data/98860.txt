 Richard and Gary - please let me know if you would like us to forward any 
 pleadings.  I agree that the people at Enron should handle any press 
 inquiries.
 

  I just got a call from Chris O'Brien at the San Jose Mercury News

 pleadings in the case against PX and to talk about it.  What do you want me
 to do?  I told him that Enron had people responsible for press enquiry's and
 I would pass his name and request along but I was not authorized to comment.
 
 Thanks
 Gary
