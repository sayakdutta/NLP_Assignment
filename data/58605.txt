 The following illustrious FERC group will be with us on 31 the morning of 
 Dec. 7.  They have asked to have a demonstration in detail of EPMI's systems 
 that track OASIS and market information.  Many of them have not seen EOL, so 
 we need to show them that as well.
 
 The fact that this group is made up of so many FERC office directors means 
 that this visit comes at the request of the Chairman Hoecker.  They will be 
 visiting Dynegy and El Paso later that day.
 
 They are definitely interested in a good presentation from Enron, as we have 
 given them in the past -- primarily because they met so many senior Enron 
 executives.  It would be great if Dave Delainey or John Lavorato could also 
 come by to meet them.
 
 Thanks.
