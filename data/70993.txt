 
 I believe the amount should be calculated through the date of funding.  Will 
 closing and funding take place tomorrow, or will funding be a day later?

 For ESA to exercise its LM 6000 purchase option, it must pay the Option 
 Exercise Price of $101,249,431 (per section 3A of the Option Agreement) plus 
 an additional charge of $21,500 per day for each day after November 22d (per 
 section 3B of the Option Agreement).  If the option is exercised on December 
 20th, the total amount to be paid would be:
 
 Option Exercise Price      $101,249,431
 Plus: Additional Costs: $21,500 per day x 28 days =     $        602,000
 Option Exercise Price plus Additional Costs  $101,851,431
