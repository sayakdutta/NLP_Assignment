 Let me know if you need any info.
 I'll need the laptop plus 2 docking stations, one upstairs and one down.
 And a normal monitor & keyboard.

 Susan,
 
 I've spoke to our purchasing person, Karon O'gorman, about an order status in 
 Omaha.  According to Karon, all purchasing from Omaha and Houston goes 
 through her.  Therefore, if you need to order a new laptop, Karon can handle 
 all of the arrangements for you.
 
 Thanks,
 Jeff Nguyen
