 
 There are multiple Goldman files.  I do have the"ENA/GS&Co." online agreement 
 only.  I have it only for reference as it has been executed.   The problem 
 I'm referring to is the identification of the Lotus Notes Goldman files.  We 
 can catch up in our meeting which I have scheduled for Monday.

 I believe that Goldman is the file that you took back from me la while ago to 
 handle yourself, remember?

 Cheryl:
 
 Goldman is one of the brokers "messed up" in Lotus Notes.  I had given you 
 the files some time ago with my comments.  I think it would make sense for us 
 to sort through Goldman for all affiliated companies.  I don't see an 
 agreement in Lotus Notes for ECT Inv. and Goldman Int'l.

 Sara/Cheryl,
  ECT Investments Inc has received a faxed document from Goldman Sachs 
 International  regarding terms of business for executing equity transactions 
 through the London office.  This document is not intended for the purposes of 
 opening up a new executing broker accouunt with Goldman Sachs International.  
 ECT Investments Inc currently has an existing executing broker agreement with 
 Goldman Sachs & Co which should cover trades done in Houston and London since 
 we are trading under the same legal entity.  The Terms of Business Letter 
 sets forths terms and conditions that would apply to transactions executed by 
 ECT Investments in London which is governed under the SFA rules and 
 regulations.
  I will forward a copy of the document to Cheryl.  Goldman Sachs 
 International is waiting for us to review and sign.  If you have additional 
 questions and concerns, I can be reached at extension 31439.
 
 
 Thanks,
 Theresa
