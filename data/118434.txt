 I just received notice that the Senate Bankruptcy Bill (S. 625) will be on 
 the Senate floor around 3:00 pm today.  
 As of a meeting I had yesterday afternoon, all of our issues look like 
 they're in good shape.
 
 Just to re-cap for everyone: 
 
 1)  DOI proposal on oil & gas leasing -- will not be in managers' amendment 
 and should not be offered on the floor.
 2)  Enron's techincal correction on production payments -- is safely in the 
 bill and will pass if the whole bill passes.
 3)  Enron's additions/changes on derivatives language -- should be inserted 
 at Senator Nickles' behest into the managers' amendment before the bill goes 
 to the floor this afternoon...will get confirmation soon.
 
 I'll be in touch shortly with updates.....
