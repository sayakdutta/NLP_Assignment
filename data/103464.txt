 Due to Randy Young's trip last night, we need to reschedule the above meeting 
 that was suppose to take place today at 10:00 a.m. Brazil time. We are now 
 trying to schedule to 4:00 p.m. Brazil/Argentine time-2:00 p.m. Houston time. 
 
 Please let me know if this time works for you.
 
 Sorry for the inconvenience and short notice.
 Regards,
 Elizabeth.
