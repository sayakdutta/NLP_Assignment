 
 Scott is your main man - I guess.  I don't know if he is going to keep doing 
 it or if he's going to hire an analyst.  I think Susan will be doing Texas 
 Eastern.  Mr. Goodell will be going to the CGAS/TCO meeting on Tuesday.  I 
 may be going Tues afternoon.  
 
 When do you leave Houston?
 
 
 
 
 

    
 
 Vickey told me yesterday was her last day. I see Scott Neal is on Tenn Z0.
 
 There are no quotes out there... just for Enron's info.
 
 I'll be in town this weekend.. going to TCO/Gulf meeting Monday and Tuesday.
 Hope to see you.
 
 Hope your back and other aches are okay.
