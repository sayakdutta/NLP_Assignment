 Have you ever summarized the conversation you had with Jim Schweiger last 
 week re: cost to blow-up Entex deal?  I believe Tom is back today, and I 
 would anticipate his request for our analysis.  Please let me know - I am in 
 meetings all day back-to-back.  Please call on my cell phone - 713-471-2995.  
 Thanks.
