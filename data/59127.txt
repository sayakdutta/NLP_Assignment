 Dear Mr. Lay
 
 I am a reporter with The Asian Wall Street Journal and I understand that you
 have written to the Indian Prime Minister to complain about the Indian
 government's lack of co-operation regarding Dabhol. Is it correct that Enron
 is now threatening to sue the Indian government, MSEB and GOS for a total of
 US$ 4 bn to US$ 5 billion ?
 
 I am very interested in pursuing this story given the lack of action by the
 Indian authorities and wonder if you would be kind enough to verify that you
 have indeed sent this letter to the Prime Minister
 
 Thank you for your help, Sara Webb
