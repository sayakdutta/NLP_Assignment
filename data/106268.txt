 should be attached.  Both Annexes should read SAMPLE or DRAFT with our 
 exclusionary language.  Obviously the Annex B will not have anything on it 
 other than reference to credit determination.  Please e-mail today to John 
 Malowney.  Thanks.  SS  and call if you have questions.

 Being that the potential counter party is Fred Meyer (AKA Kroger Co.) I would 
 consider them a general corporate.  JOHN

 Before I send the draft, please let me know the type of customer (general 
 corporate, utility, municipal, etc.).  Thanks.  Sara
