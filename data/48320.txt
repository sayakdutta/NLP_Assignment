 
 Per my conversations with Tom and Frank, unless Credit specifically tells us 
 that a counterparty is a credit derivatives counterparty, the online team 
 should consider that all U.S. based counterparties are not approved to trade 
 credit derivatives.  Credit will, in the same box where they put "declined" , 
 "amended" or "division", put a note that says "credit derivatives" and in 
 those circumstances only you should consider that I will be indicating 
 whether or not the counterparty is approved to trade credit derivatives.  
 Otherwise, I will not be putting an "X" in the box for each and every 
 counterparty to say they can't trade credit derivatives.
 
 I hope this makes sense to you, call me if it doesn't.
