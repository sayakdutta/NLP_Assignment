 taking care of that. Let me know if you need copies of the letters or if 
 you'd like to speak to Diana directly.

 There are four deals on the no report that look like they sould be 
 confirmed.  Can you take a look at them and check to see why they are coded 
 not to be confirmed?

 I guess you have seen the email that shows what your computer looks like when 
 you work in (or apparently near) California?  You open it and the screen 
 starts moving around.
 
 Stay well!
