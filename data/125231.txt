 
 I hear you are good at facilitating a quick "meating"
 
  

  
 
 I'm playing.  I will be in the office at 5:30 for a quick meeting, but I will join you after that. 
  

   Who is playing, and when should we start? Get back at me so I will know 
 when to show up. 
 Thanks, 
 DJ

        I'm going to shave my team name in the back of my mullet. 
     


            Ack!! Trying to catch up here after several days of vacation.  Quite 
 a 
    meandering collection of emails.  You should get your tee shirts and 
 why 
    not go the whole 9 yards and get custom license plates... take pride 
 in 
    your losing streak!!  Unfortunately I don't think I can make the game 
    tonight, but Thursday or Friday for an xbox demo would be cool.
