 
 John,
 
 Our primary delivery point on the EP capacity is the border so it would have to flow as an alternative delivery location and would be subject to cuts.  I would like to talk to you in more detail about this with the assistance of Stephanie Miller who is the tport expert in our group.  Then you can decide how you would like to persue.  Stephanie will be available in the morning before 11:00 am CDT.
 
 Please give me a call when you can -
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kim
 
  
     
 Good morning Kim, 
 You mentioned yesterday that Enron had some EP capacity to sell.  Well,  
 Citizens is wanting to know if Enron could make firm sales to it for gas to  
 its electric generating facility, Valencia, located in Nogales, AZ.  As I  
 recall the gas requirements are in the range of 1 to 2 MMcf per day.   
 I have the following questions which I would like to discuss with you on this  
 subject: 
 1) Is there sufficient available capacity on the pipeline that will allow the  
 gas to flow? 
 2) Could you make deliveries for the month of August and possibly September? 
 3) What would be the delivered price? 
 4) What is the expectation of this gas showing up everyday? 
 Give me a call on my cell phone to discuss> 
 Best regards, 
 John
