 Vince-
 
 Are you guys still working on that "project" to provide content via EOL?
 The reason I'm asking is we have developed a particular technology to
 deliver fundamentals data via web-based applets, and we could probably
 talk to the vendor about a larger license to permit its dissemination
 this way. There would have to be disclaimers, and it might not work
 because of the liability, but I did want to let you know we have a neat
 technology to permit people to visualize data. Let me know if you want
 to talk about it.
