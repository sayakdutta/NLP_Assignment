 Dear Jeff:
 ?
 Hello!? I wanted to make a bill for you for  the table and ceramic pieces, is 
 that ok?
 ?
 ?
 Can you be in Washington on October 28??  There's a great day-long symposium 
 in conjunction with the Art Nouveau show  (which I saw on Friday, and which 
 is, incidentally, much bigger and better than  the one in London was) which 
 I'm going to, and I would love to be able to tour  around the show with you.? 
 Also, Macklowe Gallery is having a cocktail  party that night for our 
 clients, friends, experts, and assorted fabulous  hangers-on.? You'll get an 
 invite in the mail, but I?wanted to give  you advance notice since I know how 
 hectic your schedule is.
 ?
 I hope it was an easy and meaningful fast for you,  and that this year brings 
 you happiness beyond your wildest  imagination.
 Tell me what's up
 love.
 ben?
