 Vince,
 
 Pursuant to our conversation, I called Jim Kenney (281-297-3557), head of Entergy Management Operations (EMO), which is the entity responsible for ETR's 4-state regulated system.  He indicated that they were looking for someone with IS skills to manage their EMS.  The point of contact for this is Charles Sanders (281-297-3575).  Jim indicated it would be a combination of Hardware/Software skills.  Entergy has a very large and complex regulated system, and I would assume that the EMS (responsible for real-time decisionmaking for Generation response to load) would be quite complex and challenging.  He indicated that he would write a note to Charles to expect your call.  If I can be of further assistance, please let me know.
 
 Best Regards,
 Dale
