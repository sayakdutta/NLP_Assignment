 
 My heart skipped a beat when I read "Today is my last day...".  I thought you were leaving Enron.  Thank goodness you are only moving to a different group.  Congratulations and look forward to working with you in your new job!

 	Today is my last day in the Deal Compliance group (six years, if you can believe that!).  As of Monday, I will be in the CommodityLogic group and will ultimately be hounding all of you from a different angle.  Thanks to all for your help over the years.
