 
 I am curious why N70012.Q is a variance in 0001 and N70012.R is not a 
 variance in 0008.  If you look in the two fred files, 0001 has the liq 
 flashed and not in the GL, and in 0008 the liquidation is in flash and the 
 GL.  The counterparties in both are the same.  Jim needs to revise 0001 
 file.  Shout with any questions.  Thanks.
