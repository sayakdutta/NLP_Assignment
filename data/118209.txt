 We've actually reached and passed our target of 300 executed master swap 
 agreements, so Bill Bradford and Mark Taylor would like to invite the 
 Legal/Credit financial trading team to  a celebration!  Please join us on 
 Wednesday, December 9 from 5:30 to 7:30 (or longer!) at Cafe Noche located at 
 2409 Montrose (just north of Westheimer at Fairview).   Please RSVP so I can 
 get a head count.
 
  To give you an idea of where we were and where we are now, the earliest 
 Pending Swap Update I have dated 7/27/94 (shortly after I started with Enron) 
 shows:
 
 ISDA Masters:  10
 Other Masters:  44
 Total Counterparty Masters:  54
 Internal Masters:  3
 
 Our current master total per Lotus Notes are:
 
 ISDA Masters:  164
 Other Masters:  158
 Total Counterparty Masters:  322
 Internal Masters:  57
 Current drafts out to counterparties:  595
 
 Kudos to everyone for a job well done!
