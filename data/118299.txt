 your satisfaction by Thursday, please let me know.

 Mark,
 
 I notice that we have GTC's for EGLI Liquids(without collateral) and ELFI 
 Crude-Products-Petchems (without collateral), but we do not have GTC's for 
 EGLI Liquids (with collateral) or ELFI Crude-Products-Petchems (with 
 collateral).   Is this correct? 
 
 Please let me know your thoughts.
 
 Thanks!
