 As I mentioned DEY representatives will be in Houston March 19/20 and wanted 
 to meet with you and Jim Derrick.  Jim is not available, but they were 
 wondering if they could meet with you.  Given Jim's position on these types 
 of firms, Jim's unavailability, and your schedule do you have any interest in 
 meeting with them?  Peter.
