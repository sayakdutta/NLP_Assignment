 All,
 
 Starting with the April accounting month Corp is cutting a day off of our 
 close process as part of Project Sunrise.  This means that we will have only 
 five days to get all activity booked.  I will be calling a meeting for later 
 this week or early next week to discuss any issues that may arise from this 
 and future implications of Project Sunrise.  Feel free to call if you have 
 any questions.
