 If at all possible, I would really appreciate postponing the tax discussion 
 until your next swap group meeting, which I think is in 2 weeks.  I have 
 other projects that I have to work on tonight and will not get the 
 opportunity to prepare a presentation for the group before the meeting.  I 
 really appreciate your asking me to speak to the group and also (hopefully) 
 your understanding and patience in postponing the tax discussion.  
 
 Best regards,
 Susan
 
  
     
 Susan:  This may look confusing!  It contains all of our "choices" for 
 preparing the documents.  See Part 2 (Tax Reps) and the end of the document 
 which has our "choices" of tax forms.
 
 I thought it might be helpful to be very basic about withholding issues, 
 etc., why we need the tax reps, and what questions we could ask upfront about 
 a party that would help us select an appropriate tax module.  We tend to not 
 "think" and expect a party "fill in the blank" when we are preparing draft 
 documents.
