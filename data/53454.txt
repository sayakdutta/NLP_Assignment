 I am forwarding you a message I have received from the University of Houston.
 Can you help them? We have a very good relationship with the UoH.

 Dear Mr. Kaminski,
 
 I am writing to ask a favor for Dr. Michelle Foss. As you know we will
 be running our "New Era" program from May 14- May 25th. Dr. Foss was
 wondering if on May 22nd (between 1:30pm and 4:00pm) , we would be able to
 bring
 our participants for a tour of your trading floor. At this time we will have
 30-40 people, and since only 10 people maximum should really be on a
 trading floor we need to have 4 companies among which to divide our
 participants. At this time, we have a floor from Coral Energy, and are
 working with Duke,
 and I will be contacting Mr. Paul Roberts to arrange for the Reliant Energy
 trading floor. I was hoping very much that you would be able to direct
 me to the right person to contact to arrange this tour. Will this be a
 possiblity? I really appreciate your help very much. Thank you!
 
 Best Regards,
