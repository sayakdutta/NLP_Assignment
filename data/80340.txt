 
 Eric,
 
 A couple of high priority activities we need to address very quickly.
 Run down of Nigeria deal (100/400 mmbtu/d)
 Bahamas - Skilling update, acceleration of Corp effort, approvals
 Elba - supply and managing t-o-p
 Ven - Lay call, timing of Ven decision and game plan
 R Bergseiker future and other EI people
 Asia strategy and clarification
 Current view of Long/Short via category of segment (shipping, physical, 
 facilities)
 
 I know you are on top of all of these items but Jeff and I want to run them 
 down and get an update.
 
 Thanks,
 m
