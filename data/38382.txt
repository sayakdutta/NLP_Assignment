 
 Hello.  We would like the ability to trade cash with Puget Sound.  It is very difficult to interrupt the business and information that we receive from serving Puget as we near the winter months.  If you need to freeze business to evaluate the impact of the recent ruling, then please freeze baseload business only.
 
 In the future, please call me with any credit issues in the west.  Phillip Allen is no longer the Desk Director of the west.
 
 Sincerely,
 Mike Grigsby
