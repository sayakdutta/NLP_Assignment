 On April 25, you and your counterparties were provided with draft 
 documentation (including the Schedule and Paragraph 13 to the Credit Support 
 Annex).  Did you read the documents?  Are you asking for ISDA boilerplate?  I 
 will be here until noon.

 Sara/ Frank-
 do you think we can get the draft of the CSA before you leave for your 
 offsite.. Frank- want to discuss you coming up to discuss ISDAs.. in the

 You should have already seen the two ISDA's (Valentis, CD Holdings) emailed 
 yesterday evening per your instructions.  I am still waiting for you to send  
 information regarding inhouse/outside legal counsel for both parties.
 
 The Schedule and Paragraph 13 sent to Valentis et al is very much like the 
 hedge fund template which legal is refining.  We are reviewing the first 
 draft and commenting.
 
 FYI - I will not be in the office on Friday, April 27.  Also, the Enron legal 
 conference is next week and the lawyers will be in San Antonio from May 2 
 (afternoon) through May 4.  And finally, I will be on vacation during the 
 week of May 7 - May 11.  Please try to make plans (conference calls, 
 counterparty comments, etc.) accordingly.
 
 Let me know if you have any questions.
 
 Thanks.
