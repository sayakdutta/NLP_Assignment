Obviously not an opportune time to come take the tour right now.  Not so impressive when the building is 80% empty.  If/when we get the operation started again, I'll bring you up for a tour.
 
  
     
 
 John-
 Was lovely meeting  you this weekend. Sorry I was...less then effusive by Sullivan's. It wasn't  the company -- I assure you.
  
 And what about this  white elepha...trading floor? I want to get it while it  lasts.
  
 look forward to  it
