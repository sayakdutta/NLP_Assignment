 We have just completed a one week transfer of trading and e-commerce 
 knowledge and experiences with both Houston and London. This had been done to 
 better prepare for the launch of EOL Argentina. I wanted to communicate the 
 results as a reflection upon any future support or orientation we may deem 
 appropriate for our activities.
 
 The North American exchange was technically strong yet lacked any commercial 
 depth, experiences or strategies applicable to an emerging energy market. The 
 advanced nature of the North American energy market makes it very difficult 
 to share experiences and knowledge with Argentina due to the widely different 
 states of development and application of business strategies.
 
 The European exchange was well received and very much bi directional. This is 
 obviously as a result of being more closely aligned with our current state of 
 evolution and in some cases Argentina is actually ahead of Europe. In that 
 the Argentina energy market was designed closely in relationship to the UK 
 market it is logical we have more in common and can leverage off these 
 similar market experiences. Europe embraced the exchange even to the extent 
 of holding a company meeting for the presentation of the Argentina business 
 experience and corresponding strategy.
 
 I believe we should seek out a stronger tie to Europe in the future and 
 foster growth in our relationship to better support, facilitate and grow our 
 business.
