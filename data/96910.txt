 Hi guys - here is a WSPP request for products.  Can you send them the CAISO language.  Should we send other language.  Can one of you attend (I will be on out on vacation starting July 20th) Thanks.  Hope all is well.
  
     
 The call will involve a discussion of products.  Could you send to me the changes which you have been making to the CalISO product that Enron and others are using?  If there are any other product issues that you want to discuss, please let me know.  I will forward to all on the list what I receive.
