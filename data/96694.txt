 Attached is a form of Master Energy Purchase and Sale Agreement.  I believe 
 that the provisions that you are looking for are contained in Section 3.5.  
 The only concern I have is that the attached may not be the latest and 
 greatest EPMI trading form (although I am reasonably comfortable that the 
 cover damage language will not need a substantial overhaul).  There have been 
 numerous discussions about this form being revised.  By carbon copy of this 
 email, I am requesting that Elizabeth Sager forward to each of us, the latest 
 and greatest form if it has been finally agreed upon.
