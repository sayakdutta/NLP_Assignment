 As you are aware, Enron signed an agreement with Blockbuster Inc. last summer 
 to launch an entertainment on-demand service.  We announced today that we are 
 discontinuing our exclusive relationship with Blockbuster in order to expand 
 the offering by developing direct relationships with content providers and 
 distribution partners.
 
 We have made tremendous progress toward our goal of becoming the leading 
 provider of entertainment on-demand over a digital platform.  We rolled out 
 the trial service in Seattle, Portland, Salt Lake City and New York in 
 December, and today subscribers are buying movies on-demand using the service 
 we created.
 
 However, the exclusive relationship with Blockbuster has not yielded the 
 quantity and quality of movies needed to drive demand for this exciting, new 
 on-demand service.  Now that we have proven the concept, we want to take our 
 service to the next level by adding content and subscribers on an accelerated 
 basis.  We feel that this can be best achieved by pursuing entertainment 
 on-demand independently.
 
 We intend to initiate discussions with various content providers for 
 delivering their content over the Enron platform.  We remain very positive 
 about the potential of this business for EBS and Enron and will keep you 
 apprised of our progress.
