 to Tony Pryor to ask about #3.

 1) Enron Net Work should probably be EnronOnline, LLC
 
 2) 1. What is a Passport Application?
 
 3) 3.  I agreed we wouldn't pass along any details of any bids to ENA 
 employees. I don't know what all of this paragraph entails. Can you shed some 
 light, or should we just ask them to reword it?

 Mark, Taffy said you're under the weather. Hope you're feeling better by the 
 time you open this. The attached draft is revised slightly from the one I 
 previously sent to you for review. The changes are nonsubstantive from your 
 standpoint - -  most of them were made to clarify that there will be 
 offerings from the pipelines other than open seasons. In making the changes, 
 I forgot to do a redlined draft for you, so I am faxing to you a copy 
 redlined by hand. 
 
 Thanks again for all your help.
 
 Tony
