 
 I had a big lunch, so something light sounds good.
 
 
 
 


   
  
 I spoke with a lady in St Louis HR who said she paid in advance for her
 child last year. She said it does not matter when you paid. She suggested we
 ask St F for a quarterly statement. That's what she used last year and had
 no problem whatsoever getting reimbursed. I bet we are not the only folks in
 this situation at St F.
 
 I confirmed the fence installation for Wednesday 11/8 at 1:15pm. I will be
 at an HCA luncheon that morning for 1 hour of CE and should be finished in
 time to be at the house by then.
 
 Any thought on what you would like for dinner?
 
 Neil
