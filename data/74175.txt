 
 Here are my observations:
 
 I'm not certain that an Enron entity will provide a performance guaranty.  I 
 agree that the commercial deal is that a portion of the fee will be at risk 
 for a performance problem.
 
 Is the reference to the "State" a reference to the DPUC or CRRA?
 
 As far as I know, the CRRA deal is still in the works, with nothing but a 
 confidentiality agreement (with an exclusivity provision) signed, and in my 
 opinion should not be presented as being a done deal.
