 (Friday) afternoon, the Governor exercised eminent domain over the IOU 
 forward contracts that the PX had been in the process of auctioning to pay PX 
 participants.  I would like Bracewell to research at least the following two 
 possible ways this action is unlawful.  First, this violates the banking 
 provisions of the PX tariff (Section 6).  These provisions requires the PX to 
 hold all PX accounts in trust for PX participants.  Second, these are 
 wholesale contracts and the State only has the right to exercise eminent 
 domain concerning retail service.  I don't have any law to support the second 
 idea but think it should be researched nonetheless.
