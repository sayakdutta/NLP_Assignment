 
 Dear Mr. Jackson-
 
 I am writing to request that the City of West U postpone the proposed work at Colonial Park until at least late May 2002.  Over 50 girls involved in the West U Softball Association  practice at the field from February through May every year.  At this late notice, it would be very difficult for WUSA to find a replacement field near West U.  What's the harm in delaying the work a couple of months??  West U prides itself on its focus on community and families; what's more community-minded than allowing youth sports to use public park space?
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Susan Pereira
