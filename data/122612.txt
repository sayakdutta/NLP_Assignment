 In a effort to expedite the materials for Questar I/C, can Questar look at what their time frame for getting the following material is to see if it would assist in getting the interconnect in service sooner.
 If they have any questions on material, have them call me.

 2) Denials single stream chromatograph, Model 2350, with test gas, Heater box for test gas, and controls.

 4) MECO H20 Monitor
 5) Building with heat/ac, general gas monitor, breaker with shunt, prewired. 10X10 Explosion proof
 6) 12" full opening W X W hot tap valve 600# - Cooper valves are preferred vendor by material management on all valves.
 7) 3 - 8" full opening ball valves 600#
