 Do you know what other business MG London Inc. is or anticipates doing with 
 these same counterparties?  It may make a difference if they are acting for 
 these customers as an FCM.

 Gentlemen, 
 
 I met with Craig Young (MG US) last week, who is keen to progress metals 
 business with large US corporates (e.g. Anheuser Busch), on the following 
 basis:
 
 o Assume ENA and US Corporate are existing parties to ISDA/Credit Support 
 Documents (the "Master").
 
 o ENA and US Corporate would agree to expand range of OTC products to include 
 OTC metal derivatives under the Master.  The principals to the metals trades 
 would therefore be the US Corporate and ENA.  These trades would however be 
 "arranged" by MG London Inc. (an FCM) as "arranger" in the US for ENA.
 
 o Enron Metals Limited (EML) from London would agree to provide metals prices 
 to ENA and/or MG London Inc. in the US, and in return receive a commission 
 from MG London Inc.
 
 o ENA would back-to-back OTC metals derivatives with EML via an intra-group 
 ISDA Master.
 
 Look forward to your views.
 
 Thanks.
 Justin
