 
 Jodi,
 
 Chris can set up a conference call with myself, Stinson Gibner and Zimin Lu 
 to discuss
 the real option applications. My assistant Shirley Crenshaw, 3-5290, will be 
 glad to help him.

 Per my voicemail, the following is the message I received from Chris Swenson 
 about the Kellogg Class he is trying to form.  Please let me know if you 
 would be able to help him.  Thanks.

 Hi Jodi,
 
 I have been remiss in keeping up with you and letting you know what is
 going on
 in my little world here at Kellogg.
 
 In other matters, life at Kellogg has me very busy at the moment.  I am taking
 a full load, including Fin Decisions and am helping Prof. Petersen write a new
 class called Advanced Valuation, which will be offered in the spring.  A big
 part of the focus of this class is going to be on real options, which is cool
 stuff.  And as poor as my timing is, I would like to ask you a
 question/favor.
 For purposes of this class, do you think it would be possible to obtain
 some of
 Enron's thoughts on real options?  I was thinking, for example, that a
 fuel-switching analysis would be neat to included in the case packet.  Of
 course, none of the numbers or names need be real-- only the concepts.  Well,
 let me know what you think of that-- who knows, Enron might actually like the
 free exposure.
 
 
 All the best,
 
 Chris
