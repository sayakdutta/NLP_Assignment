 We may use 1 workstation in London, 1 in Houston.
 
 Yes, please call Ms. Geman and ask for more detailed price information.

 Hello Vince,
 
 I didn't know if that was your correct e-mail address listed below on 
 receiving from outside the company, so I thought I would forward this with a 
 couple of comments.
 
 She states below that she has enclosed a proposal, however, the only pricing 
 I really see is in the Software License Agreement, Article 2, which states 
 that the license fee is $100,000 and lists out when you must pay for it.  It 
 then states in Article 3 that the fees are set forth in Appendix 1, but there 
 are no prices in Appendix 1.  
 
 I have reviewed the actual terms and conditions to the license and am going 
 to prepare it as we usually do to send to Mark Holsworth for review.  In the 
 meantime, do you want me to go back to Ms. Geman and ask her for more 
 detailed pricing information or do you have what you need?  Also, in Appendix 
 2, you will need to list the number of sites and workstations you want to 
 have.  
 
 Please let me know.
 
 Thanks,
 Karla

 Dear Ms.Feldman,
 Please find enclosed a proposal for the D-G Energy
 Software license agreement in which Enron may be
 interested.We deliberately left blank the Appendix 2
 related to the number of sites and workstations it
 would cover ,in order to let Dr.Kaminski decide what
  is best for Enron.
 Sincerely
