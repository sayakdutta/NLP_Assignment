 Attached please find the execution copies of both O&M Agreements.  The only 
 change I have made is the one we discussed at the end of Section 8.4.  Please 
 let me know if you wish to discuss.
 
 Jay, unfortunately, I would just print out these documents in lieu of the 
 hard copies I previously gave you. However, keep and use the budget schedules 
 I gave you.
 
 Best regards.
