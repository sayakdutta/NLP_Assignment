 Thrilled to hear all is going well.  I would love to play tennis anytime 
 (hopefully sooner rather than later so I can take advantage of  that 
 lingering fatigue that takes months? years? to abate).  We can play at the 
 Met either around lunchtime or sometime after 4:00.  Weekends would also 
 work.  Can you play next Tuesday or Wednesday?  Call or write.
 
 See you soon
