 I have no contacts to buy from.  Mountaineer production is normally sold on 
 term deals.

 CES needs 17dts/day of Mountaineer gas for the rest of March.  The request 
 was made by Kim Novesak??
 
 I will be out this afternoon.  Please call Brian Perrone (703-561-6486) or 
 Scott Goodell at 713-853-7711.
 
 Thanks
