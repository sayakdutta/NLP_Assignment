 I am a recruiting co-ordinator with the Associate and Analyst Programs.  We 
 are looking for additional offices within which to conduct interviews this 
 Saturday, November 4th.  We are bringing in over 80 candidates and are in 
 need of interview rooms.  Many of Enron's Executives and VPs recognize the 
 importance of the success of this event and have lent their offices to us for 
 these interviews.  However, many more offices are needed.  The interview 
 process begins at approximately 9:00 a.m. and will conclude by 1:00 p.m. that 
 Saturday.  If you are concerned about the sensitive nature of some of the 
 materials in your office, we ask that you simply move the confidential 
 documents to one side of your desk and/or credenza.  We will see that the 
 materials are turned "face down" or covered with a blank piece of paper so as 
 not to disturb their original state.  Unlike previous years, the Enron 
 interviewers will be in the designated offices at all times with the 
 candidates.   All offices will be locked after the completed interview 
 process.  Please let me know the availability of your office for interviews 
 at your earliest convenience.    We encourage your participation and 
 appreciate your support.
