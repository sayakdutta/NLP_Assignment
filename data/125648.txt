 I asked Steve and here is what he sent me.
 
 
     
 
 Hi Andy and happy new year...
 
 I chose one in NJ for my own use.
 
 I did get some recommendations from some other people that were NY lawyers:
 
 Jerry Solomon at Gallet, Dryer & Berkey 212-935-3131.
 
 I have another somewhere, and I'll try to send it along.

 A friend who works in New York asked if I could recommend an attorney who
 does Will/Estate preparation. Do you have any recommendations ?
 
 Thanks,
 Andy
 
 p.s. Happy New Year !!
