 Our new fundies group is 100% better in terms of data quality and presentation. 
 
  
     
 Kevin,
 
 Can I get a copy of the market fundamentals (capacity additions/retirements, load growth, proposed RTO structure, etc.) for the southeast power market?  I want to try to get a jump start before my move to the desk.
 
 Thanks.
