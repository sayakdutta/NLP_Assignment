 California's spiraling energy crisis, already menacing the state's economy 
 and sucking billions of dollars out of the state treasury, has dramatically 
 shaken Californians' confidence in their future and their governor, a new 
 poll shows. 
 Nearly half of the state's residents now believe California is headed in the 
 wrong direction, a stunning reversal from just five months ago, when nearly 
 two-thirds believed the state was headed in the right direction, according to 
 the poll conducted by the Public Policy Institute of California. 
 And bearing the brunt of this new pessimism is Gov. Gray Davis, whose 
 approval ratings have plummeted to 46 percent, down from 63 percent in 
 January, when the San Francisco-based institute conducted its last poll. 
 ``We have seen slow deteriorations in public attitudes during tough times in 
 the past,'' said Mark Baldassare, who directed the survey. ``But what is most 
 surprising is the speed at which this change has occurred. . . . It is very 
 dramatic.'' 
 Indeed, the energy crisis now dominates all other issues confronting 
 Californians, according to the survey of 2,001 residents statewide. 
 Forty-three percent of respondents listed electricity as the most important 
 issue facing the state, compared to just 13 percent who identified growth and 
 6 percent who identified education as the next most important issues. In 
 recent years, Californians have consistently ranked education as their top 
 issue. 
 And nearly two thirds of respondents said they fear the issue of supply, 
 demand and cost of electricity will hurt the California economy ``a great 
 deal.'' 
 ``Without electricity we can't do much of anything, especially work, and 
 without work the economy will continue to tank,'' said Maria Griffiths, a 
 46-year-old juvenile court clerk in San Jose. 
 Results dismissed 
 The governor's top political adviser, Garry South, dismissed the findings as 
 predictable. ``The voters are in a very bad mood. They are not happy with 
 anyone in this drama,'' South said. ``But these poll numbers need to be taken 
 in context. . . . People don't understand what he's done because it is very 
 hard to communicate that in this state.'' 
 South emphasized that he believes Californians will understand the extent of 
 Davis' efforts by the time they go to the polls next year. Davis is expected 
 to run for re-election next year, and several Republicans, including 
 Secretary of State Bill Jones, are already lining up to challenge him. Davis 
 also has his eyes on the presidential election in 2004. 
 The survey found that most Californians do not blame Davis for the current 
 electricity crisis. Only 10 percent say he and the current Legislature are 
 culpable, compared to 32 percent who blame the utilities and 26 percent who 
 blame former Gov. Pete Wilson and the legislators who passed California's 
 landmark deregulation five years ago. 
 ``He didn't make the deregulation disaster. I think that's Pete Wilson's 
 legacy,'' said John Putica, 52, a bank loan officer in San Jose. 
 Criticism for Davis 
 But there are nonetheless troubling signs for the man charged with leading 
 California out of its power troubles. 
 Sixty percent of those polled said they disapprove of how Davis is handling 
 the power crisis, much to the delight of Republicans who have hammered the 
 governor for not doing more. 
 Davis has emphasized that the solution to the state's electricity crisis 
 involves more power plants, more conservation and federal intervention to 
 control the price that California is being forced to pay for power. 
 The state has approved 15 new power plants since Davis was elected. But for 
 the past several weeks, the governor has been fighting an escalating war of 
 words with the White House over President Bush's unwillingness to support 
 price caps on electricity. 
 Bush's energy plan released last week again rejected price controls and 
 focused instead on rapidly boosting the nation's supply of power. 
 The Public Policy Institute of California's survey found that 43 percent of 
 Californians believe that new power plants offer the best solution to the 
 crisis. 
 But there is far less support for either conservation or price caps; 18 
 percent identified conservation as the most important solution, and just 8 
 percent favored federal price controls on generators. 
 That news was warmly received by a representative of power generators, who 
 have been accused by Davis and others of artificially inflating the price of 
 power to mine the California market for excessive profits. 
 ``I think the public is skeptical of the actual benefits of trying to cap the 
 price of power,'' said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the 
 Independent Energy Producers Association. Electricity generators argue that 
 price caps will discourage the construction of more power plants. 
 Backing re-regulation 
 Meanwhile, consumer groups, who have been advocating for re-regulation of the 
 electricity market, were left to hope that support for more controls will 
 come when Californians' power bills start rising next month. 
 ``People don't yet understand that generators are responsible for cutting off 
 the juice,'' said Harvey Rosenfield of the Santa Monica-based Foundation for 
 Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. ``But in three weeks, California is going to 
 face a catastrophe. This is going to hit supernova status. . . . Once people 
 understand what the causes are here, I think they will understand that the 
 only solution will be re-regulation.'' 
 Whether they will trust the state to come up with a solution is unclear, 
 however. 
 ``The electricity problem has not only had major consequences on how people 
 view their leaders and their short-term future,'' said Baldassare of the 
 Public Policy Institute of California. ``There is less confidence in the 
 state's ability to plan for the long-term future. And that is giving people 
 worry. 
 ``This crisis and the general economic uncertainty have severely undermined 
 public confidence in California's future and its leaders.''
