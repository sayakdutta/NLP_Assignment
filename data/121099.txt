 
 Good morning!  Got your message last night when I got home from the game.  Didn't want to wake you up.  How was your day yesterday?  Mine was very busy - lots of things going on.  Hopefully some tickets and $$$ will come out of all of it!  Anyway - I hope you have a good day today!  Talk to you later -
