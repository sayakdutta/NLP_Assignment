 
 I am sort of bummed about not going matchbox - but I will see them next year.  Dinner and Downtown sounds like fun, since I will be staying downtown - with no car!  Don't know when I will get there yet.  Is there anything in particular that I should come in early for?  I think fuller gets in town in the afternoon.  Should I pack my bike, skis, and golf clubs?  or just my drinking goggles?
 
  
     
 Really, I'm going to the Matchbox 20 concert up here on the 18th.  If you want let's look to eat dinner and then party downtown.   Do you feel like doing anything in particular?  (Mountain Biking, Golf, Skiing, Massive Drinking, etc)
