 I talked to Steve.. we won't respond, but I'm passing the letter along to Ben Glisan's team so they can follow up w/ Calpers.
 
  
     
 I don't think that Govt Affairs should do anything on this (and not sure if there is anything to do).
 
 
  
     
 I saw the letter from Peace to CalPERS.  As far as I know, Peace can't force CalPERS to do anything, including file a shareholder suit.  Therefore, I'm not sure if we gain anything by responding, or taking other action.  Thoughts?
 
 Best,
 Jeff
