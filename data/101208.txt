 than a 3-month period.  This phrasing is of course misleading; TW's daily 
 firm contracts are always for a term of just one day, but renew for 
 consecutive one-day terms unless terminated.  The discount letter, on the 
 other hand, grants a discounted rate for each of the one-day terms for a 
 certain period of time (typically one month).  Steve Harris wants to be able 
 to "sell daily firm for a one-year period."  In contractual terms all this 
 would mean is that the contract is for renewabable one-day terms (as usual), 
 and the discount applicable to such terms would be effective for one year.  I 
 see no problem with this, do you?  (Apparently the current perception in 
 marketing is that regulatory/legal was limiting daily firm to a 3-month 
 period.)
