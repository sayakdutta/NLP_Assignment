 Vince-
 
 I have a simplified version of Brad's model in mind.
 
 The "no arbitrage" condition equates trading margins across the country. 
 Costs of transmission rise with congestion on the network. Wellhead supply is 
 almost completely price- elastic, while burner-tip demand is almost 
 completely price inelastic. Storage is rationalized as a perpetual call 
 option.
 
 The least time-variant parameters are the costs of injecting and withdrawing 
 gas from storage to the pipeline, followed by the costs of delivering gas 
 from the wellhead to the pipeline. The intermediate-variant parameters are 
 the capacity-dependent costs paid to the pipeline (above shrinkage) for 
 transmission. The most time-variant parameters are the trading margins and 
 the valuations of the storage option.
 
 There are 8 parameters to be estimated at each major node of the betwork. 
 They are identifiable in either of two straightforward ways: using a short 
 time series of the last 3 days prices based on the assumed variability 
 mentioned above, or point-estimates ("calibrations") using only today's data 
 based on a node-based model of competition between pipelines where pipes with 
 the same region of origination, albeit markedly different terminus, price 
 versus capacity similarly, "competing" for outflows.
 
 I will write this up for you in Scientific Word and present it to you at your 
 earliest convenience.
