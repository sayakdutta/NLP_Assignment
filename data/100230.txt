 Kevin agrees with leaving the language in the agreement's.
 
 
 

    
 
 I'm comfortable with the language.  I will get it pushed through on this
 side.  Let's get it done.

 Even though we have changed the reimbursement from 50 / 50 on both
 interconnects
 to each entity paying 100% of one interconnect I still feel the language
 requiring either party to reimburse the other if operational circumstances
 constrain the physical intent of the interconnect is still needed.  In this
 way
 both entities will be aligned in trying to insure both the receipt and
 delivery
 interconnects function as intended.  Please let me know if you disagree.
