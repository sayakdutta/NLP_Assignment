 
 Hope the presentation was a rousing success.
 
 For future reference I would highly recommend calling me on my cell phone (713-775-6472) instead of the apartment phone.  Lisa ALWAYS answers that phone...in fact, she usually doesn't even give me a chance if she's there (who on earth would be calling me?).
 
 We'll keep working on the "trip".  I'm sure something wonderful will come up and it will be a fantastic endeavor.
