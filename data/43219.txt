 We are in the process of closing with US Bank on our financing for the
 construction of the first phase of this project for $13 million.  We are
 working with the Enron Corp. - Corporate Financing group to obtain a corporate
 guarantee for the financing.  This project is currently in PGH2 and is part of
 what is being sold with PGE.  The financing guarantee will contemplate this
 sale and will allow for the assignment of the guarantee to the new buyer as
 long as they meet an agreed upon financial standards (ie. BBB+).  Since we are
 under ETS you or Stan might get questions on the project and I wanted to
 provide you an overview of the project.
 
 Mahendra Shah of our treasury group has had a conversation with Greg Caudell
 and Jim Newgard (both report to Tm Despain) at Enron Corp. Corporate Finance
 about the Enron Guaranty for the US Bank construction facility (up to $13
 million). He has forwarded to them, the US bank's draft of the Enron guaranty.
  They indicated that the guaranty would probably be redrafted by Clement
 Abrams using the standard Enron format.  
  
 If you have any questions on the District Cooling Project or need additional
 information we can set up a conference call and go over the various aspects of
 the project.  We also have the financial model available that we can forward
 to you that was reviewed and was the basis of Enron's approval.
