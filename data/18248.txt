 
 Greetings:
 
 On the call between Ken Lay and Bob Hertzberg, Hertzberb asked us to resend 
 any thoughts (and any more detail) we have on demand buy-downs.  I've 
 combined our on-line auction proposal with the "federal" solution recently 
 worked up for the Cheney meetings (I tailored it for California 
 consumption).  
 
 Hertzberg wanted it today in advance of meetings that he's having in 
 Washington next week.  Scott Governor will deliver this to Hertzberg's office 
 today.  Sorry for quick turn around, but if folks have comments, could you 
 send them to me pronto so that Scott can deliver to Hertzberg's office before 
 COB?  Thanks very much.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
