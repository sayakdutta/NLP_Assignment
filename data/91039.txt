 
 Purvi,
 
 Thanks for the note. I am still working.
 Should know more with in a week.
 Who would have thought that this would ever happen.
 Life outside of work is going great. I feel blessed about that
 to help me through these tough times.
 
 How are you doing, work and personally ?

 I've been thinking about you guys these past few days and hope and pray everything works out for you. Take care and let me know if I can help in any way.
