 Do you want alot of any one item, say hamburger? Maybe we can take two deer
 and sell some of what we don't want. I have asked and some folks in my
 office would like some. They would pay for processing. Are we going to split
 a pig with John this year? NM
 
 

  
 
 Neil,
 
 You have my proxy.  Please let Anthony know what you think.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
 
 Anthony,
 
 Venison would be tough to swallow without teeth.

 Since I bought Bobbi a spot on the deer lease we have a total of 6 deer to
 kill this year. If you want more than one deer your welcome to it. 6 is way
 more than we can eat. Unless we skip breast feeding and start the baby on
 deer meat.
 
 How do you want it processed?  1 or 2 deer?
