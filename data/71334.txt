 
 Al,
 
 When I asked the question, I was told that the invoices needed to go to 
 Jody.  If there's a desire for the invoices to go elsewhere, it will need to 
 be addressed with Lisa Bills, with Roseann Engeldorf being consulted.   I do 
 not know if the financing documents limit or otherwise specify the handling 
 of invoices.
 
 Hope this helps.
