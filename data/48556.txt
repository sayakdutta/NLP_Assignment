 
 Sheri,
 
 This project is very important to me.  However, I am pulled on a very important project for the next several weeks and won't be able to look at this at all.  I expect I am really the only one who will be giving you sustantive input.  As well, I have other design modifications we will need to incorporate.  I just wanted to give you a head's up because you are going to get ahead of me here for awhile.

 Everyone,
 
 Attached is the second set of screen designs with the Latin text and the links removed.

 Something to consider, we could replace the Latin text with a disclaimer for the system.
