 
 Shudeish, I spoke with Roger Kohn, Region IX EPA permit engineer, about the 
 time his agency will take to do the air permit reveiw for Kingman and 
 Flagstaff.  He stated that EPA normally gets the allowed 45 days to do the 
 permit review, however, at the request of the state agency, his office will 
 do an expidited review.  Because of the urgency of Transwetern desiring to 
 initiate construction, by this email, I am asking the ADEQ to request  an 
 expidited review  of the Kingman and Flagstaff air permits from the EPA.
 
 Again, thanks for your work and effort that you have put in on this project.
