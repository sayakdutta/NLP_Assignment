 Debra,
 
 I forwarded down to you the subject several months ago. We had a conversation a few weeks ago and you advised me it had been forwarded to someone for review. I still have not seen the documents back and have been advised by OGT that we can not nominate gas on that agreement until we return it to them.
 
 Would you be so kind to check on it.
 
 Thanks.
 
 Bryant
