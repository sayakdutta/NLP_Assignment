 Yes this is an Enron company.  You're right, just like old shoes and I hope everyone is well taken care of.
 
  
     
 Get out of here!!!!  Is this an Enron company?  If so, I am so happy for you Lizzie, I will certainly miss you.  You and I have been working together for years and it's just been so comfortable! (just like "old shoes") .  I wish you well and I know you'll do a great job!
