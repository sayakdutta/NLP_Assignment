 specific hours.  I get the impression that leaving 15 minutes past 5 really 
 bothers her.  Just watch, and see. 
 
 
 
    
  
 She told you she'd be there, but she didn't know where to go.  I get a bit of 
 attitude here  Didn't you say she was no nonsense.  Oh, and get this, Mary 
 Cook has asked if Chaundra has made up the list for assistants willing to 
 work overtime for her yet.  Apparently, Chaundra won't do the OT.  I only do 
 OT for my people, and I can't believe she doesn't have a better work ethic.
