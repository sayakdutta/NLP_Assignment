 to legal.  If you send us a credit worksheet, we can prepare a Master Firm 
 Purchase Sale Agreement and once it is signed then a confirm can be issued to 
 cover the proposed transaction; however, if you want us to work on the 
 confirm, please send us a hard copy of deal ticket.  Otherwise the deal 
 number is greek.
