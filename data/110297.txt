 
 To Whom This May Concern,
 
 I have spoken to a couple people in your sales department regarding the shipping of this order.  Delivery was withheld because I specified a residential address.  In response, I would like to have the order delivered to the apartment offices at the delivery location.  The address should read Manor Way Office, but reference the specified apartment number.  Pete and Christy should be notified via the submitted phone number of the timing of the delivery.  If the offices are still considered "residential" you are authorized to bill me for the additional surcharge, which I understand to be not more than $30. 
 
 Please feel free to contact me with any questions or comments.  713-853-047 (day)
