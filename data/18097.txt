 
 FYI.  From our folks in Sacramento:
 
 AB 1085 is AES' competitive default provider bill.  It's not an emergency 
 bill, so it will be dealt with throughout the remainder of the spring and 
 summer.
 AB 57 is a legislator's suggestions on how long-term contracts should be 
 "regulated."  Also no an emergency bill.
 AB18X is an emergency bill and it would create a core/noncore split in 
 electricity similar to the one that exists in California's gas market.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
