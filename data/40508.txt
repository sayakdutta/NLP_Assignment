 
 In order for me to effectively represent you at the ETS PRC  and for some of 
 you at the Accounting and Finance PRC's I will need some information from 
 each of you.      Please send the following to Kathy Campos who will put it 
 together for me in a book.
 
 1. Copy of your goals for 2000 and the latest status.
 2. A list of accomplishments/things you are proud of this year, specifically 
 indicate any involvement in the    Associates/Analysts Program or the 
 Recruiting Program.
 3. Copy of a Self Evaluation you completed in the PEP System.
 4. Your Supervisor will provide me with a Copy of a Preliminary Evaluation.
 
 I will need these by the 29th of November for those in the accounting and 
 finance ranks.   For all others I will need the input for the 13th of 
 December.
