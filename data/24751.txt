 A couple of other quick things. My October Sumas position doesn't look correct. I am short 45000 mm/d and the report shows 50000 mm/d. I will list my oct sumas trades below if you can check on it for me. Also can you make sure my gas daily book is set up and include the change in position report in your daily e-mail.
  
 Thanx,
  
 Chris
