 
 I would like to change my parking contract from the Clay garage to the Allen 
 Center garage.
 
 Thank you,
 Robin

 We have spaces available at the Allen Center Garage for $89.00 per month, 
 payroll deductible. If you are interested, please reply via e-mail ASAP by 
 5:00 p.m., Monday, August 7.
 
 Your parking access card will be ready for pick-up on Tuesday, August 8.
 
 If you are currently parking in a garage that is subsidized by Enron, you 
 will need to turn in that access card in exchange for an Allen Center access 
 card.
