 Mike and Jeff:
 
 Every Wednesday, we have a team seminar where our group reviews topics of 
 interest and relevance to our markets and our company. It is my goal to use 
 these seminars as a learning and information exchange tool. The weekly topics 
 range from instructional (basics of swaps and futures) to team-building 
 exercises.  With this in mind, I was hoping that each of you could commit to 
 a Wednesday seminar for 1 hour to review your careers at Enron and discuss 
 what you did to become successful. The seminars are open to all analysts / 
 associates in EGM/ ENA trading. I intend to ask each  EGM  business head to 
 participate as well. I am hoping that your seminars will work as an informal 
 mentoring exercise as providing guidance to our new people on how to have a 
 successful career.
 
 
 The seminars usually begin at 4 p.m. I hope each of you will participate. 
 Please let me know your availability. There is no need to bring a 
 presentation, as the meetings are very informal.
 
 Thanks
 Jen
