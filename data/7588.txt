 
 I have heard through the grapevine that you produce a weekly status report on 
 the MG aquisition and assimilation.  Would you please include me on that 
 distribution list effective this week?   I believe that it is assumed that 
 Fernley Dyson will have day-to-day responsibility for this business once the 
 aquisition is completed.  However, in my role over Global Risk Management 
 Operations, I find myself fielding questions regarding our assessment of 
 operations and any issues surrounding assimilation.  Brent Price, who reports 
 to me and is on temporary assignment in the London office, has been keeping 
 me updated on progress to date.  His return soon to Houston, however, will 
 create a potential information gap that the weekly status report may help to 
 fill.  
 
 Thanks in advance to your attention to this.
