 Dear Vince,
 
 How are you?
 
 I am just wondering whether you have received the
 email I sent to you a couple of weeks back.  In that
 email, I asked whether you would have time to write me
 a recommendation letter to support my application for
 a Master Program (Mathematical Finance) in Columbia
 University this coming fall.  If you will be able to
 write the letter, would you please let me know?
 Thanks a lot.
 
 
 Best Regards,
 
 Vincent Tang
