 Morris, I am forwarding two PAA formats for your review.  Jason and Nancy developed an agenda for reviewing O&M reporting requirements for our Field Point Persons that took them through the steps of reporting, forecasting and current estimating, not only as it relates to our requirements, but to those of Elaine's shop as well.
 
 I recommend your approval.
