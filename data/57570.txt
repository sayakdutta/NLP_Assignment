 FYI:
 
 Early next week, EES is filing an environmental permit for a gas fired or 
 diesel 50 megawatt mobile, temporary generation
 "facility" in Gallup, New Mexico.  We anticipate that we will use gas, but in 
 either case, we will not pass the emmissions threshold.
 Obviously diesel will provide less generation.   Enron currently has a gas 
 compressor on site and we own the land.  
 We are seeking to deliver the power to markets in the west. This will serve 
 the Palo Verde region.  Jim Steffes has been
 advising as to the local permitting processes.
 
 I will keep you in the loop as we proceed.  We will probably look to permit 
 other such generation facilities in the west.
