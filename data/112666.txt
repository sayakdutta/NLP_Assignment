 Someone from CSC was on the call (Allison Hafner).  
 
 TXU said the meters were to be read by Dec 13 with final EDI files sent to ERCOT by Dec 14.  ERCOT would process a REP of Record change on Dec 13.  
 
 Looks like everything is ok.

 We are all under pressure to operate in our current mode, but we are all still on the same team.
 
 Anything that I can do to help?

 Someone from EES needs to be on this conference call.  I will not be babysitting to make sure someone does sit in, so the responsibilty is yours to take care of the drop to POLR.  The desk has done all it can do regarding this subject.
