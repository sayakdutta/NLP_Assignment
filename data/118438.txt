 Long Descriptions.  Dave Forster will be forwarding them to you.  Please 
 resend the language once those changes are incorporated.
 
 Thanks!

 Attached below please find language suggested for use for a AECO Daily Price 
 Index for a Balance of Month transaction from Canada. I have reviewed the 
 suggested changes and validated  the pricing language against the Price 
 Source and consider it accurate.

 Dale,
 
 Attached is the revised balance of the month product information.  In the 
 first paragraph, there is a line which needs to be deleted and I have 
 highlighted this line in red.  As well, the second paragraph has two minor 
 changes also highlighted in red.
 
 If you have any questions, please let me know.  Otherwise I would appreciate 
 knowing when this is available so that I can advise Jon McKay.
 
 I have asked Jon about the same day and weekend products and he said he 
 hasn't checked to see if they have been set up.  Once he has, he will let me 
 know and I will then let you know.
 
 Thanks!
 
 Dianne
