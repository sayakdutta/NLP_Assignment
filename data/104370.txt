 until the U.K. corporate agent is actuallly formed, there is nothing further 
 that I can do.  That formation should happen today or tomorrow.  With the 
 actual name and agreements with ENA and ECT Investments, Inc., I can provide 
 that information to Instinet and the other trading platforms you are 
 interested in transacting on.  Just FYI, the Instinet people are merely 
 waiting for the agent agreement in order to proceed. 
 
 Please let me know if you have any further questions.  Sara
