 We can find no record that the above entity has filed market based rates with 
 FERC as required by the Federal Power Act. Suggest that we notify them that 
 we can find no record of any such filing and as a consequence of which will 
 need to turn them off from the being able to sell on EOL, however they can 
 continue to purchase and once they have made, or can demonstrate to us that 
 they have made the requisite filing with FERC, we will open them up for sell 
 transactions as well.
  
 Regards,
  
 Marcus
