 I can't sleep and have been cleaning out emails.  Not my favorite past time 
 at 2:30am.  I didn't see the draft reorg memo we've been talking about for a 
 while.  Please send it to me for my review.  I think it is important to get 
 something out and i believe that people expect some changes
 Thanks, m.
