 
 Tom,
 
 Attached are the graphs for energy lost due to the pitch and overspeed faults 
 you listed. As I mentioned before the methodology requires decent data 
 recovery for the 10-minute data. The data recovery was poor for several sites 
 in January, and for Fenner and Klondike in May. 
 
 I will be compiling a report on this request, summarizing the graph types and 
 some explanation of the methods used to produce them. I hope to have that 
 completed within the next couple of days.
 
 If you see deficiencies or suggested modifications let me know.
 
 Mark
