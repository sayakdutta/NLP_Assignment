 Don, the ENA WTI swap which you booked for TBS needs to be rebooked into 
 another entity which is totally controlled by Enron.  John Novak and I 
 thought that perhaps the most appropriate entity would be Enron South America 
 LLC.  Please confirm if this is the entity you want the trade booked with.  
 If so, you will need to have John Mee prepare an amended deal ticket.  
 
 Joe, can you confirm that Enron South America LLC is an eligible swap 
 counterparty (1mm in net worth or 10mm in assets)?  
 
 If anyone else has any questions, comments or issues please respond as 
 quickly as possible.  This deal was closed on January 13 and needs to be 
 documented.  
 
 Thanks,
 Brent
