 Richard,
 I do not know this person personally, but I know very well the corporate 
 culture  and the law firm culture from which he comes.  He has worked for 
 TransCanada and the law firm of Walsh Young.    You probably need to discount 
 the probative value of my comment as being too vague and subjective,  but all 
 things considered, I would give a thumbs down to this guy, and suggest that 
 we try to get someone from one of the firms up there.    Please call if you 
 are interested in general background comments. ----cgy
