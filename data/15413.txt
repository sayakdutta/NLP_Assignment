 Hello Gang,
 
 I am leaving town Wed, not to return until Monday.  So I will work on the 
 next case tonight (early questions) and send what I have to the team.
 
 According to our schedule, I am supposed to be coordinating this 
 case.  Jeff - can I switch this one with the Daimler-Chrysler case 
 (assigned to you)?
