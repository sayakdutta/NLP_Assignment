 Hello Dana,
 
  I trust that all is well for you and yours.  I'm e-mailing you to get a
 message to Kevin for me about Lay Speaker's School.  As Kevin may be
 aware there is a two year membership rule within the book of discipline
 before an individual can apply for the ordained ministry within the
 United Methodist connection.  Until such time that he has been a member
 for  two years he may want to attend the Lay Speaker's School on March
 17th and 25th that will give him some training in some strategic areas of
 ministry that will provide him with some additional tools to use in his
 quest for the ministry.
  If he is interested please ask him to contact me for more information.
 I've been meaning to tell him directly but everytime we are together I
 forget about it.  So since I'm at the computer I decided to e-mail you so
 that you can remember (smile).
  Thanks for everything!
