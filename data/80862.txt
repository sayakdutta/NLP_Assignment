 Thanks for the email.  Yes it was a very difficult decision to leave our 
 group.  I've really enjoyed working with you and your group;  I think we have 
 a great group.   I know you that you are working on  this side of the 
 business already and I will be giving you a call to get your input and 
 direction.
 
 Cheers,
 Mike
