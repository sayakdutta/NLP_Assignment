 Mary -- We had talked about having the business unit CEOs talk about the two or three slides covering their business.  I think it would be a good way to broaden the management team and give them exposure with employees.  Could we work that in?  thx. kd

 Steve/Karen/Cindy:  See Ken's response below.  
 
 Cindy, let's talk about the survey results.
 
 Also, Steve, I hope we can talk about our business strategy.  This is something employees have asked us for.  Can you help me with this?  Thanks.
 
  
     
 Mary:
 
 We'll key off of the 3rd quarter financial presentations but add 3 or 4 slides on employee survey and what we're doing about it.

 Ken, Greg and Mark:
 
 Our next all-employee is scheduled for Oct. 23 at 10 a.m at the Hyatt Regency Houston.  Steve Kean asked me send you a reminder about the meeting and for you to be thinking about messages for both our investors and our employees.  This will help when compiling the presentation slides.  
 
 Also, please let me know if all of you plant to participate in giving the presentation.  Thanks.
