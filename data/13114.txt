 
 Welcome to the heat!!! 
 
 If you would re-send your resume to me, I'll re-send it to my contacts here 
 in town and let them know that you now are available.  I think I may have a 
 firm that could use your skills!

 Hi Michelle
 
 I hope that you are well. Just to update you, I am now based in Houston 
 permanently.
 
 I am still following up the leads you kindly provided me with. However I 
 would be grateful if you would consider me for any suitable future positions 
 which you become aware of.
 
 Many thanks for your continuing assistance.
