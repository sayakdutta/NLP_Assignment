 
 Apologies, but I'm trying to make sure that I have the meeting times right.
 
 Monday 10:30 AM CDT--"All hands" meeting with business folks.
 Monday 3 PM CDT--Washington Call
 Tuesday/Thursday 1:30 PM CDT--California Call
 Thursday 4 PM CDT--Leadership call
 
 Do I have these right?
 
 Thanks a million.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
