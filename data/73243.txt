 We need the Master Gas Agreement between Yazoo and ENA executed ASAP !!
 In the last meeting, it was stated that for Clarksdale we would have the 
 third party supplier invoice
 the Cities directly, however once the Yazoo rehab work was completed, ENA 
 would be supplying and
 invoicing Yazoo.  Yazoo is near completion on the work, and has already 
 burned gas in their testing over
 the past weekend. I currently have an imbalance with the pipe which  I need 
 to repay ASAP.  Also once the 
 Yazoo unit is completed, I have NO MECHANISM to deliver the gas until we 
 execute the Master Gas as
 was discussed two weeks ago.
