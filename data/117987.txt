 Mark:
 
 After our last discussion from Friday I thought I would outline the next 
 Steps as I see them:
 
 ? Establish a corporate entity as a sub of Enron Corp. to conduct business 
 under.
 ? Develop a consulting contract (Sample sent to you by Cassandra Schultz)
 ? Develop a confidentiality agreement from sample provided.
 ? Price Professional Liability Insurance based on contract provided.
 ? Hold off customers until said items are in place.
