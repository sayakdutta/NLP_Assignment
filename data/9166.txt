 Just to confirm that Mark Frevert has blocked out 9am-10am on Friday, 16th 
 June for the internal conference you are arranging.  He said that you will be 
 sending over further details by the end of this week, would you mind sending 
 them to me so that I can pull them off for his return on Monday?
 
 Thank you
