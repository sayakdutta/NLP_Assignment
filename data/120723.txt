 I agree they won't want 200,000 but I want to make sure they don't throw it out because the volume is too high.  Otherwise you're OK with it?
 
  
     
 I would probably drop the range volume and go with a specific amount... 10,000 - 25,000 instead of up to 200,000 as I am sure there is no way they will get that high.

 Steph,
 
 Here's my proposal for Valero.  Would you (& legal?) like to review it before I send it?
