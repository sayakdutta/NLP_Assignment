 hahaha.  I am talking to Bosse on the phone and both of us fell out of our chairs with that one...You kill me chef Vito.

 P.S. Bosse said bring your ass to New Orleans
 
 
  
     
 I should hire you as a travel agent.
 
 
 
     
 
 I just saw a fare from SD for $68 roundtrip....I have to seriously consider
 moving out there if it is that cheap to go to Vegas.

    I hope they move to L.A.  GO RAIDERS
 
    
                 
 
    that is absolutely hilarious.  I have heard a rumor that the Chargers
    are
    considering moving to LA....Is that correct?  That will be absolutely
    horrendous.  I saw the game of the century the other day on ESPN
    classics...Chargers vs. Dolphins 1983.  Truly awesome.  My man at the
    time
    Winslow(racist) got carried off three times.

       I can not open the file...Is this the kid from the man show selling
       beer?
       I have also seen him trying to buy beer.
