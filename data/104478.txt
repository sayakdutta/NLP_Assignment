 
 Tanya:  I just returned from vacation.  What happened with SITA?  Did we 
 execute a transaction (in the name of ECTRIC) on a Deemed ISDA (with or 
 without credit?).  I didn't see an entry in Lotus Notes.  Sara

 Further to my fax of 3 October we have SITA's instructions.
 
 1 - Credit Support Annex :
 
 SITA's position is unchanged. SITA does not wish to have a Credit Support 
 Annex.  SITA have asked that ENRON come up with a proposal on the term and 
 volume of the transactions on the basis of no Credit Support Annex.
 
 2 - SITA does not provide investment services ancillary to its main 
 activities. Do you have any news regarding ENRON on this point?
 
 Kind regards
 Susan Hopkinson
