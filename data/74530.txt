 The landowner is "Gilda Mancini, individually, and Gilda Mancini, Lisa M. Jankowski and David A. Mancini, as Co-Trustees of the Richard Mancini Revocable Living Trust dagted April 24, 1973".
 
 Paul Jankowski is obviously related to Lisa.  Stuart, didn't you deal alot with Paul Jankowski as sort of the family spokesman?
 
  
     
 I am familiar with the Mancini option, but I don't know who this person might be.  Any ideas?
 
  
     
 Paul Jankowsky just called and wanted to talk to the attorney in charge of the Deerfield project.  He sounded a tad irate.
