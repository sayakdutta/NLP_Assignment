 room?  Its like psssst, I am out.  
 
 I have a couple of letters at the house for you.  I can forward wherever you 
 like.  Things are going fine for me.  I cry myself to sleep every night 
 screaming out Bruce, Bruce why did you leave me?
 
 Drop me a line and let me know how it is going.  Also do you have Tristan's 
 phone number?  Wanted to give him a call and see if he wanted to grab some 
 beers now and then.
