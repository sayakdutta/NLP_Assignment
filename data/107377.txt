 Thank you for meeting with myself and John Malowney today to discuss the opportunities for Enron and Tri-Met to work together.  As we discussed, in order for Enron to provide either physical or financial products as an Oregon Direct Access ESS provider, the EEI and ISDA contracts that we left with you today will need to be executed.
