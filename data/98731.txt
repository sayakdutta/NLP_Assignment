 Not only no, but hell no.  Once burned (badly), twice shy (exponentially).  
 The best and only development on NSM I would like to see is to get out the 
 litigation morass and (hopefully) be a little wiser next time.
 
 Seriously, if the project does get reorganized (sans Enron additional 
 investment), what does that mean in terms of any potential recovery for the 
 existing debt?  Presumably any reorganization would come out of a bankruptcy 
 plan.  Any hope?
 
 

  
  
 I have attached an e-mail from Steve Howard, our atty in the NSM litigation. 
 Schultes is the original CEO of NSM.  Let me know if you are interested.

 Schultes' lawyer has asked us if John can call an Enron business person
 concerning a possible investment by Enron in some reorganized form of the
 project that Schultes is pushing.  Think anyone at Enron is interested?  If
 so, who?
 
 We told the lawyer that John should not call unless we clear it with you
 first.
