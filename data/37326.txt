 offer this to everyone, I won't bring her.  I don't have a problem with it, 
 just wanted to see what you thought.

 What would you think about just Kristi coming?  I'm sure no one would have 
 any problems with that.  Especially since they got to bring someone to the 
 party last weekend.  Jeff is going too, I asked him about the budget and he 
 is totally fine with that.  Have people been asking if they can bring someone?
