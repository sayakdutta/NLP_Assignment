 are these in the swap forms bank so we can't alter them by mistake?

 Attached are the Multicurrency ISDA and applicable CSA forms in Word.  These 
 documents are for your internal use in study, negotiating and the like.  I 
 find it useful to be able to use search and find for concepts etc. in 
 negotiating and understanding the guide and definitions.  These documents are 
 not to be used externally, ie emailed as the "form," since we have a general 
 rule that we always utilize printed versions of the form with our internal 
 clients and external customers.
 
 
 
 
 Cordially,
