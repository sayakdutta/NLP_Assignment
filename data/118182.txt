 Attached are revised drafts of the New York PA and ETA, which have been 
 revised to reflect the latest Clifford Chance drafts and our discussion 
 yesterday.  We are unable to blackline these drafts, due to the fact that the 
 Clifford Chance drafts are not on our system (and we did not receive all of 
 them in any event).  Also, we have not yet received from Mark's office the 
 language on confirmations; we have taken a shot at it but can obviously 
 modify it after we get the language.
 
 Finally, we have attached a blackline of the "Legal and Privacy" statement, 
 reflecting some suggested changes.  We also note that, if this document is to 
 be "global", we will either need to decide on a single governing law or 
 delete choice of law entirely.
 
 Best regards.
