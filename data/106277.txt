 
 Thanks for your help.  I also left a message for Jeff because I was told that 
 he worked on the transaction.
 
 The name "Compagnie de Papiers Stadacona" ("Stadacona") does not appear on 
 the corporate database so I cannot verify that it is an Enron-owned entity.  
 
 The only question is:  Can we book the FX trade in the names of Stadacona and 
 RMT?
