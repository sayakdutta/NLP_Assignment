 Dear Monique,
 
 The gas processing plant has been shut down for many years and is in fact dismantled.  I would leave off any mention.
 There is an active compressor station in fact it was converted to electric from gas in 1999.
 There is still an active underground storage facility.  Capabilities have improved from what you have to the following:
 	Storage Capacity: 70 BCF to 115 BCF
 	Maximum Injection Capacity: 510,000 Mcf/d
 	Maximum Withdrawal Capacity:  1,400,000 Mcf/d
 Call 713-853-7705 if you have questions.
 
 	Jim Schwieger
