 Just wanted to double check that there will be no trading July 4th.  EOL wants to have the correct amount of support.
 
 Thanks,

 Hello Everyone,
 
 If you could all verify if there will be trading on July 4th, regarding your specific desk or commodity, it would be greatly appreicated.  July fourth is an Enron Holiday, and we want to make sure that we have appropriate coverage.  Thanks for your help.  TARA
