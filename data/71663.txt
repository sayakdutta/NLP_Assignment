 Ben/Mike,
 
 Please share this invite with the rest of the team that's been supporting
 the N. America business with LM6000s and other GE Power Systems products.
 I'll be there both nights.  Just have your folks just respond by e-mail so I
 can get you the passes and tickets.
 
 Thanks again for all your business,
 
 Lee Johnson
