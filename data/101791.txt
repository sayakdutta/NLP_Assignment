 
 Hey Bonnie,
 
 I talked to Pattie yesterday and asked her for more time to make a decision.  I have basically until the end of the month to get back with them.  I'm still trying to check out the other opportunities that might be out there.
 
 I spoke to Matt on Tuesday a bit over the computer...things are weird.  He said everything was okay, but I don't think that's really the case.  He wouldn't respond yesterday.  Oh well....c'est la vie.
 
 I'll talk to you soon and keep you updated,
 Susan
 
 Btw...that cute place on 4th Ave in Queen Anne was already rented.
 
  
     
 
 
 hi there:
 how are you doing? have you told the company anything yet? i am thinking you probably had to turn ole pattie down... was she devestated that you won't be her new BFF?
 
 let me know how it went, and i hope things are going well on the whole "looking for a job" front. I know it can be so frustrating.
 
 have you spoken with matt????  any more updates with that?
 
 happy valentines (even though it is a dumb holiday)
 
 Take care
 bonnie
