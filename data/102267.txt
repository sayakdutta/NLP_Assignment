 
 I believe Leslie does regulatory/legal work for ENA on a contract basis.

 I am not sure about Leslie Lawner but maybe Drew or Susan Scott know. I do 
 not get reports from anyone else regarding activities in any state.

 Steve - is Leslie Launer(sp?) an Enron employee?   I know she once was, but I 
 believe she lives in New Mexico and is used by Enron at times.  Do we use 
 her?  What is her status and relationship with the pipeline group??
 
 Do you get any reports from Tom Rutherford on New Mexico??
