 Sara, I didn't realize that Shari had left the financial swap group.  She 
 just sent me an e-mail telling me that she thought you were handling the 
 negotiation of ISDAs on behalf of Enron Canada, so I thought I would forward 
 this message I sent to Tana today for your information.
 
 Thanks
 
 Greg

 Tana, I received a request this week from Jannalyn Galloway of Reliant Energy 
 Services Canada, Ltd. to commence the process of putting an ISDA in place 
 between Enron Canada Corp. and Reliant Energy Services Canada, Ltd.  We 
 recently finalized a Master Physical Agreement between these parties and I 
 was wondering if you could commence the process of obtaining credit approval 
 to do the ISDA and provide a draft to Jannalyn.  Her fax number is 
 713-207-9663, her direct line is 713-207-5893 and her e-mail address is as 
 above.
 
 Thanks for you help on this and if you need anything further from me, let me 
 know.
 
 Greg
