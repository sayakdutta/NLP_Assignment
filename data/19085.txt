 Amen,
 Jeff
 
 P.S. Rory and Timi love Dr. Laura.

  This is a letter to the editor that appeared in the Cleveland Plain Dealer.  
 This is the letter in its entirety. For those in need of a reason to vote on 
 November 7, here are two: 1.      Because Matthew Shepard cannot. 
 2.      Because Dr. Laura can.
