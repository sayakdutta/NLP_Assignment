 (Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Years).  Just let me know who appropriate 
 contacts will be, especially for the DPR and MPR, during the dates that you 
 are out.  Sounds as if you should see a white Christmas!  --Sally

 Dear Sally,
 
 I'd like to take vacation from December 15 - 26 to goto Canada.  Please let 
 me know if this doesn't fit for some reason.
 
 Best regards,
