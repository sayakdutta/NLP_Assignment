 will ask to have it on 29, so you won't need to check there.
 
 Hope you've had a great weekend.  The weather was PERFECT!!!!

 How does everybody look for a discussion concerning the VEPCO interconnection 
 agreement on Tuesday, Sept 19?
 
 I've checked with Christi, Mitch and Reagan, so they don't need to confirm.
 
 Details to follow...
 
 Thanks,
