 As I'm sure you know we are trying to determine what is causing the Canadian 
 VAR to be so high.  One possible cause that we would like your help 
 investigating is the Curve Codes that are being loaded in the position files 
 that are manually loaded into the system each night.  It is my understanding 
 that positions will be correct even if the curves loaded are spelled  
 incorrectly. However, incorrect curve names will result in the positions not 
 being captured in the VAR calculation.  Please verify that all the curves are 
 spelled correctly in all position files.  
 
 Please give me a call if you have any questions.
 
 Thanks,
 Robin
