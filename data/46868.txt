 Tana, the contact that told me he had a electronic copy for BEA Weblogic just 
 dropped off a hard copy for me as he has not been able to locate the 
 electronic copy.  If you can send me a fax number I can fax this to you.

 Attached is what I hope is a pretty complete list of the EnronOnline 
 contracts I have been made aware of.  There are a few I have open questions 
 about  or am waiting to receive copies of the contract.  Can each of you 
 please take a look and think about whether there are any others we may be 
 missing.  Again, my time frame is short here, so if I can get your response 
 promptly I would be most appreciative.
