 Phillip,
 
 I am the recruiter you spoke to today about Chuck and other opportunities.
 Thanks very much for your time.  As discussed, I've attached my contact
 information for your records.
 
 You can find more information about my firm at www.firstcallassociates.com.
 We are very familiar with the nuances of the energy trading business and
 have built relationships with many energy companies in North America

 arrangements to talk again.  Thanks.
