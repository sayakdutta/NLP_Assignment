 Probably tomorrow (or we hope Thursday latest) we will be circulating a DASH 
 for approval to sell our interests in three seismic companies for total 
 consideration of approximately $2.5 million, net to Enron.  We have been 
 working on this transaction for several months and think we can get it 
 together this week.  Will you be available to review/sign this DASH this 
 week?  Thanks.  Dick.
