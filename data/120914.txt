 Is this fixed priced or gas daily calls.  If it is a gas daily call, is the strike fixed or FOM?  Is SMUD buying or selling?
 
  
     
 Sorry guys, I need to clarify my previous request.  SMUD is looking for a financial call option at Malin (or Aeco) with the strike 10% above today's market and 20% above today's market for 5000/day.  Term is April 01 through Mar 03.  Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kim
