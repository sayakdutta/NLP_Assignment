 
 Mark Haedicke and I would like to talk to her. Lauren Prescott sent her 
 resume to Chuck Cheek and she is scheduled to talk to them. I have left a 
 message with him to find out when Cheryl is going to be in the building. 
 Please call Twanda Sweet to set up a time (853-9402)

 Richard,
 
 Now that I've recovered from your bad news --  here's Cheryl Nelson's
 schedule as of this morning:
 
   she is still available any time next Wednesday (10/18), Thursday  (10/19),
 or Friday  (10/20), or the following Monday (10/23).
 
 Let me know what when you would like to schedule her.  She is very excited
 about Enron -- keeps hearing great things about the company.
 
 Thanks!
 
 Elaine
