 I remember hearing Jeff Rawls' name a few years ago, however I never new him. 
 I think he may have worked on the Texas gas desk, probably for Janet Dietrich.

 In Carey Jordan's deposition today, he mentioned that Paul Posoli was 
 recruited to become employed with Calpine in part because another former 
 Enron employee and current Calpine employee named Jeff Rawls recommended 
 him.  What, if anything, do you know about Jeff Rawls?
 
 Thanks.
