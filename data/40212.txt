 
 Attached find two drafts, one a redline/strikeout and the other a clean first 
 draft of the RTO West tariff glossary.  In addition to making the changes we 
 discussed to the Transmission Operating Agreement, I also took the liberty of 
 adding a number of definitions that I cribbed from the FERC pro forma 
 (changing "Transmisison Provider" to "RTO West" where applicable).  I 
 recognize that some of these definitions may not be applicable to the new 
 types of transmisison service but I thought if we made these definitions 
 available to the technical groups they could tell us if they needed them and 
 we would be assured that terms were used consistently with the FERC pro forma 
 and throughout the RTO West tariff.
