 
 In response to your e-mail of 4/12 regarding Hall Energy,   do NOT cancel the 
 GTC's without discussing same with the trader or business person for the 
 midwest. The original agreement (Hall  #96003960) contains very specific 
 pricing from that well for long term use.    I suspect the GTS were put into 
 place for alternative pricing or business reasons.  
 
 Nevertheless this is a business decision, therefore please talk to the trader 
 and business person regarding this issue prior to termination of the GTCs.
 
 If I can be of further assistance, please let me know.
