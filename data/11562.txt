 Is every contract entered into at ETS done with a DASH?  At TGS we enter into numerous transport contracts and they are not covered by a DASH?  In Central America we market our power out of the various plants and these contracts are not subject to a DASH.  Similar circumstances can be described at Promigas, Ventane, Calife, SK/Enron, Elektro and the Gas LDCs.  If what you describe is accurate, then we are not even close to compliance and the G&A investment necessary to comply will be huge.

 Jim- J Block was just a gas contract. At Enron, risk is controlled through one of two mechanisms: a book structure with approved limits and daily reporting of P&L or through a one off approval of a Dash. No risk should be taken on outside of these boundaries. Even though there is no capital, a gas contract contains market and credit risk and should be approved, providing it doesn't fit into a book.

 Michael - can you confirm it is needed.

 Help me understand why a DASH is being done for a gas contract?  The DASH process exists to approve uses of capital, not entering into a gas contract?  Am I missing something?
 
  
     
 Attached is the latest DASH we sent to RAC (Michael Tribolet) last night.  Thanks, Fede.

 Find attached the legal risk memo re this matter.  I believe the DASH for the matter has been distributed by Federico Cerisoli earlier this evening.  Please call or email with any questions.
