 
 Please coordinate with Linda Robertson -- I'd like her to be at meeting.
 
    Cc: Mike Steffes
  
 
 I spoke with Glenn English of the NRECA after our conversation this morning.
 Of the dates you are available for a meeting in DC, September 20th works
 best for him. Either Mike Steffes, ACES VP Trading & Marketing, or I will
 also attend. 
 
 Please confirm and let me know what time and place is best for you. 
 
 Thanks again for taking the time to visit with me this morning.
 
 David
