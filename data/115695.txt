 
 I just wanted to check in with you before changing these deals, since it's 
 been a few days since your e-mail. Tom Alonso wasn't in the office today and 
 I tried reaching him by phone to confirm. These are the prices he has in his 
 trade log, so as far as I can tell they are correct. Are you saying that 
 these prices need to be switched? Please let me know, and I'll fix it right 
 up.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate
