 As discussed, attached are three bid package documents reworked based on 
 today's discussions.  I will be priniting several copies and heading to the 
 31st floor so we can focus on any further required changes. The bid package 
 would also contain the Information Memorandum and the format Confidentiality 
 Agreement (redated and attached below). --David
