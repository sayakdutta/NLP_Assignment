 Michelle, Here's the training the NEPCO HR group has on their schedule.  I
 think the outcome of your meeting with Indivero and Schwartzenburg is that
 Mike would forward through me all requests involving the retention of
 outside counsel including the expected training needs from outside counsel.
 Let me know if you have any comments or suggestions.  Thanks.
