 
 In cleaning up e:mails, I can across this one from Sheila.  Is this one of 
 the corrections that was made to the June information?  Any update on July?  
 Thanks.

 Sheila / Scott,
 James asked me to forward you both copies of the June Operating Report, as 
 well as the list of data included in the report with the person responsible 
 for providing the information, which Sally discussed in her staff meeting 
 today.   If you have any questions, please let me know.
 Thanks,
 Brian
