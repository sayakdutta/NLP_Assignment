 7th straight record quarter...
  TMR out of tax deferrals so revenue  was 'only ' $.24 per share / $1.07 for 
 year.
 This does not include the 25 % of shares they took off market - that will be 
 factored
  into first qtr '01.  No reduction  in production for year - and looking for 
 increase
 in gas production for '01.
    Still looks good for long term...we'll see what it does the rest of this 
 week....
