 tomorrow.  I want to get Lee into this also.  Thanks.  DF
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
   
  
 Drew, thanks so much for your messages yesterday.  Received the e-mail and 
 look forward to discussing it with you - I definitely think I can fit it in 
 with my other work (at least I would like to give it a shot).  You know how 
 things go...  everything is supposed to happen at once but it never does.  Kim
