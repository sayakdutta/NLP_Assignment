 
 We will not be settling the El Paso/Stingray imbalance.  El Paso insists on 
 being paid back in kind, as opposed to cashing out at prices when the 
 imbalance occurred.  We'll just carry the imbalance on our books.  Maybe 
 we'll pay it back next year.
 
 Thanks,

 P.S.-  Was new paperwork sent out to Cinergy??
