 Hi there, following up from my call earlier...
 
 I am working as part of a team implementing financial trading agreements with our intra group counterparties. Part of that process involves contacting the directors of each enterprise and clarifying certain pieces of information. I know that you are a director of the following companies:
 
 Enron Trading Services Inc
 Enron Metals and Commodities Ltd
 Enron Metal Brokers Ltd
 Enron Metals Far East Ltd
 
 Could I ask that you confirm the following with respect to each company?
 
 Whose signature would be required on any new trading agreement for the company?
 Would there need to be a corporate resolution in order to sign the new trading agreement?
 
 Thanking you very much in advance for your time,
 
 Best Regards
 Lauren Christie
