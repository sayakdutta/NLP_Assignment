 Tanya:  I left you a voice mail earlier this week on the single outstanding 
 issue:  paragraph (B) of our setoff language.  This provision allows the 
 nondefaulting party to withhold any payment it might owe to the defaulting 
 party under the master until the nondefaulting party can be certain IN ITS 
 REASONABLE DISCRETION  that ANY other payments owed to it (under ANY other 
 agreements between the parties)  by the defaulting party have been paid.  
 Cargill does not want to "comingle" its business.  Remember, we have already 
 given in on "affiliate setoff".  [the lawyer never raised the paragraph (B) 
 issue until this week!] 
 
 Also, Cargill has requested that we change our Credit Support Amount 
 definition (but I provided them with an explanation) AND Cargill has decided 
 to issue transferable L/C's.
 
 Please let me hear from you so that we can finalize.  I do not know if this 
 is a deal breaker.
