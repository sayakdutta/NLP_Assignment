 
 Yes, these numbers are the posted volumes according to their bulletin board.  
 Update, as of 01/23...PG&ETop is 699 (61%), SoCalEhr is 1195 (96%), and 
 SoCalTop ios 538 (100%).  These volumes are slightly above last week's 
 posting.  I was told that the board was the official source for throughput 
 information; but, I will see if there is another source.

 Are you absolutely positive about these numbers? With all the problems in CA 
 how could El Paso not be flowing more at Topock? I know we are taking up part 
 of the space but it seems like they should be full to SoCal as well. Please 
 reconfirm with other sources.
