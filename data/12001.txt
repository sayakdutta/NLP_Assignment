 
 Shudeish with the state of Arizona just phoned and said that he and Probaht 
 Baragava are available to meet with us on Thursday at 2:00 pm.  This is the 
 only time and day of this week that they will be able to see us.  I asked 
 about whether Kathy OConnell and Nancy Wrona would be able to attend this 
 meeting and he stated that their calendars were full this week and would not 
 attend.   He will need to know by tomorrow whether to book this meeting and 
 who will be attending.  Sarah had mentioned that Thrusday was not a good day 
 for her.  Should we schedule this and if so, who will be attending in Sarah's 
 place?

 After the telephone conference call we had on 9/17, I contacted the Roger 
 Kohn permit engineer with EPA about a possible meeting with his agency to 
 resolve and assist the issuance of the air permits for stations 3 and 4.  His 
 message back to me was a reiteration of the last request I made to him, that 
 he could see no way that Transwestern would be able to help the EPA in this 
 matter.  We discussed the possibility of Transwestern contacting his 
 supervisor, Gerardo Rios, about a potential meeting and he indicated that we 
 could choose this avenue if we desired. 
 
 Gerardo's telephone number is 415-744-1259.
