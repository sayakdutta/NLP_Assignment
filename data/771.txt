 have worked with in the past.
 
 He has built numerous custom homes in the Kerrville\Fredericksburg area that
 are very high quality.  He has excellent long time crews using local German
 craftsmen. They do outstanding trim work and framing.  Most of his houses
 are Texas style with solid rock walls, standing seam roofs, antique wood
 flooring, cabinets, etc.
 
 Let me know if you are interested.
