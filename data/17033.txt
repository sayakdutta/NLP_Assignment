 It's rough, but Paul and I concluded that, since I'll be in Houston, best 
 that I send out whatever I have by COB today.  I will be working on this more 
 on the plane on my way to Houston.  Now we have Sandi's, Paul's and this, all 
 of which I think are headed in the same direction and complement one 
 another.  We'll need to meld them.  Please look at all 3 at the same time.  
 Might be useful to begin an email conversation now with folks comments.  I'm 
 reachable and will be back in the office on Thursday.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
