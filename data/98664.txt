 ENA has been asked to deliver a legal opinion which will be dated December 7, 
 2000 in connection with its delivery of a ISDA Master Agreement.  Are you 
 aware of any litigation or proceeding, threatened or ongoing, which would 
 question the validity of the ISDA Master Agreement.  I ask this in connection 
 with my opinion due diligence.
