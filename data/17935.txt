 get a free weekend out of it (in addition to getting the money back).

 Because Jeff told us that he wasn't going to play, I assumed we all weren't 
 going to play. So I went ahead and made plans for us to go see my mom (and 
 my uncle and his family) this weekend in San Diego... Sorry about that. I 
 leave at 12:30 on Friday, and Cameron comes down at 6:30.
 
 P.S. I'd think about staying if the gig paid for that spurious $740.00 bill 
 from Squaw.
