 
 your number is in my phone...can you call me?
 
 
 
     
 
 I am sorry to keep bothering you, but what exactly does that mean.  I'm sure
 you are busy, so this will be my last message.  Is there no availability at
 the lodge, or are you unavailable.  You don't need to respond.  But at some
 point before noon tomorrow, I will need to know your flight info.  
 
 Keep it Real,
 Laurel
 
 
     
 
 no availability...
 
 
     
 
 You still didn't answer my question.
 
 
     
 
 Oouch!  
 
 
     
 
 
 
 
     
 
 I continue to write to you, but you don't write back.  That's nice.
 Anyways, I heard that Skamania lodge is a cool place to stay.  It is in
 Washington, but just across the river from Hood River.  I don't know
 what
 you think about that.  If you want, I can contact them.  I'll wait to
 hear
 from you....
