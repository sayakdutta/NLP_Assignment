 
 Hi:
 Hope you had a nice weekend.  Sorry I missed you all in Washington.  Rick's 
 asked me to attend the meeting at the Woodlands tomorrow.  Do we have a list 
 of attendants/agenda?  No big deal, but would help me in preparing for the 
 meeting.  I'm assuming that the meeting takes place tomorrow only?  I'm 
 staying through Wednesday, nonetheless, and have booked a room at the 
 Lancaster.  But if the meeting's going to continue through Wed, I was 
 wondering if I should be staying at the Woodlands.  Thanks (as always) for 
 you help.
 
 Signed,
 Clueless
