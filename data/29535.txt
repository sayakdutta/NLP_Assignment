 
 Danny, I'm resending as I had the same problem Cindy did.  I'll give you a 
 call later today after I've talked to Harris to discuss the various Gallup 
 scenarios to make sure you and I are on the same page.   The plan that makes 
 the most sense in my mind is to ram the 10,000/d  project through asap, with 
 no firm contracts to preserve our options on a NEWCO structure.  We'll 
 simultaneously implement a new approach on San Juan fuel transport if 
 possible and then throw the big expansion into the hopper at FERC in January 
 as Stan suggested.  I hope that timetable is doable--it all depends on 
 planning/ops deciding what they want to build and then clearing our financial 
 hurdles.   DF

 I agree with Danny's email that the key timetable issue for the incremental
 10,000/day appears to be lead time on fabrication and delivery of the
 15,000hp motor.  It was my understanding that the long lead time items were
 going to be ordered shortly (if they haven't been already) and that we'd
 take the financial risk.  If that is our approach, the regulatory approvals
 won't be the critical path item they usually are.  I've reviewed the FERC
 application and we should be able to file it shortly, perhaps with a
 request for temporary emergency certification if we decide that would
 expedite things.  Additionally, we are looking at transactions that would
 allow us to avoid physically hauling the 20,000/day of fuel down the San
 Juan lateral.  If we could unload our fuel requirement from the San Juan,
 the additional horsepower at Gallup might provide some additional
 flexibility or additional capacity.   I'll talk to Steve today to make sure
 we are doing everything possible to expedite these efforts.  DF

 I believe that Phil Lowry is looking at ways to get some additional
 capacity out of the system as well.  We want to expedite these efforts
 too..  I would like to see an application filed filed by January 31st to
 get 30 to 50 MMCF/D.
 
 Steve Harris and Phil Lowry should have the lead to get this done.  I am
 willing to construct at risk but want to see the financials as well.
