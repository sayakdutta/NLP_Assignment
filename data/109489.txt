 Jeff,
 
 Have we explored the possibility of a broadband partnership with the Disney 
 Corporation? I watched an interview the other night with Michael Eisner, and 
 he said several times during the interview that Broadband held the future for 
 delivery of Disney's entertainment products, but Disney is still waiting for 
 the broadband infrastructure and bandwidth to be developed.
