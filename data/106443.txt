 
 Derek:  Gail Shanley (Goldman Sachs & Co. in N.Y.) sent me Enron Credit Inc. 
 documents (with Goldman Sachs & Co.).   Enron Credit Limited will be dealing 
 with Goldman Sachs International in London.  I'll try to find out who the 
 London lawyer is and have the docs sent to Denis O'Connell who is the lawyer 
 for Enron Credit Limited.
