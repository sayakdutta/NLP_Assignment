 Your supervisor information provided by the A/A program for loading into the 
 PEP system was either missing, or invalid.  Please send me the correct 
 information, being careful to list the supervisor's complete name.  In 
 general, we use the supervisor of record on 5/1/00 for mid-year reviews, but 
 let me know if we need to make an exception, particularly if your supervisor 
 of that date is no longer an Enron employee.  
 
 Thank you.
