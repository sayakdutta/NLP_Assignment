 and Jubran (and you, for that matter) be included in any distribution that 
 includes ENA West.  Consider it done.  Unless others have any problems, I 
 suggest that going forward any emails, materials, phone conversations, etc. 
 that include ENA also include EES.  I don't think that we have any legal 
 issues associated with including both ENA and EES, but if I'm missing 
 something, please let me know.  Thoughts?

 Neil Bresnan and Jubran Whalan are in Dennis Benevides' group and are 
 assigned to California.  Neil contacted me and asked that he and Jubran be 
 brought into all the loops on how we are handling wholesale issues in 
 California.  They are somewhat disturbed that they are not getting the same 
 access to information and influence as ENA West Desk.  I know I have 
 underestimated their need for independent involvement, but can we immediately 
 start involving them in everything  - through e-mails, conference calls, 
 request for comments, etc.
 
 Jeff - could you call me with any particular strategy you think we should 
 follow here - meetings or whatever.  Thanks.
