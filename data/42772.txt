 Jeff,
 The RFP is due to NDR this afternoon/tomorrow morning.  If you could please provide me with the appropriate language to include by this afternoon, I would greatly appreciate it.  Also, should I enclose a copy of our master agreement and/or a resale agreement with the RFP?  Please advise.
 If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call Sylvia (36211) or I.
 Thanks in advance for all your help.

 	I have looked at the material and it seems backwards to me.  I think that instead of ENA being assigned the contract between NDR and MichCon that MichCon should be assigned the supply contract between NDR and ENA.  In other words, ENA should not step into the shoes of NDR, MichCon should.
 
 	Also, I have attached a copy of our sample Master Agreement.
 
 Thanks,

 Please review.  Also, if you could send an electronic copy of our master enfolio agreement, I would greatly appreciate it.
 Thanks.
