 
 FYI - we may need to revise.  Does this ISDA have our new changes?

 Rod-
 
 This is my last e-mail from Julian on the Central Puerto power swap.  He 
 should be back in Argentina this week from being on vacation.  
 
 You will need to follow up with him and Sara concerning the ISDA,  The main 
 credit issue was the BB MAC trigger that does not cover when a counterparty 
 is no longer rated by S&P.  As of July 1999, C. Puerto is no longer being 
 rated by S&P and was last rated BB-.
 
 The ISDA does have the CSA with a 1MM threshold, but this is an older ISDA 
 so, you may want to review.
 
 Regards,
 
 Pat

 Pat,
 
 I am looking at a financial swap with C. Puerto for 50/70 MW for maybe 2/3 
 years.
 Does this volume & term trigger any posting of LC from Puerto's behalf?
 
 Thanks, Julian
