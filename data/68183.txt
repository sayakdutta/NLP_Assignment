You need to get us to start buying it here and shipping to you man - Sam's has it for less than $4 a loaf.  I think Ashley said it is close to $6 in San Diego.  We still need to get you some soup don't we?

 We went to a place called Carpenteria. It was on the beach near Santa
 Barbara. We totally roughed it,tents and all. How is your bread situation ?
 Do you need a new shipment?

 We went to the game.  unfortunately, I picked up a cold from being out in
 the rain all night Friday and Saturday, but we had a blast.  A win cures
 everything.
 
 We are now ranked #20, we were previously unranked.  Where did you guys go
 camping?  Do you rough it all the way?  My idea of camping is watching TV
 outdoors.

    I did not. We were out of town camping. I did see the score and was
    happy to
    see that they
    roughed up Florida. What is their rank? Were you at the game?
 
    Everything is going good. Say hi to Ash and J-Bug.
