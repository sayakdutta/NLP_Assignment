 Marcelo and John,
 
 As we have discussed before, we need to document that the price we are using 
 for the LM6000's for Electrobolt  is "fair market value".     There are 
 several third party sales at Enron that may be applicable to help with this 
 exercise.    Kay Mann has offered to help with this,  but  to compare 
 Electrobolt's LM6000's to the other sales, we need the equipment list for the 
 LM6000's---i.e. what attachments are included with these LM 6000's.    
 
 Kay, what do you need to help with this.   Is it a full equipment list, or 
 some other equipment summary.    Could you please describe.   I believe 
 Marcelo or John Ayres are the most likely to be able to provide the 
 information, but am not quite sure what to ask for.      Thanks.    
 
 Mary
