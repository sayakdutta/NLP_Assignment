 
 i got the message.  i didn't think you guys would make it.  i am going to new 
 orleans to meet my brother and just go out.  we are just going to party in 
 the french quarter.  my parents own a place down there so we have a free 
 place to stay.  one of my friends is also having an engagement party that 
 saturday that i have to go to.  if you guys want to party in new orleans give 
 me a call b/c we will be down there from that fri through that monday.  i 
 haven't gone out in the quarter in such a long time.  talk to you soon.
