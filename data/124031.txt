 Deal Entry needs your user testing today.  The Production freeze starts tomorrow so we have to move this today if it is ok or it cannot be moved for another 2 weeks.
 Kroum made some changes so that the long deals done in Canada will not crash the system.  You should not see a change at all.  They had over 2000 transactions that replication could not keep up with, but that has been fixed.
 I will be calling you to make sure you are able to test.  I appreciate all your help.
 Thank you!
