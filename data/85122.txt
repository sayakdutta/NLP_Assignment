 
 Lori,  Thanks for the diskettes.  The one disk did have the final version of 
 the Agreements.  The other disk had earlier versions of the docs.   I will 
 use the final versions to develop the amended and restated agreements.  
 Should have drafts for BR's review later this week.  Do you want these 
 diskettes returned?  
 
 I talked to Shonnie about any amendments to the LLC and Capacity Allocation 
 Agreements, and she wasn't aware of any.  I don't think those 2 agreements 
 were revised unless you have other information.  Let me know.
 
 Thanks, 
 Gerald

 I checked my computer and couldn't find any evidence of the files on my hard
 drive; however, I did find two diskettes that, at first glance, appear to
 contain the same documents, some of which look like they might be the
 finals.  If you'll email your street address back to my assistant, April

 courier.  You can take a look at them and see if in fact they are identical
 and have the information you need on them.  If you find them to be exactly
 alike, just send one back to me for safekeeping here.
 
 Thanks!
 Lori
