 
 i was just in town over labor day weekend.  my hoodlum friends and i didn't 
 get into too much trouble.  so do you have to learn new "internet terms"  in 
 your new job.  you need do be able to talk the talk with those it folks.    
 well the job sounds good if you are going to retire in one year.  i think i 
 am going to work until i am 40 then i am moving to florida to live on the 
 beach.  so how is denver?  i miss the good weather.  have you guys been 
 partying?  did you have any good gossip for me.  you need to fill me in b/c i 
 am way out of the loop.  good luck with your new job and email me back when 
 you get a chance.
