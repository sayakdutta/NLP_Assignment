 
 Is an RCR still necessary since Sue said Ron is doing this for Richard?  Tell 
 me when you see me tomorrow.
 
 





  
 I agree that someone should file. Curious if we can send in our message 
 through EPSA or WPTF?
 
 Mary's last point about the non-ISO and PX markets is a key point.  We need 
 to keep any FERC action contained to those markets.
 
 Mary - pls submit an RCR.

 Due to the risk of wholesale market participants becoming bankrupt and 
 therefore unable to flow refunds through to customers, the City of San Diego 
 has asked FERC to direct sellers of wholesale power in the "California" 
 markets to sequester any amounts collected from sales that are in excess of 
 costs and to maintain those amounts, with interest, adequate to pay potential 
 refund obligations.  It also asks FERC to clarify that these amounts are 
 being retained by the sellers in trust to fulfill refund obligations.
 
 I think we should make the following arguments at FERC:
 
 In the In re Columbia Gas Systems Inc. case relied on by San Diego, FERC had 
 ordered, and Columbia had received, refunds from upstream pipelines, but had 
 not specified that Columbia was to hold those refunds in trust for its 
 customers.  To my knowledge, none of the refunds FERC has recently required 
 would be paid to EPMI, nor has FERC required EPMI to make any refunds, it has 
 merely conditioned its rates "subject to refund."  Accordingly, it is 
 inappropriate for EPMI to be required to sequester any of its profits.
 San Diego seeks to apply this requirement to every participant in the market, 
 although it has not proven that refunds would put EPMI on the verge of 
 insolvency.  It has simply said that "there is no assurance that the actual 
 wholesale sellers , , , are capable of paying the refunds that potentially 
 may be ordered."
 San Diego also alleges that the potential refund obligation is immense.  This 
 allegation is based on San Diego's allegation that the refund liability 
 calculated by FERC's March 9 order (of $69 million) is vastly understated.  
 This is suppostion, on supposition, not to mention a collateral attack on the 
 Commission March 9 order. 
 The pleading is in essence a request for cost-of service based rates given 
 that market participants would be deprived of any benefit of participating in 
 the market for years - "pending a final nonappealable order in these 
 proceedings."  Therefore, it is a collateral attack on FERC's December 15 
 order finding that it would not order cost based rates.
 This pleading also seeks refunds beyond what could be required pursuant to 
 FERC's December 15 order in that its would apply sequestering to sellers of 
 wholesale power "in the California markets" not just for sales in the ISO and 
 PX markets.
