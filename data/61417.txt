 
 Kori,
 
 John is out of the office today.  I will convey your message to him when he 
 phones.  If there are any changes, I will alert you.
 
 Have a great day and wonderful weekend.

 Sorry to hear you were "under the weather" yesterday.  I just wanted to 
 confirm that the 1000 lot trade you did with Mike Maggie should go to your 
 power book.  That is where it is being captured, if this is not correct, 
 please let me know.
 
 Kori.
