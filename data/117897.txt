 As you are all aware, the legal department has grown significantly over the 
 last several months.  While so far we have been able to find places for 
 everyone to sit, we have not added significantly to the available file 
 cabinet space on the floor.  In fact, a number of file cabinets are now in 
 locations where they will not be able to remain due to fire code requirements.
 
 Please review the files you currently have stored outside your own office 
 space and, after condensing, archiving and destroying as many as possible, 
 give an inventory of your current usage and needs to your group leader.  Once 
 we have an accurate picture of our needs, we can come up with a plan to 
 allocate the available file cabinet space.  Most if not all of us will have 
 to make significant sacrifices and modify our filing practices so that we 
 each reduce our file space usage to our fair share.
