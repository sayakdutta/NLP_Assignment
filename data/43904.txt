 
 Panda has already scheduled other meetings around ours so they can't move our time.  The will likely be in our office around 1:30pm Tues and we should be done around 3:30 -4pm if you finish with Stan early and would like to join us.
 
 thanks

 I can make it by 8.
 
  
     
 If I can set it up, are you available for breakfast with Panda on Wed morning?  How early?
