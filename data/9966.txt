 Version 1.5 of the GISB standards has been posted to the GISB Web site.  The next step in the process is for the GISB office to send the standards to the FERC.  The implementation date of the standards is set by the FERC.  You'll be notified as this process progresses.
 
 Electronic copies of the version 1.5 standards books can be downloaded directly from GISB's Web site (www.gisb.org/frameset.htm).  To locate the books, click on 'STANDARDS' in the menu on the left-hand side of the screen.  The version 1.5 standards books will be located at the top of the page.  You'll need the ETS logon ID and password.  Please call Alma Carrillo (-36503) if you need the ID and password.  Please remember that this is an ETS' ID and password -- it is for the use of ETS' employees.  (NOTE:  The posting for the EDM standards book shows a date of November 15, 1999.  This is only a typo on the Web page.  The actual book is dated June 18, 2001.)
 
 Paper copies of the version 1.5 standards will be available.  Early next week Alma Carrillo will distribute a form for requesting paper copies.  We will coordinate this effort for the Houston people.  I'll let you know the coordinator for Omaha.  You can also print the standards directly from the GISB Web site.  
 
 Please let me know if you need help obtaining the standards books or have further questions.
 
 Thanks,
 Theresa
