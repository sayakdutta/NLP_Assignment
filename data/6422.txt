 
 walls, toomer, and garner for taylor?  that is the best i can do and that is 
 the best deal you will get for taylor all year regardless of how he does.
 
 now i would be willing to talk freeman if you want to thro in either watters, 
 anderson or george?
 
 I need to know fairly quickly
 
 
 
 

    
 
 I am happy with my Tight End and Garner has proven less valuable than
 Watters thus far this season.

 Eric,
 
 Let me know if I have Anderson or not.  If I have Morton I want to pick him
 up and drop my other kicker.  If I don't have Morton do the same thing
 except pick Hanson up instead of Anderson
