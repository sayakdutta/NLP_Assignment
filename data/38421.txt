 
 Would it be okay if we went ahead and rolled the socal and baja transport in 
 sitara?  I would like to input the Socal transport through October 2001, San 
 Juan to PG&E Topock and Mojave Topock (ask Janie for the allocation in 
 April).  The Baja transport is through March 2002.  80000/d to Citygate and 
 20,000 to KRS off-system.
 
 This will really help me monitor my physical index exposure on the curve.  
 Let's get together and discuss tomorrow.
 
 Thanks,
 Mike
