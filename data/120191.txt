 I am sure I do not understand the basis for the information but two reports seem to contradict.  
 
 The PJM 180 day forecast predicts 4000MW offline today.

 The PJM outage report predicts 1908 MW offline.

 Do we have a feel for which of these is more reliable?    
 Li, Jiewen; Symms, Mark
 Thanks,
 David Ingram
