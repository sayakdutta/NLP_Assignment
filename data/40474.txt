 On 3/14/01, FERC granted EPMI and Duke's request for rehearing of Arizona 
 Public Service interconnection procedures:
 
 APS is required to specify a time in the interconnection process after which 
 a generator is no longer subject to additional studies (we pointed out the 
 VEPCO limitation that no further studies are required after the 
 Interconnection Agreement is signed or filed unsigned at FERC).
 APS is required to include in its procedures the study criteria (for example, 
 Form 715) that it uses for system impact studies.
 
 These changes are helpful as FERC continues to build on previous orders in 
 other utilities' interconnection procedure dockets.
