 
 I'm getting ready to take Michael to the pediatrician, so it depends on how 
 long that takes.
 
 I'll find the instructions and email them to you.
 
 If I'm not on there but Kent is, could you let him know I really need to talk 
 to hiim?
 
 Thanks

 Good Morning!  I would rather that we not change the time of the GE call 
 since I have Lisa, Dean and Ben sort of primed for it.  Will Scott and Rose 
 be joining you?  I don't think it will take more than 20 minutes.  Would you 
 please email me the dial in instructions and let me know whether you will be 
 on the call?
