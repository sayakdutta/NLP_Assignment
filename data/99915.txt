 Attached is the preliminary CA monthly report for December for your review.  Please verify the following:
 
 TK - The rates under Item 1 (especially those highlighted in pink, which I updated manually by reviewing invoices/transactional reports)
 Darrell - The operational capacity and footnotes under Item 3
 Terry - The scheduled and/or nominated volumes under Item 1 and 3 (I've done some cross-validations checks but another pair of eyes will help)
 Jeanette - Overall data and format for accuracy
 
 Please provide any comments to me no later than COB Monday, 1/21/02, for updates.  Once finalized, I will email to the full distribution list.
