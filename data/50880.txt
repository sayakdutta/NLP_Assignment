 Dear Vince,
 
 I very much enjoyed speaking with you at lunch, if only briefly, at the
 =01&Finance Festival.=018  We
 have more common interests than I realized at first, as I am interested
 not only in weather
 derivatives, but also in the financial econometrics of risk management,
 broadly defined.  And
 moreover, business interests have recently led me to focus on electronic
 
 trading and brokerage
 issues.  A quick check of my web page will give you a good idea of the
 range of my interests; see
 http://www.stern.nyu.edu/~fdiebold.
 
 The upshot:  It seems to me that we would both benefit from a more
 extensive conversation.  I
 would be happy to visit you in Houston to learn more about your
 operations, and to tell you more
 about mine.  Please do let me know if you are interested.
 
 Best regards,
 
 Frank Diebold
