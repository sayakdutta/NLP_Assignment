 FYI ... I received a Message Delivery Failure on your "enron.com" domain, so
 I decided to try to forward the message to you again.
 
 


  
 I noticed a great job opportunity at Enron in the Houston Chronicle
 yesterday that appears to be a perfect fit for my experience.  My resume
 with the appropriate "Job #107224-Chron" in the header section is attached
 for your review.  I really look forward to receiving your telephone call.
 
 Thank you for your time and consideration!
 
 Sincerely,
 Marvin Avery
