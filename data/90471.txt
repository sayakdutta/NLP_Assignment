 Kevin,
 
 We have purchased the Flow Impact Study Tool (FIST) from NERC.
 
 The FIST electronic agreement needs to be executed by an officer of the company. Leslie Hansen has looked at this agreement and reached amended terms with NERC. She should have sent you an e-mail stating her approval that you can go ahead and send in the electronic agreement.
 
 The agreement is at  http://nws.nerc.com/fist/fistAgreement.asp
 
 If you have any questions, let me or Lloyd know.
