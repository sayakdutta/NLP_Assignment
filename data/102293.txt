 
 Donna Fulton is planning on attending the technical conference in the 
 Amoco/Burlington complaint proceeding on El Paso's allocation procedures.  
 She has asked that we let her know, if possible, what particular issues we 
 are interested in, as this will help her prepare for the conference.  Please 
 let me know if you have any comments in this regard.
 
 One caveat:  the technical conference is for "interested parties" only, and 
 since TW is not an intervenor Donna is subject to being kicked out of the 
 conf. if El Paso does not want TW represented there.  ENA will probably be 
 sending a representative so at the very least we can probably get some 
 intelligence from them.
