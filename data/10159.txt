 
 Nancy, can we meet today at 1:30 to go over my budget?  Please let me know
 if that works for you.  Thanks. Lynn
 
 
 
 


   
  
 
 
 Due to the June 1 changes in Shelley's organization, I'll need your
 timekeepers to give me your new payroll distribution percentages.  I'm
 preparing a new "budget" for Shelley, and would appreciate this
 information by the end of this week if possible.
 
 Sheila, I'm sorry I didn't respond to your call last week.  I was on
 vacation, and forgot to change my phone greeting.
 Call me if you need anything.
 
 Thanks,
 Nancy (x36311)
