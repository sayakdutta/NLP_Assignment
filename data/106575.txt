 Here are the updated changes per our phone call and fax received at approx. 
 1pm.
 
 Please check page 5 of your fax. The top of the fax was cut off, and I want 
 to ensure that
 the language should read, ", other than Section 6(b) of the general....".
 
 Please let me know of any other changes/modifications, etc.
 
 David
