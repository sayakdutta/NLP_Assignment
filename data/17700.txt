 circumstances, it's a win-win, and still leaves us with the swaption to 
 exercise at a later date.  Hope all is well. When I call, you're always in a 
 meeting.  I will be on the leadership call tomorrow.  Hope you're well.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Given the status of Phase I of DWR possibly being extended to the end of 
 April, we will not be circulating a DASH at this time for the five-year DWR 
 swaption.  Will advise at a later date of any developments.
 
 Thanks all for your help for now.
 
 Regards,
 Tracy
