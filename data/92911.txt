 
 Lynn,
 
 I spoke with Laura Luce on Friday, and she asked me to coordinate with you to 
 arrange a visit to the Chicago office.  We tentatively discussed scheduling 
 my visit for Friday January 26 to Monday Jan 29.  Please let me know if these 
 dates are still convenient and who I need to contact to make all the 
 necessary arrangements.
 
 Thank you for your help,
 Robin
