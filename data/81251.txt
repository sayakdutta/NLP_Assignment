 
 Mark, 
 
 Do you remember this agreement?  I think I told you to pass it along to the new lawyer when he came and I was wondering if this was done, and if I should follow up with him?  
 
 They certainly are persistent in getting us to sign this.
 
 Please direct me as to what I should be doing 
 
 
 Regards,
 
 Jon
 
 
 PS. When you comin' back?
