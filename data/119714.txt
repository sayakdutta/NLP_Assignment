 As we discussed, we would like you to consider adding the OXY point for Elk
 Hills deliveries into SOCAL at the Gosford intertie to the "NGI Socal/PG&E
 KRS" physical point. If you look on SOCAL's System Operations report our
 deliveries are listed as "Elk Hills - Gosford Intertie". Our flows on this
 pipeline typically range from 80MM to 165MM/day.
 
 Our gas from  this point interconnects with the PG&E Kern River station gas
 that then is delivered through Wheeler Ridge into SOCAL.
 
 Separately we would also be very interested in an SOCAL In state Production
 point on Enron OnLine.
