 
 Peggy, is the EOL bridge functionality working for you in Calgary?  Jeff 
 Gossett was in a meeting with me on Monday this week discussing systems 
 issues.  Beth Perlman mentioned that the EOL bridging had been completed, but 
 Jeff spoke up and said that it was not working correctly.  You or someone on 
 your team may want to call Jeff to understand the issues that he was having 
 to be certain that you are happy with the functionality that you now have in 
 Calgary.  Thanks.

 Please update the following items for Project Doorstep:
 
 Observation:  Term transactions executed via EOL do not automatically bridge 
 into the capture systems thus increasing the amount of transactions manually 
 captured.
 
 Status: The bridge from EOL to Sitara for term transactions was placed into 
 production on September 21st.  This item is now completed.
 
 For your information, we are planning to complete our Enpower testing today 
 and are working with Houston to go into production tomorrow.  I will let you 
 know once this is done.
 
 Let me know if you have any questions.
 Peggy
