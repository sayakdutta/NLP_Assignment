 
 Herman, this is the document I called you about.  AE is out-of-pocket, and 
 has some questions about this agreement, so she asked me to forward the doc.  
 This is a doc for a 40 yr ground lease for a power plant.  It is my 
 understanding that the counterparty is not interested in an option 
 arrangement.

 Attached is a revised draft of the lease agreement both as a clean copy and 
 red line comparison to the draft that you sent.  I would be glad to explain 
 the reasons behind the changes included.  The changes in the insurance 
 section are taken from the input of our insurance department.
 To answer your other question Andrew Balog at Greenberg is not a relative but 
 we are both Hungarian.  I don't run across many with that name especially 
 outside of the northeast and midwest.
