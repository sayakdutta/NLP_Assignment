 Thanks, Kim. 
 
  

  
 Dear Jorge, 
 
 Per our conversation on this past Monday, here is the letter we talked about.  We have an original that will be placed in the mail today.  Please feel free to give me a call if you have any questions.  We look forward to hearing from you soon.  
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Kim.
