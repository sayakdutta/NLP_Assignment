 
 Carol:  I've been meeting with Jarrod about confirm templates.  Prior to the 
 departures of Shari, Lynda, et al, there was a move afoot to create an annex 
 of weather definitions which could be incorporated by reference into the 
 confirms (or added to the Schedule), either of which approaches would shorten 
 the confirms considerably.  Jarrod advises that the EOL T&C's for the 
 varioius weather products contain the basic information which can be drafted 
 in the annex.  Jarrod will send us the EOL T&C's.  I think it's a great idea. 
 
 Jarrod will also send the existing  weather templates (which may be slightly 
 different from those Shari gave us earlier).  We should verify that the 
 weather rep appears in the weather option templates (since we have agreed to 
 remove that rep from the Schedule).  Also, shouldn't we verify that all 
 weather trades are executed under NY law (they probably are anyway) since we 
 now have the opinion from the NY Office of General Counsel?
