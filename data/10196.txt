 
 Beverly, thank you so much for your help this weekend and your offer to come into the office.  Between you, Amy and Terry
 we got through the weekend without a glitch on our side (even though we had system problems).  Tracy, I understand all is
 OK at your house.  I am glad to hear.  Cynthia, I understand you had some damage.  Please let us know if we can help in any
 way.  Linda and Bert, were you guys OK?  Thanks. Lynn
 
 
 
    
 	   		
 
 
   
  
 Since most of Houston is underwater and the Weather services is anticipate more rain today, Tracy and I have decided that I  will be working the late shift tonight.  Tracy's street is flooded and she doesn't know if she can get out of the subdivision.  She and I will talk later to see if it is necessary for me to work Sunday night.
 
 Will keep you posted.  Amy, if you need any help, please call me.
 
 Thanks,
 Beverly
