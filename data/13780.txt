 
 Kerry,
 
 We drove by your house, which looked like it took on some water.  I hope all is ok, and that you didn't have too  much damage.  Bellaire was hit pretty hard.
 
 On another note, if you are able to gather any more info on this Midwest Generation issue, would you please call Jeff Hodge in our legal department?  Twanda can connect you.
 
 I'll be on vacation this week and will return the 18th.  
 
 Thanks.
 
 Michelle

 Jeff Hodges has told me that you are helping us out with trying to locate information re: the Midwest Generation Labor Dispute.  The following article appeared in the Chicago Tribune today:
 
 Under a settlement agreement signed with the National Labor Relations Board, Midwest Generation LLC, a wholesale power supplier to Commonwealth Edison Co., will begin negotiating as early as next week with the union representing 1,150 of its electrical workers, officials said. The move comes less than two weeks after the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers local authorized a strike. The sides have disagreed over when the current contract expires; under a separate agreement, Midwest Generation was released from its obligation to maintain the existing contract through June 2002, company officials said.
 
 Would there be any way to obtain details about this, or is it probably a confidential settlement?
 Thanks for the advice.
 
 Phil
