 Could you send the location of the file with the descriptions to Anne Koehler in Houston and cc Nella.
 
 Thanx for your help.

 Everything has been copied to the newco directory.  We have one master index with the file names and descriptions.  Let me know if you have questions.

 Everything from Ops, Trading, Marketing, and Development in Calgary, plus Mike's inputs from Toronto, has been consolidated into one master index.  The file is located at 
 
 	I:\NewCo\00_README.xls
 
 If you have additional items to add to your directories, or I have not yet received inputs from you, please update the master index.  There is one tab for each department.
 
 Thanks,
