 Chris,
 
  I am not seeing this deal coming through Unify for ENA (EES shows a 
 purchase, but we are not showing a sale).  Could you please check to make 
 sure that we agree and that it is in the system?  Please let me know if you 
 have any questions.  Thanks...

 If this is for a volume of about 10,000 Dth it is a pool-to-pool transfer 
 from ENA (we are transferring this gas from Power Gas Marketing's pool).  
 When ENA purchased CES's book of business they acquired local production 
 behind the citygate.  This is one of those deals.  I did this deal with Chris 
 Germany of ENA.  If you need more information please let me know.  Thanks!  md
