 
 Harlan - Dede is out this week - how about I take everybody out for lunch on 
 Tuesday and we can figure out what to do for speech.  In the meanwhile, I'm 
 going to give ISDA the charts we used at last ISDA meeting for distribution 
 and Dede is going to get copies of various US agreements to ISDA.
 
 Let me know of Tuesday works or if not other open day.
 
 Thanks
