 
 I think I'll just take off until you get back!
 
 
 
 



  
  
 I went to the doctor today for my checkup, and he said I 
 was doing good (a very fast healer).  However, he still 
 wants me to take it easy for a couple more weeks.  
 Therefore, he's released me to return to work on Monday, 
 April 30!  I'll be ready!!!!!!!
