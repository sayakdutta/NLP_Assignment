 
 Here are my comments to the draft response:
 
 4.  I'm a bit troubled by the first sentence, since I really don't know what 
 may have been on the drawing board earlier.  Maybe someone else can vouch for 
 this statement. Otherwise, I suggest deleting it.
 
 17.  The reference to NC Power utilizing the plant should be Applicant (third 
 sentence).
 
 18.  I would change the second sentence to begin "It is intended that the 
 plant will be designed, constructed and operated...."
