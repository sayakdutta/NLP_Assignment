 Specifying it is for infrastructure costs may cause heartache.  
 
 Don't worry, I'll do the legal work!

 Kay:  Based on my conversation with Marvin, I think he is looking for 
 something like this:
 
 EPMI would be guaranteed a monthly minimum fee as reimbursement for 
 infrastructure costs calculated as the amoritized capital costs over the 
 contract period.  The monthly minimum will be considered to be met provided 
 EPMI's 40% share exceeds the monthly amoritized cost calculation.  Otherwise 
 "The Cities" agree to pay the shortfall between the guaranteed minimum and 
 the profits acrued to EPMI during the particular month.
 
 Just thought I'd communicate it a little better after I thought about some 
 more.  Try it on for size, see what David thinks, ....
 
 Thanks,
 
 Reagan
