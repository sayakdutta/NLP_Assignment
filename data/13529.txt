 Dear Michelle:  I agree with you and Kriste.  I thought we put this issue to 
 bed several years ago.  Consultants and Contractors are to be reviewed, if at 
 all, by their respective employers.  If the Consultant and/or Contractor is 
 not an employee of a third party employer, then Enron has the right to 
 determine if they are meeting the terms and provisions of their contract.  
 However, this does not mean they are to be included in the PEP and PRC 
 process. 
 
 To include them opens too many doors with respect to the proper 
 classification of these individuals.  If we treat them like employees, we may 
 find that a court determines they should be employees and thus eligible for 
 all employee benefits, a la MicroSoft.  
 
 Thanks.  Sharon

 I agree with your recommendation Michelle that consultants and contractors 
 should not participate in the PRC or the PEP process.  If  you treat 
 consultants and contractors like "employees", they will soon become them in 
 the eyes of the law, along with all of the costs, bonuses, and benefits.

 I have copied this email to Sharon & Kriste, who are supporting the CALME 
 region.  My recommendation is to exclude contractors/consultants because 
 their inclusion would increase the risk that they would be deemed to be 
 employees, and that a court could determine that they are owed employee 
 compensation and benefits (a la Microsoft).  This exposure could be high.  
 Depending on the other indicators of independent contractor status, rating 
 them along side our employees could be a factor to tilt the balance.
 
 Let me know if you have any questions.
 
 Michelle

 Hi Michelle, 
 
 Please see my note below regarding including JV employees and Consultants in 
 our PEP system and the PRC. Could you please give us more expert legal advice 
 (from my own : - )!!) in relation to this? We want to ensure that we cover 
 ourselves.
 
 Thanks, K2.

 David, 
 
 I've been forwarded a voicemail on Friday from David Haug where he has 
 requested that we include CALME's JV employees and Consultants who are at the 
 VP level. (He knows that they should not be pulled into the VP meeting).  
 Monica and I initially pushed back on this due to the requirement that only 
 AIP employees are involved in our mid year process, however, due to David's 
 instance I'm reverting to you for a decision. 
 
 Although I do not have a strong opinion on including the JV's - my concern is 
 primarily with the Consultants.
 
 Below are my concerns in accommodating this request:-
 
 - The PEP system has officially told employees that the feedback stage has 
 finished. Although the system is still open we are going to turn off the 
 system message requesting reviewers to access PEP to review employee.  In 
 this instance, there would need to be an effort within Janie's team to 
 communicate to all reviewers of the JV's that they are required to give 
 feedback.
 
 - The way PEP is set up, we would need to load the consultants as employees 
 in order to generate the 360 feedback functionality. Due to US law on how to 
 describe employees/non employees in a database, this comes with legality 
 issues and I want us to be aware of what we're doing regarding this.
 
 Call me to discuss or if you wish for me to forward the voicemail, 
 
 K2
