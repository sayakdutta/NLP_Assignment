 
 Just to be on the safe side, are you familiar with this and/or should I call 
 Rick if we have questions?  A second email to follow.  Thanks.  SS

 Nancy: I just spoke to Rick and he confirmed that EPCA is the company that 
 needs the brokerage account. I also just learned from Kishkill that we would 
 like to start trading as early as Friday, if possible. We would appreciate if 
 you could help us speed up the process. Please let me know if you need any 
 further information. Thanks.

 Please let me know which company needs to open a brokerage account in 
 connection with the CIESA transaction.  Once you tell me which company it 
 should be, we can start the corporate authorization process and I will 
 coordinate with Marie Heard of ENA concerning other information she'll need 
 in connection with opening the account.
 
 Please bear in mind that it will take some time (I'm not certain exactly how 
 long--I will find out) to get all of the proper authorizations and other 
 paper work into place, once you have decided on the company.
