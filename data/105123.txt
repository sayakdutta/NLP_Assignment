 trading (not a bank).  In transacting with a French corporate, should we 
 request articles and bylaws for capacity and ALSO a due authorization 
 opinion?  I think that this is correct.  However, if we are transacting with 
 an "S.A.", we should NOT request articles and bylaws but only the due 
 authorization opinion.  My notes on these items are confusing.  Could you 
 please respond in the morning?  Thanks.  Sara
 
 p.s.  We are currently operating under the "one Transaction rule" with French 
 non-bank entities in order to avoid the netting problem.
