 doing such a good job at driving this process.  My thoughts on your proposal 
 (and these are very preliminary):  1) politicians may not be willing to go as 
 high as 25% for fear of being accused of a "utility bailout"--maybe 10-15%?  
 though utility solvency may force their hands.  2) TURN will go ape-#%#$ if 
 we make the "roll off" retroactive to October.  3) I'm willing to allow 
 utilities to collect TRA undercollections, but feel that customers and 
 utilities (not me) need to figure out precisely what that number is.
 
 Look forward to getting closure tomorrow, though I'm very concerned that 
 we've lost Edison, given Bryson's public calls to return to 1950.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 I really appreciated your participation today...very substantive and
 constructive.  I particularly liked the idea of a migration "trigger",
 which I included in the outline.  I personally think that the big ticket
 items are rate level, rate freeze end and TRA allocation.  I wish we
 could start facing that dance.  I'd play with (a) 25% immediate increase
 in commodity price (explicit, rather than residual); (b) rate freeze end
 on October 2, 2000 (c) pre EOF TRA undercollections to utilities,
 everything after is allocated forward to procurement customers.
 Thoughts?
