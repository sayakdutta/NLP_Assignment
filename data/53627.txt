 Let me briefly introduce myself. My name is Harry Baumes and I head the
 Agriculture Services area at DRI-WEFA. I have been working with Peter McNabb
 regarding ENRON's interest in our agriculture and fertilizer capabilities.
 He has asked me to forward samples of some of our short-term oriented
 agriculture publications to you.
 
 Peter has forwarded material to you and your colleagues already. The
 materials attached are in PDF format. These products include:
 
 US Agriculture Executive Summary
 Corn Commodity Update
 Cotton Commodity Update
 Rice Commodity Update
 Soybean Commodity Update
 Wheat Commodity Update
 Fertilizer Market Assessment
 
 In addition I am also including a recent "Agriculture Commentary". This is a
 product that we release on an as needed basis. When there is a major USDA
 publication release or a major event that impacts agricultural markets, we
 typically release an assessment of the event or publication. For example, on
 March 30, the USDa released it Planting Perspective report, we provided our
 clients with an Commentary. The outbreak of Foot & Mouth Disease in the UK
 earlier this year was an event that led us to release a Commentary. The
 Commentary is DRI-WEFA's quick response newsworth items.
 
 Also, to help support clients. We make available to our clients, Planting
 and and Harvest Progress Reports. this information is available to
 individuals and/or organizations through USDA. The value DRI-WEFA provides
 is that we include graphics that enable a comparison of the current year's
 progress with the 10 year average and the PROGRESS high and low over the
 past 10 years. This detail is available at the national and for each
 reporting state.
 
 If you have any questions after reviewing the attached material, please feel
 free to contact either Peter or me.
 
 I look forward to the opportunity to work with you and your colleagues at
 ENRON.
 
 Have a  nice weekend.
