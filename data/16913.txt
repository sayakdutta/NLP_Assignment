 Statement by Jan Smutny-Jones,
 Executive Director of Independent Energy Providers,
 in Response to Today?s News Conference by Governor Davis
 
  "We applaud the Governor?s plan to increase electric generating capacity i=

 California.
 
 "Despite dramatic population growth, no major power plants
 have been built in California for ten years -- making it impossible to keep
 up with the demand for power and driving up the cost of electricity.
 
 "We are working with the Governor, legislators and regulators to help solve
 the problem =01. and we?ve made heroic efforts to keep our plants running a=
 t
 capacity to provide power during this crisis.
 
 "Rather than using tax money, we?re investing billions of private-sector
 dollars to buy, modernize and build new power plants to provide California
 with clean, reliable and affordable electricity.
 
     "Meanwhile, we urge California electricity users to do everything
 possible to conserve electricity at home and work."
