 things have changed.  
 
 Did you know that they now tell you to have  babies sleep on their backs?  
 That is totally different from when Paige was a baby.  It was hard to get 
 used to.

 That would be wonderful!  I was looking at those online this weekend.  I used 
 play pens all of the time for my children.
 
 Thanks very much.
 
  
     
 I have a pretty cool portable play pen you can have if you want.
