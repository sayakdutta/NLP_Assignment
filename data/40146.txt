 Ms. Hain - 
 
  Jim Steffes has asked that I help put together the ENA Government Affairs 
 Report.  The concept is to make the report a forward document as well as 
 reporting on items that have occurred.  The report is due to ENA management 
 the first week of each month.
 
  Please provide information on the current status and upcoming events for the 
 following projects by Friday, March 2, 2001.  The report currently indicates 
 the following:
 
 PROJECT	KEY ISSUES	STRATEGIES/COMMENTS/NEXT ACTIONS
 Antelope Valley	Interconnect ion Agreement.	Reviewing agreement for consistency with business 
 objectives and FERC requirements.
 		
 
  Please advise of any questions, comments or concerns.  I can be reached at 
 713-853-1711.
