 
 Chaim,
 
 I received a number of phone messages from you.
 The project is now in the hands of John and I shall
 be very happy to assist him when he is ready to move.
 He is looking at the licensing agreement right now.
 
 Till then, I have to wait for him to make  a decision.
 My role in this project is one of a facilitator, technical
 consultant.

 John:
 
 Thanks so much for getting back to me.  We remain keenly interested in doing
 the preliminary project for you so that you can know how MarketPoint works
 and how it might help you.  We are ready to go on the test process as soon
 as you and your people are ready.
 
 You heard from Dr. Chaim Braun, Altos Vice President, who called you at my
 request to inquire about your demonstration project.  I will mention to
 Chaim that you expressed your interest via email to me.  There is no need to
 phone him back until you are ready to go.  Chaim's email address is

 650.949.3541.  My personal phone number is 650.218.3069.
 
 I look forward to working together.

 Sorry so much time has passed since we last discussed your North American
 Gas Model.  I am however still interested in setting up a test process to
 familiarize some of our key people with the model and the database, etc.
 
 I am now reviewing the licensing agreement that you submitted in December
 and will be back in touch soon.  I need to discuss this further with the
 business segments, but I suspect that our interest will be focused more on
 the Long Term gas model.
 
 Another member of your firm had called last week, but I somehow misplaced
 his name and number.  I thought that an e-mail response would suffice for
 now.  My apologies.
 
 Regards,
 
 John Goodpasture
