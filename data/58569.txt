 Steven,
 
 Thank you for visiting with my class at Rice last night. They thoroughly
 enjoyed your talk -- after you left for the evening, we had a good
 discussion on topics that you had raised. My apologies again for the room
 mix up; somehow between myself, the university, and my secretary, the
 classroom assignment changed several times and the update did not get to
 you.
 
 Next year, if your schedule permits, perhaps you would consider a return
 engagement. I would certainly enjoy having you back.
 
 Regards,
 John
