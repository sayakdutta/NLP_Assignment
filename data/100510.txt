 I really have no other comments on the org chart or job descriptions.
 Thanks so much for your help!

 I just met with Steve Harris to review the Transwestern Commercial Group job 
 descriptions and proposed organization chart.  He agreed with the wording of 
 the job descriptions but suggested that the TW employees currently working in 
 NNG's Business Development and Marketing organization be shown on the 
 Transwestern organization chart in a dotted line reporting relationship to 
 him.  A footnote would identify them as 
 
 "Transwestern employees located in the NNG Business Development & Marketing 
 organization which serves as a resource to support the TW Commercial Group in 
 the areas of Risk Management, Pricing & Structuring, Business Development, 
 Market Analysis and Government Affairs"
 
 Steve also indicated that a TW employee will also be hired in the next few 
 days to fill a Regional Mgr Government Affairs job currently located in Mike 
 McGowen's group and that this job should also be placed in a dotted line 
 relationship reporting to him.  The existing footnote could be revised to 
 recognize this job as well. 
 
 After talking to Steve I feel that the above would be the best and least 
 confusing way to portray Transwestern employees in an on-line organization 
 chart.  In this regard I have again revised the Transwestern Commercial 
 organization chart and will deliver/fax it this afternoon to you both for 
 your review and comments.
