 
 I should be good for a place to say, but I certainly appreciate the offer.  
 I'm definitely still coming, though.  Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooo, tell me 
 when you're free, and we'll hang out.  You and Jess up for dinner?  Right 
 now, saturday night is the only night I have plans (basketball game).  I'll 
 be going out afterwards, though.  Just let me know.
 
 Later.
