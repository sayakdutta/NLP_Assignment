 
 Hi back!  and Happy New Year too!  To what do I owe this small pleasure?  I'm 
 fine in Texas, still hanging out with Phoebe and Chloe, working hard, etc.  
 Where are you living these days?  N.O.?  Atlanta?  Memphis?  Eleuthra?  St. 
 Petersburg?  Amelia Island Plantation?  I've simply lost track!  As for me, 
 well, I lead the simple life, own a little house in West University, own a 
 little car (I had to buy a new one recently - the 14-year old 380 SE started 
 scaring me a bit), you know, the usual.  Are you selling burgers up and down 
 the east coast?  Have you gone international?  In a new franchise business?  
 How's your family?  
  
 Got to get back to work!  This weekend I'm off to Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires 
 on business.  SARA
 
 
 
 

    
 
 
 Sara-  Happy New Year, stranger!   Hope all is well. Do you miss me?   SAM
