 
 Bryan,
 
 I am trying to set up a conference call 30 minutes with Andy Kalotay.
 I worked with Andy at Salomon; he is now running his consulting
 firm in NYC and would like to talk to us about marketing a credit
 product he helped to develop. The info is attached below.
 
 Shirley will call you in the morning.

 S&P Credit Indices 
 
                   S&P Credit Indices reflect daily movements in credit spread levels within two
                   sectors of the U.S. bond market. S&P Credit Indices are quoted in basis
                   points over the U.S. Treasury yield curve once daily. 
 
                   Credit spread movements within the investment grade spectrum are
                   represented in the S&P U.S. Industrial Investment Grade Credit Index while
                   movements within the speculative grade rating spectrum are captured in the
                   S&P U.S. Industrial Speculative Grade Credit Index. 
 
                   Each credit index represents the distribution of U.S. corporate issues across
                   different rating categories and subsectors. Re-balancing occurs regularly to
                   ensure that the indices are composed of relevant issues with sufficient
                   liquidity. Pricing information for the S&P Credit Indices' underlying securities
                   is derived from a number of sources. 
 
                   Option adjusted spreads (OAS) are used as a proxy for nominal credit
                   spreads in order to adjust for the presence of embedded options. Standard &
                   Poor's utilizes the proprietary option adjusted spread model developed by
                   Andrew Kalotay Associates, Inc.
