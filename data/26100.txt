 Hi All, 
 
 Are there any changes and/or additions to the staffing for the week of November 5, 2001?    
 
 The only addition I have listed is: 
 Tanya Smith beginning on 11/5/01 in Transport Rates. 
 
 Also, can you please tell me if any analysts/associates will be starting in your group and if any have left recently.   I need this information by Friday, November 2 at 12 noon.  
 
 Thanks, 
 Elizabeth
