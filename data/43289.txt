 I realize it's been a tough year and at the very least, these are trying times.  However, I ask that you consider a donation to support Texas Special Olympics.  On November 17, Enron bowlers will participate in the third annual bowl-a-thon to support this worthwhile organization.   
 
 Texas Special Olympics is a year-round sports training and competition program, patterned after the Olympic Games, which gives people with mental retardation the chance to strengthen their character, develop their physical skills, display their talents , and fulfill their human potential.  
 
 Special Olympics believes that through sports training and competition, people with mental retardation are benefited physically, mentally, socially, and spiritually; families are strengthened; and the community at large, both through participation and observation, is united with mentally retarded people in an environment of equality, respect, and acceptance.
 
 All money raised from this event will be used to provide financial support to assist the Special Olympics programs located in the Southern and Southeastern regions of Texas.
 
 Once again, please consider a donation.
 
 Thank you in advance for your generosity.
