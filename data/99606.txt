 To our customers and counterparts:
 
 As of Sunday, November 18 our OASIS and E-tag servers are running on PPT.
 The only business practices we are changing now, is that our OASIS
 transmission products are all based upon PPT.  Our scheduling system/e-tag
 server is also running on PPT.  However, we can and will continue to accept
 e-tags in any timezone, as long as the profile has a valid OASIS
 reservation.  We will also continue to check out with our counterparties in
 the time zone that we have historically used with each neighboring control
 area.  
 
 The cost?  $4.79 for a tall, skinny latte' and a plain bagel with light
 cream cheese for our programmer.
 
 If you have any questions, please give me a call at 208-388-2243.
 
 Thanks,
 Lisa
