 
 With respect to Online Trading, Mark wanted me to follow up with you re: 
 insurance/reinsurance company issues.
 
 Per our earlier conversations, I am saying "no" to online trading for all 
 insurance/reinsurance companies we do not have a master with.  The online 
 people have come back and said, hey wait a minute, you are already trading 
 with insurance companies without a master, i.e. Swiss Re.  They are wanting 
 to open up Swiss Re for online trading and any other insurance/reins. we are 
 currently trading with without a master in place.   Do you have a list of 
 those companies?   What are your feelings about that?  Can we trade online 
 with Swiss Re?  How about any other insurance companies you are currently 
 trading with without a master in place?  Or do you want me continue to say no?
 
 Thanks for your help!
