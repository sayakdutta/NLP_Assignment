 Jarrod it seems the reference to Sydney time for a Melborne weather 
 transaction could lead to an inconsistency this year. So if a time zone is to 
 be referenced it should be Melbourne.

 I agree this change could cause problems. During September 2000  daylight 
 saving will start early in Sydney during the Olympics. As a result there will 
 be a 1 hour time difference between Sydney and Melbourne.  The local time as 
 reported by the Bureau of Meteorology is Melbourne time. Hence if there is to 
 be a reference to a time zone it should time zone applicable to that 
 location. More generally we should put a definition of "LST "in documentation 
 as meaning the time at the relevant weather station. We could have a 
 circumstance of reference weather stations in difference time zones (eg 
 basket of cities).
 
 Heidi can you handle?

 Dear Heidi,
 
 1.
 I confirm that this is now a swap rather than a bought option.  
 
 2.
 To DAVID,
 ".... Please let me know if you think this document is acceptable........"
 
 Since Jared has replaced LST with Sydney time -
 
 should this be Melbourne time instead ?????

 The confirmation I have received below looks to be the deal we were talking 
 about when I was in Houston. Is this correct? At that stage, were we not 
 talking about there being a significant premium payable at the start of the 
 deal. It appears from the confirmation below that this is now a swap rather 
 than a bought option.  Can you please confirm that this therefore the same 
 deal. 
 
 Heidi

 Jarrod looks fine. For completeness I have noted one minor inconsistency in 
 (v) of the Fallback Data provisions that dates back to my first draft. Our 
 rounding of degrees celsuis is to one decimal point. Hence the reference to 
 whole numbers may not be apropriate in all cases. In practical terms it is so 
 immaterial I question the need to redo the confirmation. Anyway please put 
 together the the confirmation between between Enron Australia Finance Pty. 
 Ltd. and RMT. I have copied in Susan (Tax) and Heidi (Finance) to double 
 check they are fully aware of this arrangement.    
 
 
 
 
   
  
 David,
 
 I have attached a copy of the Confirmation that we sent to Aquila. They have 
 read it and returned a signed copy to me. Please let me know if you think 
 this document is acceptable. If it is I will go ahead and put together the 
 Transaction between RMT and Australia. If we need to make any changes, I will 
 send a revised copy to Aquila and then do the back to back transaction.
 
 Thank you,
