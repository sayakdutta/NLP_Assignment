 
 that's a great idea - thanks!
 
  
     
 Just FYI,
 In addition to the model that generates the prices for Palo Alto, I am archiving by date the prices we have sent Palo Alto on the O:\gas structuring\west\palo alto\price 06.2001\ directory.  Please let me know if you need anything else.....Thanks.
