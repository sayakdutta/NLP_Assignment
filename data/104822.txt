 I finally reached Tom Seligson and he will change the guaranty (below) to add 
 that ENA may assign the guaranty to any affiliate without the approval of the 
 guarantor.
 
 The remaining issue is whether to confirm on our omnibus or create a confirm 
 and adopt by reference the provisions of the Alcoa Inc./ENA master.  I have 
 left Ed Sacks a message.  Sara
 
 ps  I will be out of the office on Dec. 7,8
