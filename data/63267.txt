 My champion, hero, angel - I think I have made a major mistake!!!  I thought 
 I had tickets to Mark McGuire's team for May 12, but it is the Cinncinatti 
 Reds!!!  I am so sorry.  Is that going to be o.k.?  That's  what I get for 
 thinking I know anything about baseball.
 
 Look forward to hearing from you!!
 
 Love,
 
 Aunt Rosie
