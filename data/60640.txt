 John, as a follow up to Greg's call, I would like to provide equity value, in recognition of the huge effort on the EES issues plus key player on the team going forward, to the following people from EES:
 
                                 Options Equity          Total
 
         Rogers Herndon  $250K           $250K           $500K
 
         Don Black               $250K           $250K           $500K
 
         Jeff Richter            $100K           $100K           $200K
 
         Bernie Aucoin           $100K           $100K           $200K
 
         
 
 I assume that you have Tim and Kevin managed.
 
 Views?
 
 When are we going to get back together to finalize our discussions?
