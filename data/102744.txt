 
 I just finished having lunch with Tobin and he filled me in a bit about this 
 morning's meeting.  I don't know how you reacted, if you were upset, etc.  
 but I wanted to offer this up if you were struggling with the situation.  
 Whatever happens and whatever is said about your move don't ever lose sight 
 of the fact that in every aspect of this situation you conducted yourself in 
 the best and most open manner possible.  In no way can or should your conduct 
 be called into question.  Bearing that in mind any criticism that was 
 expressed within the meeting this morning was beyond inappropriate.  I am 
 sure it reflected much more poorly on the accuser than it did any of those 
 being criticized.  Furthermore, just keep focused on what an incredible 
 opportunity this move is going to be for you and all of the doors it will 
 inevitably open.  There isn't a doubt in my mind that you are bound for great 
 things, you just have to seize the opportunities that will lead to that when 
 they come along (which is exactly what you've done).  
 
 Keep your chin up and whatever you do don't doubt yourself or your actions.
