 Florencia:
 
 Please prepare a version of the resolutions I sent you before for signature.  
 Rafael Rangel will handle discussing the signatures with Perez Companc.
 
 Please contact me if you have further questions.
 
 Thank you.

 Dear Nancy,
  In connection with the mail I sent you on June 24, I need to know in what
 status is the deposit  of the ADRs in the account of EDIDE and the
 conversion into TGS shares.
  Best regards.
