 does conflict with Philippe's Thursday staff meeting I believe.  Maybe 
 Philippe will cancel that.  Let me know.  Thanks. --Sally

 In recognition of the one-year anniversary of Enron Net Works (ENW), Beth 
 Perlman is hosting a panel discussion at the April 12th session of her Lite 
 Bytz weekly lunchtime series.  The panel, which will be comprised of ENW 
 leaders, will be open forum and interactive.  We will invite the audience to 
 submit questions in advance and also have the opportunity to present 
 questions directly to you, at the session.  Beth indicated that this special 
 presentation would not be complete without you.  This should be a fun and 
 presenter-friendly session with virtually no preparation on your part 
 required.  I will contact your assistant to confirm your availability for 
 this special anniversary session of Lite Bytz, scheduled for April 12, 2001, 
 11:30-1:00.
