 
 We have scheduled a meeting with Antonio Felix and Marcelo on Tuesday, 
 November 30 at 9 am (Brazil time) in Sao Paulo.  The purpose of the meeting 
 will be to discuss the Tozzini memorandum of October 19, address unanswered 
 questions and identify issues for further research.  We are attempting to 
 identify specific financial products for immediate trading.   For those of 
 you in Houston who would like to participate, please let me know and we can 
 either revise the meeting time or conference you in  later in the meeting.  
 Please confirm your attendance as soon as possible.  Thanks.  Sara
