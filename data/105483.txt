 
 Janelle and Ed:
 
 I have received two voice mails from Con Ed inquiring about resolution of the 
 outstanding issues (I left each of you voice mails about these).  I'm not 
 revising any documents until I hear back from you.
 
 Janelle:  Please let me know if I need to take any further action.
 
 Thanks.
