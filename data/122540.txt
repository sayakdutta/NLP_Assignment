 
 did you get an updated tariff from Reg Affairs?  Let me know if you still need assistance.
 
 Thanks, Kim.

 Kim, Eric is borrowing Kevin Hyatt's TW Tariffs (small) binder.  He has asked me to try to get one for him.  Does someone supply those or do I just need to have it reproduced for him. 
 
 Thanks!
