 
 Thank you for the summary.  Where can we find a detailed summary of the gas 
 cost mechanism?  Are we confident that it is an average of all border points 
 into CA?  If the real time price is capped at the least efficient generator, 
 then what happens if this genertor can only buy Socal daily gas?  This 
 avergae CA gas price will lead to a tighter heat rate for the generators, 
 since the spread between Malin and Socal has reached $7.00 at times.
 
 Thank you,
