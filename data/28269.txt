 In order to reduce net O&M by $7.9MM on NNG and $3.8MM on TW, I propose the 
 following additions to overhead.  Per Rod, we will leave Gross O&M where it 
 is and increase the overhead allocations.  These dollars will be added to the 
 Capital Budget via an increased overhead rate.  Once finalized, I will 
 calculate the new overhead rate and send it to you so we can add these 
 dollars to the construction projects.
 
 Please review this proposal and let me know by Friday if we need to make 
 adjustments.  There is still a hole of $1.2MM on TW that we need to fill in 
 order to cover the Environmental Remediation/PCB costs without reducing them.
