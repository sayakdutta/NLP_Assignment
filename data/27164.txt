 Reliant/HLP  - $49
 TNMP  - $55
 COA   -  $40
 BEC  - $25
 
 
 For example,  if we schedule for one hour from BEC>COA,   the one-time charge for scheduling alone would be a flat  $65.      Also applicable would be the per mw  line losses and the wheeling fee of $.22  .    
 Please account for all such charges in the P&L report.
 
 Thanks,
