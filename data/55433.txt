 European Gas CERA Alert: Signposts to a High Demand Path for Natural Gas: The 
 Large Combustion Plant Directive and German Nuclear Phaseout
 
 Abstract 
 Two unrelated developments at the end of June both point in the direction of 
 a long-term high demand growth path for natural gas in Europe, consistent 
 with CERA's Blue Gold scenario. Both the approval of the Large Combustion 
 Plant Directive by EU environment ministers and the agreement on German 
 nuclear phaseout between the German government and industry could involve the 
 early removal of existing, low-cost generating plants from the European power 
 capital stock in the 2010-15 time period and their subsequent replacement by 
 natural gas-fired turbines.
