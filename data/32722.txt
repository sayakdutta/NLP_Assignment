 Are you going to send the pictures to me.  I ran an add on the tractor in 
 next weeks local bargains paper.  I priced it at $19,000.  Am loading 
 exchangers this a.m.  Gotts to Go!

 I believe Kodak just doesn't support the USB connection very well.  I tried 
 the
 other connection and it works great.  I pulled all the tractor pictures off 
 the
 camera with no problem.  I still have not seen a photo as clear as the very
 first one Chance pulled up of the family reunion though.
 
 All the tractor pictures are a little fuzzy.
