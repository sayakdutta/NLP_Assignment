 Enclosed is the January property tax billing for EOTT. Please forward this billing to the correct EPSC accounting employee so it can be billed to EOTT. The Enron Corp property tax RC is Co/ 011 / 100029 and should be credited to account # 52507300.
 
 Hopefully, this process meets with your approval.
