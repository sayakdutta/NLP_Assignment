 
 I would let her know that there is no definite timeline but we are closing a transaction next week.
 
 
     
 
 Any suggestions before I respond to this?
 
 
     
 
 Dave,
 
 Just wanted to clarify what kind of deadline your aiming for with this
 transport proposal.  The reason I am asking is I have taken this to the next
 level and we will probably need several days to run through our internal
 processes.  I know you are working with multiple parties so if you let me
 know how you would like to proceed then we can be working on a similar
 timeline. 
 
 Thanks,  Penny
 
 
     
 
 Sorry its taking me so long the guy I need to tlk to is out.  I'll get
 you the particulars tomorrow.

 Dave, you also mentioned space on TW - do you have any more information
 on
 this?
 
 Thanks, Penny
 
 
     
 
 Hey Penny,
 
 One more thought on the EPNG capacity valuation we've been discussing...
 physical gas in the San Juan is selling at a discount to index,
 therefore we are incorporating that into our valuation.  I thought you
 might want to consider that as well. 
 
 Thanks,
