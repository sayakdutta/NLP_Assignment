 Kay,
 
 I took a whack at redlining for CO#1 Fountain Valley Agreement.  You'll need
 to do some touch-ups, I believe.
 
 Let me know what other changes will be necessary.
 
 Thanks,
 
 
 Lee
 
 



  
 
 
 Gentlemen,
 
 Since we are moving the equipment from WestLB and into TurboPark, and since
 we are just about there with the breakout contracts, we need to process
 this as change order #1 to the Fountain Valley contract.  I also believe we
 need the site specific stuff for this project.

 All,
 
 Attachment contains latest revision reflecting order for two additional
 stacks, six power stabilizers and moving cost for the Fountain Valley
 Project.  Please review and let me know if additional changes are required
 or recommended.
