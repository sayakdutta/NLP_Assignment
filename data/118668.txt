 room - maybe you can coordinate with her.  It might also be nice if there is 
 a spare office or two that could be booked for the day (including the 
 morning) so we will have a place to work when not in the meetings.  The only 
 people I know of coming from out of town will be me and Ken Raisler, a lawyer 
 with Sullivan & Cromwell in New York.  We will have a better idea of any 
 audio-visual equipment we need as we get closer to the meeting date.

 Mark:  If there is anything you need in the way of facilities for this 
 meeting, please let me know.  I would be happy to assist.
