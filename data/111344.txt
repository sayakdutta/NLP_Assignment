 Sorry for not getting back to you sooner Carol.  Greg Wolfe was out on 
 paternal leave (he and his wife just had a baby...Annika) and therefore, I 
 was unable to get the continued green light from Greg.  Just spoke with Greg, 
 and he would still like for legal to pursue w/UK legal.
 
 Thanks,
 Tracy

 Tracy and/or Rod:
 Just curious about what happened to the proposed trade that we were going to 
 do with Kaiser.  Is there anything that the lawyers need to do at this point?
