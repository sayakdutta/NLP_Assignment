 Hi Jane:
 
 I'd planned to attend SoCal's meeting on Thursday, but it now appears I may have a conflict.  Do you plan on attending?  If so, could you gather up an additional set of anything they hand out for me?  Given the controversy around SoCal's "windows," it will be interesting to see how this works out.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
