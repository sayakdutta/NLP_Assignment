 
 well, i only got single prints...so i have to get copies or scan them or something...so it may take a bit..sorry.
 
 About the sock, ya I'm short on socks...so it would be great if you sent it, but if not, don't worry about it.
 
 
     
 
 For real, I have your sock.  I can keep it, if you don't want it, but it is
 too big for me.  What ever happened to those pictures you were going to send
 me?  Hmmmmm?
 
 
     
 
 you just want my address...2125 Sul Ross, Houston, TX, 77057....
 
 
     
 
 I washed your sock.  Would you like me to send it to you?  If so, I need
 an
 address.
 
 
     
 
 Oh yes, it was a good contest.  Gannon is quite the quarterback.  Did
 you?  I only watched the first half, though, because I was tired and
 went to bed.  Today, I'm watching our stock go to shit once again.  It's
 only a matter of time before we shut the doors.  I think the only thing
 that will keep us from going under is that the industry would get hurt
 too much.  Maybe the government will bail us out.  Anwyay, how's
 everything with you?
  
 
 
     
 
 Did you have some football-loving fun last night?
