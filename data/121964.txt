 Done.  Michelle sent it out this morning.  We will follow up with Mike to make sure he understands how the numbers were derived.

 Yes, I will have Kim Watson forward that info to you as well.
 
  
     
 
 
 Steve - at today's staff meeting, Danny McCarty asked to see the rate derivation of the Southern Trails pipeline with the conversion costs.
 
 Could I get a copy as well?  I am working with Steve Dowd on evaluating the Questar pipeline and this is a big part of it.
 
 Thanks.
