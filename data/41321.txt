 > The Ryder Scott freeware program on our Web site has won the Gold
 > Excalibur Award in the Interactive - Internet Web Site category from the
 > Houston chapter of the Public Relations Society of America.   Our entry
 > was titled, "Downloads for Data: A Give-and-Take Proposition."  The award
 > is the highest one bestowed by the PRSA chapter.  I entered the award
 > contest as a member of PRSA, which is the largest, most influential
 > association in the public relations profession.  The campaign was judged
 > by a panel of PR and marketing professionals.  For some idea of the
 > competition that we beat, Rives Carlberg, the leading advertising /PR
 > agency in Houston, won the silver and the multibillion-dollar Duke Energy
 > Corp. took the bronze.  Rives Carlberg is considered one of the top
 > PR/marketing firms in the United States.  Duke Energy has a entire
 > marketing/PR department.  Even though my name is on the award along with
 > the Ryder Scott name, various individuals in the company, including most
 > importantly, the creator of the freeware, James Latham, share in this
 > award.  Several RSC personnel also handle the password dissemination,
 > update our mailing list, refer clients and prospects to the downloads and
 > promote our Web site in general.  I owe a round of hearty thanks to these
 > people.  And the program just keeps on attracting new prospects to our
 > site.  As you know, in just the past week, we have received about sixty
 > new password requests.  The program just keeps on performing!
