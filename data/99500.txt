 ISAS Members and Interested Parties,
 
 OATI is currently not prepared to accommodate open ended testing during the
 WSCC test period of now through Tuesday, February 12, 2002. However, they
 have graciously agreed to provide us with two, four hour test periods as
 follows:
 
 Thursday, February 7, 2002, 0800-1200PPT
  
 Monday, February 11, 2002, 0800-1200PPT 
 
 Please make best efforts to kick the tires on E-Tag 1.7 during these time
 frames. We have attached another copy of the WSCC testing guidelines.
 
 Thanks and Good Luck!
