 But before I left I gave the tux to the front desk and gave them your name and room number. The guy was like, "Okay" and then walked to the back room without writting your name or anything down. So i told him again what name and room number. He said "no problem".
 
 Oh well. Sorry about the trouble and thanks for the invite. It was a great wedding.

 Geoff,
      Did you make it back ok?  The front desk had no idea where the tux
 was, in fact they didn't even have you checked out!!!  So we waited around
 until noon and had them go up to your room and check.  Anyway, they finally
 called and said they found it about 4pm and I went back and got it.  Thanks
 again for coming up, hope you had a good time.  LAter
