 
 Brian,
 
 Thanks. I shall ask Shirley to set up a conference call with Remy on Tuesday.
 You can come up to the 19th floor
 if you wish. I shall ask Martin Lin to join us well.
 
 Vince
 
  
     
 Good morning Vince!
 
 I'm sorry that I wasn't here when you sent the e-mail yesterday...  too many meetings in and out of the building.
 
 I had looked into this problem several months ago for a Canadian problem and I'll have to look through my notes to see what I was thinking at the time.
 
 I can be reached at (713) 654-4032.  (I guess you noticed that they removed me from peoplefinder.  We are oh so spooky around here.)
