 Hi,
 
 I just got a really cool software package that is helping me write and
 learn Kazakh.  I've attached my first letter.
 
 Lisa and I hope things are going well for you guys.
 
 We're filling out paperwork and getting things notarized almost every day.
 And we're getting more excited with each passing document.
 
 How's Alina doing?
 
 Please send us some pictures if you have any.
 
 Love,
 
 Kurt and Lisa
