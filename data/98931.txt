 
 As we discussed, Linda's divorce is in Judge Squires' court. The opposing 
 counsel is Susan Myres, who I think has recently moved to Don Fullenwiller's 
 firm. She presents a problem for two reasons. First,she is much,much more 
 aggressive than Linda's current atty. At the prelimanary hearing, she 
 objected to half of the question, which the judge sustained(he has asked to 
 withdraw and I say good riddance)  The bigger problem in my mind is that her 
 aggression has "empowered" Linda's husband. It is pretty pathetic from what 
 Linda tells me. He says things like"wait till I tell my lawyer about this, 
 she'll go straight to the judge" Linda needs someone that knows what they are 
 doing, is aggressive enough to handle Ms.Myres, and has some clout with the 
 Judge. Linda can pay,but has limited resources. Thanks for your help.
