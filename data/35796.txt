 The attached file is an update of the CES FOM June'00 request that was
 transmitted on 5/26/00.  The changes between this version and the original
 version are listed in the worksheet labelled "Comments".   The only changes
 versus Friday's transmittal are to AGL volumes delivered on Transco.
 
 The worksheet labelled 'Total Reqs.' and the one labelled 'Jun00 EPA Vols' 
 show
 volume requirements at the various citygates.  I have not adjusted our volume
 requirements to reflect supply from local production behind some LDCs per 
 Chris
 Germany's e-mail of 5/24/00.  However, I have inserted notes indicating where
 and what portion of the citygate volumes shown, will be supplied by local
 production per Chris's aforementioned e-mail.
 
 Also:  The volumes in the attached are requested pursuant to the 12/99 Energy
 Purchase Agreement between Enron and CES.  During June 2000 CES will be
 procuring additonal volumes from Enron under a separate deal, which should not
 be confused with this request.
