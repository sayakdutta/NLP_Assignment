 I have passed your comments along to our Credit Department and am waiting for a response.  I will touch base with them.  Hopefully we can wrap this up soon.

 Marie,
 
 Just wondering if you could give me an update regarding the status of our
 comments to the ISDA?  We have no place to get insistent, given the amount of
 time it took us to compile our remarks.  Still, I'm sure everyone is eager to
 get the issues resolved and the documents in place.
 
 Thanks.
 
 Adam Auten
