 
 Shirley,
 
 It will take a lot of effort to compile this list.
 
 Please, remind me about it.

 In an effort to identify intellectual capital for Enron's Knowledge 
 Management effort, we are establishing an inventory of documents (e.g. papers 
 published, speeches, magazine/journal subscriptions, professional 
 associations, etc.).  Please forward the types of documentation you have 
 which may be inventoried for other Enron employees' use.  If there are other 
 individuals like yourself with access to this type of information, please 
 forward their names to me.  I am available to discuss this effort at your 
 convenience.  My extension is 3 9698.
 I look forward to hearing from you.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Marie Hejka
