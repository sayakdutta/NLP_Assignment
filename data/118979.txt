 Hi Tana/Mark,
 
 I'm Sheri and will be the project manager for the Financial Trading Agreements database used by your group.  I understand that the current database is in Notes and needs enhancements. 
 
 I would like to meet with you both next week to discuss requirements.  I will be out of the office Monday 06/11/01 but am available to meet the rest of the week.  Which is a good day/time for us to meet.  
 
 Thanks,
 -Sheri
