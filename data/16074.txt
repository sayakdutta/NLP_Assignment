 I have reserved Mt. Bachelor conf room for 11:00 tomorrow.
 
 Also, I am forwarding the invite to Alan Comnes, Jonalan Page ,Angela Cadena 
 and Andrea Woodland.  They were a part of the discussion with Dave.
 
  
     
 Howzabout 11 AM?
 
 
 
 

 
 I can be available most of the day except 2:00-3:00.  Let me know if you have 
 a set meeting schedule.
 
  
     
 Hi Mike:
 Parquet found me to talk about the QF ideas that you guys are bouncing 
 around.  I'll be in Portland tomorrow.  You have some time to sit and discuss 
 a bit?
 
 Best,
 Jeff
