 A number of parts of the deal making process are flying around at the same 
 time and for the purpose of communicating to the team where legal sees the 
 matter at this point I offer the following:
 
 Apparently Greg Whalley has not yet signed the one month DASH.
 Credit has requested that legal put a MAC clause in the one month confirm 
 before the DASH is resubmitted to Whalley.
 West Desk traders (Greg Wolfe and Mike Etringer) report that Kaiser's power 
 guys in Spokane are saying that we can "sleeve"  the power to them through 
 Bonneville.  To legal, this means we sell power to BPA no strings attached  
 and assume nothing about who they resell it too.
 
 Obviously a clean one month sale to BPA is attractive.  But can it be 
 detached from the larger call spread transaction?  I don't know.  Given this 
 quandry, Greg Wolfe has advised me to hold off temporarily on preparing the 
 one off confirmation  until the BPA option is sorted out.  I am following 
 this sensible guidance and if anybody has a thought to the contrary please 
 give me a call:  503-464-7845.  ----cgy
