 
 Cliff,
 
 Thanks for lunch.  I always really enjoy getting together and talking about 
 life and our businesses.  Attached are the two presentations we discussed.  A 
 little airplane (or boat, sorry, ship) reading.  I would appreciate any 
 feedback.  I'll be making significant changes as I get ready for the analyst 
 meetings.
 
 Thanks,
 Mike
