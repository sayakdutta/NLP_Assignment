 I will not be able to attend the Monday Oct 29/01 weekly meeting on Sun Devil.
 I will be at the "Kick Off" Meeting for the start of construction on my Mississppi Pipeline Project.
 Please let me know if there is anything I can provide you with beforehand and I'll get it to you before this Friday.
 Thanks
