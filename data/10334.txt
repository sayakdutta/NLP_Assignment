 Mike and I met today and have completed creation and testing of the database processes to breakup storage as follows.  Dale's team can implement these changes when ever they desire.  Please call Mike or I with questions.

 Don,
 Last week we talked about the Net IDD number displayed on the referenced report and the benefits of displaying the Net PNR activity separately from Net Packet activity. As a follow-up to that conversation I was able to confirm that the Service Sub Type in CMS was used to differentiate PNR contracts from Packets agreements in TMS.
 PNR has No Contract "Service Sub Type"
 Packets have a Service Sub Type of "A" (Seasonal), "B" (Backdraft) or "U" (Other). The Packet activity can be combined and reported as one number. 
 In addition, I have asked Contracts to establish Service Sub Types of Traditional, Non Traditional, and Storage for Service Type: SBA Pack/Draft so that Pack & Draft activity can be reported separately from the other activity. It is my  recommendation that the SBA line on the subject report be changed to report Peak activity (Service Type: SBA Winter Peaking) separately from Traditional Pack/Draft. The Non Traditional and Storage Pack/Draft should be used in calculating the Unanticipated Swing but should not be displayed on the report.
 If you have any questions or would like to discuss further, please call me
