 
 Greg, I had a message to call Joe Dial yesterday.  I haven't called him back 
 yet.  Should I wait to hear from you?  Please advise.  Thanks, SRS
 
 
    
  
 FYI.
 
 We are meeting with Joseph Dial next Tuesday, a former CFTC commissioner and 
 friend of the Wendy Graham.  He had sent you a letter on March 1 about an 
 options and futures exchange he was building called eWorldTradeX, Inc.  I 
 don't know what he wants, but we are following up on it and we will let you 
 know about it, if necessary.
 
 Thanks.
 
 GP
  
     
 Mr. Skilling is traveling next Tuesday, so he won't be participating in the 
 meeting with Mr. Dial.  I've confirmed Bibi and Zipper.
