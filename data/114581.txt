 
 Both deals have been changed to reflect a flat $15 fee. And thanks so much 
 for following up with the IT request for a default change in EnPower. Just 
 let me know when you hear back.

 Can you please adjust the fees to reflect $15.00 flat.  FYI please select 
 flat instead per mw in the field to the right of currency field.
 
 Thanks

 That is the commission for those trades. The rate that Bloomberg Powermatch
 now charges for cash trades is $15 per trade.
