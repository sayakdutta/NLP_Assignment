 
 yea!  Great work, Valeria!  Michelle
 
 
     
 
 FYI; Jubran has signed the agreements; I think this matter is just about over.
 
 
     
 
 FYI
 
 
     
 
 Amy,
 
 I have signed both agreements.  You will receive them shortly.
 A few questions, will I receive all checks by the 15th?
 Is the $7500 a lump-sum payment also? I am assuming it is it.
 Will you be sending me all the information regarding my retained benefits,
 vacation hours, copies of the agreement signed, etc?
 Just general questions, do you want me to come in for an exit interview, or
 just do it over the phone?
 
 Thank you,
 
 Jubran
 
 
 
 
     
 
 Jubran -
 
 The revised information will be couriered to you this afternoon.
 
 Kind regards -
 Amy
