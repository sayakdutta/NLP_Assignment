 
 We have not admitted hedge funds to trade in the US because of the heightened 
 regulatory scrutiny of trading with hedge funds generally since the Long-Term 
 Capital Management debacle of last year.  These same issues may not apply in 
 the UK.

 Hi guys,
 
 I hope you can help me.  Are there any issues with us trading with Hedge 
 funds on EnronOnline?  Galtere have applied and seem to be one.
 I look forward to hearing from you.
 Regards
 Marie

 Subject to my comment below and to the Segregated Accounts notice (for 
 metals), I approve for all products, except for US power, credit and weather.
 
 However, in the case of the Galtere, please check with the US PCG whether 
 trading with Hedge funds gives rise to any particular legal issues.
