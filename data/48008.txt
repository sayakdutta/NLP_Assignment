 
 Attached is the list for 1/24/00. 
 
  For the list dated 1/25/00 which only had one amended counterparty, First 
 Energy Corp., I have a change in my earlier approval, from the Power Group.   
 I don't have a code for this, so I'll just tell you, for this Counterparty 
 Enron call SELL power only to them pursuant to an on-line GTC.  This 
 Counterparty cannot sell to us via EOL.
