 draining our little brains.  Let's all conference sometime Monday to sort 
 through how these trades should be documented, booked and otherwise handled.  
 Lynn has suggested that ESA is merely a holding company and therefore, an 
 inappropriate vehicle for holding trades (maybe one or two trades is O.K.).  
 Also, any ESA documents must be executed in the U.S.
