 
 You need to be aware that we are in the process of selling the Wind Co.  Mark 
 Metts and Amit Walya are working on this.  If the price changes under the QF 
 contracts it would impact the sale.  Call Amit to discuss (345-5570).

 Status Report
 After a marathon 12 hour meeting with Assemplyman Keeley, Senator Battin, QF 
 Parties, and SCE, a Keeley sponsored "deal" was proposed at 3:30 a.m. this 
 morning.  The crux of the deal is as follows:
  
 For renewables and non-gas fired QF, essentially ...
  
 7.8 cents/kwh for delivered power for 5 years ["all in", i.e. includes 
 capacity and energy]
 1.0 on losses
 no 'clawback' for wind resources which may have failed to meet fixed capacity 
 obligations in the past
 Applies "going forward" (presumedly Feb. 1)
  
  
 For gas-fired QFs...
  
 7.8 cents/kwh for five years, assuming gas is $5.60;  payment will 
 increase/decrease tied to gas  (this assumes an IER of 9821)
 1.0 on line losses
 applies "going forward"
 Caacity True-up and "forbearance" were not addressed.  Credit worthiness will 
 be address in the technical conference scheduled for later today (Sunday).  
 This program will require in part legislative blessing and direction, 
 followed by CPUC approval of individual contract amendments.  This is 
 essentially the PG&E/QF "deal" for the gas guys.  For the renewables, it is 
 more of a fixed payment approach.
  
 A "Technical Conference" is scheduled for Sunday (today) in Sacramento to 
 work out some of the implementing details.
