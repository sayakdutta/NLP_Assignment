 
 We have an opening for a paralegal in the Financial Trading group.  In the 
 past we have been very successful with referrals from members of the Legal 
 Dept. who know of paralegals with whom they have worked in local law firms 
 who might be willing to move.  Please give this a little thought and if you 
 know of a good paralegal in town, let me or Tana Jones know so we can contact 
 them.
 
 Thanks for you help.
