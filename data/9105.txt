 Attached is a preliminary draft of the findings and proposed action steps for 
 the MG - London controls review that was conducted this past week.  These 
 findings arise solely out of discussions with key MG personnel who are listed 
 within the attachment.  AA&Co. are still in the process of conducting the 
 deal test which should be completed by Monday.  Any significant findings as a 
 result of the deal test will then be added to this document.  Please review 
 and direct any questions or comments back to me or Tim Poullain-Patterson by 
 Monday, July 10.  Thanks.
