 
 This term sheet relates to a new deal of Mark Bernstein's.  We haven't 
 responded to it yet.  I suspect you will be consulted about it soon, so I 
 thought I would give you a heads up.  Roger and Herman have heard a bit about 
 the project, and Joe D has been briefed.
 
 Looks like more for TurboPark.

 It looks as though this did not go through the first time.  My apologies for
 the delay.

 > Further to our discussions last week, attached is a preliminary draft of
