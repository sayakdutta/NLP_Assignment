 yet found any other seminar that equals it.  I'll keep my eyes posted, 
 though.

 Are either of you aware of any master documentation workshops being offered 
 in NYC or London in the next few months that would be worthwhile for Jane 
 McBride to attend?  I remember several years ago going to a program that 
 Euromoney (or Eurocurrency) put on for 2-days focusing on ISDA's. 
 
 Please advise. Thanks.
