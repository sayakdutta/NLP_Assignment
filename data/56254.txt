 
 Ravi,
 
 It's fine with me. I think the expense is justified (as it's equal to the 
 cost of the alternative).

 FYI, I may have to stay over weekend. Vince, if that is the case, I may have 
 to bring my wife or allow her to go to her sister for a week etc.  I may ask 
 John to cover some of that cost as (I think) he is done with other people. 
 I've seen other guys family members showup. This cost would equal what EBS 
 would have spend to send me home and bring me back again, etc.
 
 Ravi.
