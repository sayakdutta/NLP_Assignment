 
 Hi Emmye,  Sorry I haven't gotten back with you sooner.  It has been 
 extremely busy here at work and I am leaving for Denver today at 5:30 so I am 
 really having to hustle to get things done before I leave.  How was the 
 wedding?  I know you really were just looking for any excuse to go to Tomball.
 
 I too had fun on Thursday.  I will give you a call when I get back from 
 Denver. I will be back on Sunday.  Take care and talk to you soon.
 
 Gerald
