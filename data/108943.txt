 Enclosed are my notes from the discussion we had with CERA this morning. The
 most important item is that CERA is revising their short-term forecast
 significantly downward (from high $4.00s to high to mid $3.00s this summer).
 This new forecast will be officially published next week. Please see  the
 attachment for more information.
