 Vince,
 
 Please find attached file with propane price statistics. There are two kinds 
 of data: (1) prompt month futures prices, no location specified, starting 
 from 1987; (2) index prices for different locations (North Sea, Venezuela and 
 Saudi Arabia), starting 1988. Source of both is Platts publications. 
 
 Please notice that price of futures in given in US cents/gallon, and index 
 prices in USD/MT.
 
 
 Sincerely, Elena
