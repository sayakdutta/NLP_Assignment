The woman at Merita we negotiated with was Paivi Saarnilahti and her phone number is 358 9 1655 9258.

 I need to know who you are talking to at Merita Bank.

 That is fine as I understand that it was Merita's suggestion that we use the ENA document as a starting point.  
 
 As ENA is the contracting party presumably the request for permission should come from you. Please let me or Darren Gurner know if you need any assistance.
 
 thank you

 Janet,
 
 Unfortunately, the confidentiality provisions contained in this agreement do not allow us to provide copies of the agreement to affiliates.  We will need the permission of Merita before I can provide a copy to you.
 
  
     
 
 Dear Tana
 Please could you provide me with a copy of the ISDA in place between Nordea Bank (previously Merita) and ENA.
 Many thanks
 Janet
  
     
 Can one of you guys have a look into the ISDA situation with Nordea Bank (formerly Merita). They had an ISDA with ENA but I believe that we are in the process of transfering it to ECTRIC.
 
 A progress report would be appreciated.
 
 Cheers
 
 Darren
