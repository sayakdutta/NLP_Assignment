 
 I'm sorry if I confused you with my e-mail last night, but I think I might 
 finally have the futures figured out. Now, instead of one deal number with no 
 counterparty name, we now have two deal numbers, two counterparties, and the 
 correct number of MW in each. Imagine that! Here is the updated information:
 
 467455
 10 MW
 175.00
 Palo Verde
 Southern Company Energy Marketing
 Mark Watson
 
 469098
 50 MW
 175.00
 Palo Verde
 Sempra Energy Trading
 Chris Bennett
 
 I hope this makes more sense; please let me know if there's anything else I 
 can do.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate
