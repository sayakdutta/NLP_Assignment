 to avoid paying for it.  It will be particularly difficult for Enron to 
 exempt itself from costs incurred by the state on behalf of Enron's 
 customers.  Prior to us pushing amendments on this bill, can we discuss on 
 the 11:30 call today.  Harry and I have discussed this at length, and I just 
 want to make sure that we don't blow up the whole enchilada by trying to get 
 an amendment here.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Hedy, Scott, Bev -  the language currently says the bond surcharge will apply 
 "to all electric power delivered in California by electric corporations ..."  
 I know this is a longshot, but is there any chance of having this amended to 
 either 
 
 1) exclude volumes under DA contracts as of the effective date of this act, 
 or 
 2) more generally leave it to the PUC to adjust the surcharge for customer 
 classes based on their contribution - or lack thereof - to DWR's purchasing 
 requirements.
 
 The justification for this exemption is grounded in excluding customers who 
 have not caused the DWR problem; e.g. large San Diego customers or PGE/SCE 
 customers who have been DA  the last couple years or parts thereof.  (We can 
 give you some specific language.)
 
 Hedy or Scott - could you please call me when you get in - 713 853-5786.  
 Thanks.

 Senator Burton's office expects bond language back from Legislative
 Counsel sometime tomorrow, Tuesday.  As soon as we get a copy we will
 forward it.  If the language is acceptable to Enron, then Bev, Scott and
 I need to visit with Republicans to urge their support as soon as
 possible.We are continuing to coordinate with the big users and some
 other suppliers on this issue.
