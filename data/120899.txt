When I got home, Suzanne came and got me and we went shopping and then to the grocery store.  Went home and laid on the couch for about an hour then met Suzanne at the park for a jog.  Then she came over and we grilled steak on the grill, stir fried some veggies, had a glass of wine and watched Sex in the City. 
 
 Lonely, huh?  When does Lawrence move in?

 Always!  The laugh is that Tosha gets here at 9 if she is lucky and Carl is an 8:45-9man!  I'm the early bird.  Both of them are ex bankers so they prefer working late.  How was your Sunday?  The rest of the day without me could only have been a let-down!
 
 I had fun with Rob.  I played horribly on what is a very short, but tight and tricky course.  88.  Then we had dinner at Champs.  I played Mr. Domestic and put Miracle Grow on all my shrubs and flowers.  My mom told me to do it a month ago and I have blown it off and some stuff died.  What an ingrate.
 
 Now I have empty nest syndrome now that Joe is gone!
