 work on the legal side?  Sara

 Sara,
 
 I had a call on this from Bob a few weeks ago.  I told him that generally it 
 was ok, but that we would need to revise our file should he require a 
 definitive position, plus we would need to ensure that advice which we 
 ploughed through earlier last year was still current.  He told me not to do 
 any more work on this at the time because it was not clear whether there was 
 any chance of doing a deal with an Indian counterparty.
 
 I am more than willing to send you ou all my notes, etc, however, which 
 crunched through the 1/14/97 opinion with Crawford's and asked supplemental 
 questions.
 
 Kind regards
 
 Mark 
 
 
    
  
 Mark:  ENA is looking into derivatives trading with an Indian corporate.  My 
 latest information is the opinion from 1/14/97 rendered by Crawford Bayley & 
 Co. (which was part of our global survey effort a few years ago).  Do you 
 have anything more recent?  The ENA inquiry came from the pulp and paper 
 group.  Thanks for your help.  Sara
