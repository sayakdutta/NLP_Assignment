 Agree.

 Given everything that we've got on our plate, and the relative priority of 
 the affiliate issue, and the fact that ARM and Wild Goose are involved, I 
 would propose that we take a pass on this one.  Thoughts?
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Dear Jeff and Sue:
 
 Sorry to be a broken record on this one....but I don't know what you want to
 do about the Affiliates case.  There is a PHC tomorrow and comments were
 filed.  SCE's comments make a nasty jab at Enron for proposing the rules in
 the first place.  I see that AReM is participating as well.  If your plan is
 to participate in this proceeding only through AReM, that's fine but please
 let me know so that I can remove my appearance.  I will be at the PHC for
 Wild Goose but would like to be very clear about who I am representing in
 the docket in order to avoid confusion.  
 
 Thanks,
