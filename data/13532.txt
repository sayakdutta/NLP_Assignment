 Sorry, Tara that I have not sent this to you yet.  I have made the changes 
 already.  Let me get Michelle to take a final look at this and I will send it 
 to you this morning.

 Can I do this myself? I used to just run with the draft that you/Twanda sent 
 and removed the confidential header. Can I no longer do this? I would like to 
 get this to Mark today so please let me know.
 
 Thanks
 Tara

 Tara,
 
 We can make the salary retroactive as part of the contract.  Have we already 
 sent you executables?  If so, we can re-run with a provision that states, 
 "Effective 3/1/00, Employee's Monthly Base Salary shall be $xxxx."  The 
 effective date still can be 6/1.
 
 Twanda, would you please make that change and run executables?
 
 Thanks.
 
 Michelle

 On the nomination form for Mark Schroeder's agreement, it requests to 
 backdate the salary to March 1st, even though the effective date of the 
 agreement is not until June 1st. Can this be incorporated into the agreement 
 or do we need to do a side letter to Mark?
 
 Thanks
 Tara
