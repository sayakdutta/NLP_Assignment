 Cecilia,
 
 We need to get some new books set up in ERMS this week for Netco.  We will be taking over this responsibility from the controls group but they are reluctant to grant us access to RisktRAC now due to security reasons.  These books are needed for many downstream groups and therefore must be set up soon.  Can you set these up before they are in risktrac this time due to these limitations?  I can give you the book and portfolio codes and the TAGG short names.
 
 Please let me know today so we can start ASAP.
 
 Thanks
 
 Kam
