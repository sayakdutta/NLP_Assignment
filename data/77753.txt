 Kay,
 I do not have the materials.  You will get them next Wed. at class.
 You may just hang on to your check and bring it with you next Wed.  If you 
 really want to drop the check off earlier, I am at EB-1676.
 
 Thanks,
 Michelle
 
 
 
    
 Since I've had to miss the first 2 meetings due to travel, is it possible for 
 me to drop off my check and pick up any materials?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
