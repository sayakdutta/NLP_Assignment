 Hey you guys,
 
 We are trying to implement a 'VaR transaction' policy - and would like your 
 opinion.
 
 This is going to be tough - because I'm not sure we have implemented a 
 similiar policy across any of our other 'books' - that is - we looking to 
 bring in all the accrual/operational assets as well as the MTM stuff 
 (lambdas). To have a real-live 'configuration' of the system.
 
 If assets/routes/servers etc...are added - what is the impact on the 'value' 
 of the system and what it's worth. 
 
 John has attached a draft below - for your review and thoughts.
 
 I can see how this works in a trading environment - when you actually know 
 the VaR of your whole trading portfolio. However - I've not seen this done 
 with a mixture of MTM & accrual assets. Add the spice of a 'operational 
 system' valuation  - and this will be tough to quantify and model.
 
 Step 1 - configure system and value it 
 Step 2 - calculate a VaR on this. We will need to do some work here!
 Step 3 - calculate the incremental VaR of new deals/amendements/reconfigs etc 
 - tough....
 
 See what you think?
 
 B.

 I would like you to start looking at where we are going on the policy and get 

 effectively shut down all server relocations without approval,  or allow some 
 level of MB of storage to be moved around or reconfigured?
 
 I need some commercial and industry realism for this.  We may need Rick 
 Paiste or your industry helpers (Marquardt, etc. to help us).
 
 Barry,  Lou,  I need your input.
