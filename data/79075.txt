 Dear Larry,
 =20
           How are  things?  How is your family doing?  I recently got back =
 from a  great vacation with my family in Vancouver.  Since leaving Enron I =
 have  been very busy rehabbing some old houses in the Rice University  area=
 .  I am very excited as we have some tenants about to move  in.  It's a rea=
 l sense of accomplishment to work through a project like  that from start t=
 o finish.  You can check out my website at www.bluezephyr.com << File: http=
 ://www.bluezephyr.com >>  . I should have  some pictures up of the properti=
 es by the end of the week.  Anyway, I  wanted to let you know that I am bus=
 y applying to other companies in the Houston  area and have used your name =
 as my supervisor and contact reference for my time  at Enron.  I hope you d=
 on't mind?  Some of these companies might  contact you as part of my backgr=
 ound check!  Anyway, how are things at  work?  It seems that the media real=
 ly can't get enough of the Enron  mess.  Do you plan to stay with UBS? Do y=
 ou have a home email  account?  Well, I hope everything is going well for y=
 ou!  All the  best! =20
