 Dear Friends,
 
 In case you missed it last week I am circulating a press release announcing
 our new fixed rate pricing plan for the San Diego area.  8.5 cents per kWh,
 no monthly fee, 100% renewable, price guaranteed for a year.
 
 As we debate how to modify the California electric market, this type of
 product structure may be a good model for small customer default service.
 That is, perhaps small customers should get a fixed price, for a fixed
 period, that is known in advance, as opposed to a floating price that
 changes every month and that the customer only learns 30 days after they use
 it.
