 Kim -
 
 Neil has decided to leave the company.  Neil says he is just burned-out and needs to help his parents for awhile and give some thought to his career.  Neil has agreed to help us through the 21st if we desire.  Can you help me work through the appropriate exit process for Neil.
 
 Also, Brian Butler has decided to leave to take a position with Reliant.  Brian has been doing our day-to-day URM reporting for the past several months.  Brian was ranked a five and feels as though he/the group's obstacles have been underestimated.  Honestly, I have not heard anything but positives on this person and do not think we should let him just walk out.  I duscussed with him and he would very much like to stay with Enron, especially given some of the proposed personnel/structural changes we are undertaking.  Could you provide a summary of employee history on Brian so we can make a quick call - he is due to leave next week.
 
 Thanks,
 Rogers
