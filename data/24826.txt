 I bought a place in Altadore / River Park. Right near where Blair lives. #402 3511 14a st. SW. Great place and great area. I'll be in the office next Thursday and Friday and then I am back in Houston for a week. Start in Calgary Monday the 17th for good. See you next week.

 Hey,
 
 Just got back from some time off.  Congrats on the house.  Where did you buy?  When are you coming up?  I'll let you know all the details of the offsite as soon as we know - it should be a good time.
 
  
     
 What are the details of this offsite? Make sure to count me in. Bought a house this weekend. No sense wasting any time. I'll call you later.
