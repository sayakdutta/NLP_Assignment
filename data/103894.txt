 
 Joel:  thanks - everything was sent out as draft as we don't have all 
 internal comments (and we don't even know ABN's position!).  Sara

 A few thoughts:
 1. Section 2.1 (y) the .30% should specify per annum
 2. Section 2.1 contemplates that interest is payable monthly--this seems to 
 conflict with the provisions of Section 3.1 which makes it payable on demand. 
 Am I missing something?
 3. Section 3.5 should we specify a time of day?
 
 I have reviewed this via remote access, and am not able to print. I think 
 more thought should go into the mechanics and timing  of what is going on 
 here. I will be available next week. Can we have another meeting?
