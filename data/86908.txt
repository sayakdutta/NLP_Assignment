 Susan - Here is the section of the tariff that is currently available on the TGT website that applies to our situation for October:
 
 Customers using in-kind replacement for imbalance resolution have thirty (30) days from date of notification by Transporter to nominate and resolve their imbalances. Imbalances not resolved within this thirty (30) day period are subject to cash-out at the 5% to 10% Net Imbalance Percentage for determining the Cash-Out Index Price. The cash-out index price to be used for cash-out shall be the greater of the month in which the imbalance occurred or the month in which the imbalance is cashed out. If Customer makes a good faith effort throughout the 30 days provided for in-kind replacement of imbalance volumes, but is unable to fulfill its in-kind make-up obligations solely as a result of Texas Gas's inability to take or deliver such make-up gas, then Texas Gas will cash- out Customer's imbalance at 100% monthly average index. 
 
 Thus for October production, since we are short gas,  the gas price would be 110% of the highest price  for October or for November.
 
 I am going to get with Suzanne Calcagno to find out the status of the TGT tariff filings and if it is still going to be effective retro  to  October.
