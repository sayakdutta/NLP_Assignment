 
 Hey, you know my email doesn't update automatically, I actually have to 
 refresh it manually.  It sucks....
 
 So, yes changes were good....although......I don't exactly know which changes 
 you were referring to, but I'll pick which ones I would have liked you to be 
 thinking of.  Anyway, I think I'm heading out to happy hour soon with jeff, 
 so you'll have to call if you want to communicate.
 
 Later.
