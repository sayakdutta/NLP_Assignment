 coordinate with Sarah and Accounting.  Is it Mary Lynn that I should talk to?

 Thanks for the information.  If I deciphered this correctly, this is going to 
 be what I would call an "autoborrow" facility ... Enovate's cash flow is 
 swept into an account.  Each day:  (i) if Enovate's cash position is short 
 (and availability remains under the loan agreements) advances are made under 
 each loan agreement (probably directly into the acount), and (ii) if 
 Enovate's position is long, the positive balance of the account is applied 
 towards the outstanding loan balances, if any.  We'll need to get minimum 
 target amounts (i.e., do you really want them paying down $1.00 of each 
 loan?) from the business people.
 
 Based on the foregoing, I suspect that these will be single-lender, prime 
 rate based loan agreements (otherwise it would be a huge operational 
 headache).  Once you confirm the single lender part, that will be enough 
 preliminary information for me to start on a loan agreement.

 Hi Heather,
 
 Don't have the answers to your questions, but I wanted you to see the
 attachment to Gregg's email.  It outlines some of the commercial aspects of
 the loan agreement, although it might not be in a form you can easily
 decipher.

 1.  I haven't seen the paperwork on the name change.  I asked around
 yesterday, and I have someone checking it out.  Initially going through
 Corp (vs. ENA) made it a bit more complicated to track down.
 
 2.  I believe I sent you a form services agreement to review.  I think that
 the parameters for performing certain services can be captured by way of
 reference to a named guideline or procedure, or by attachment as an
 exhibit.  I will resend the email for your easy reference.
 
 Hope this helps.

 1-Is there anything left to do to change the name under the LLC agreement
 to enovate?
    2-I am attaching the overview cash protocol that was discussed during
 our meeting with Treasury, Accounting and Finance.  Who can begin crafting
 a services agreement around this template?
 (See attached file: Cash Protocol.doc)
 That's it for this moment.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Gregg
