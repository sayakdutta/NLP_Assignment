 
 I have prepared a draft for enovate and CPS  from Rudwell Johnson's credit 
 sheet dated 6/1.   I also have CPS's redline comments to your discussion with 
 Randy which is Jeff's draft, and I have CPS's redline comments to a  draft 
 between ENA / CPS.
 
 I have not discussed any of the above with the counterparty.
