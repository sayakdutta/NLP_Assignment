 Ahab Garos, a young intern at McDonald during 1997-98, was deposed in New 
 York this week.? We concluded that this particular deposition was not worth 
 the expense of our attending personally, but we will be obtaining a rough 
 transcript tomorrow and a final one later.? It is unlikely that Garos had any 
 significant contact with Enron, and Mike Swartz advised us before the 
 deposition that he did not intend to ask any "Enron questions."
 
 Next week Aaron Izowar of White & Case is being deposed.? We think we should 
 attend that deposition, and Roland is planning on doing so, unless you 
 disagree.? Izowar coordinated a lot of the work in preparing the offering 
 memorandum and is likely to be asked about Enron's role in that process.
