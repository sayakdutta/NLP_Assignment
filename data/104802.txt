 SITA may be anxious but their lawyers raised a few new issues that we are 
 responding to.  Also, we have not finalized the Enron Corp. guaranty.  Sara

 Further to our recent telcon and mails re the above CP, pls can you advise 
 the status of the documentation, and when the CP can reasonably expect to 
 receive them.  They are anxious to sign the docs and to commence transacting 
 at the earliest opportunity.
 
 Any update would be much appreciated so that I can advise the client.
 
 Best regards
 Tom
