 Mr. Derrick,
 
 I met with Robert Taylor this week at your residence and had a very productive meeting.  One question that came up was the use of security cameras.  Areas that we discussed using cameras were:
 
 Gate at Larchmont
 Driveway gate
 
 Please let me know if that is something that you are interested in or would like to discuss.
 
 thanks Alan
