 
 For April, 
 
 We agree to nominate 60,000 into Eastrans.  With redeliveries of:   50,000 
 into PG&E
             7,800 into HPL at Fuels Cotton Valley
              2,200 to HPL at Carthage
 
 Pricing for any additional volumes will need to be renegotiated.
 
 You may contact either myself or Stacey Neuweiler.
 
 
 
 





  
 
 
 
 Effective 4/1/2000:
 
 Nomination into Eastrans of 75,000 MMBtu/d.
 
 Redeliveries:
 
 50,000 MMBtu/d into PG & E
 7,800 from Fuels Cotton Valley
 17,200 to HPL at Carthage
 
 Currently, since 3/22/2000, we have been at 75,000
 with the following redeliveries:
 
 43,482 MMBtu/d into PG & E
 7,000 from Fuels Cotton Valley
 3,000 into HPL Cartwheel
 21,518 to Mobil Beaumont
 
 I previously showed 44,382 MMBtu/d since 3/22 .  Is 43,482 right?
 
 There is no change in deliveries and redeliveries for tomorrow, but
 could someone clarify what the nominations are on the redelivery side?
