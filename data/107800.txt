 
 Hope you're well.  I'll be over sometime this quarter.  Of course the new 
 house isn't furnished yet.  Who has time to go the grocery store?
 The hotel is the Hotel Costes on the Foubourg (sp?) St. Honore.  It's muy 
 bueno.  Please, let's not telll the world about this gem.

 Jeff,
 
 When you get a chance, could you email me the name of that hotel in Paris you 
 were telling me about?  My friend Megan and I are going to pop over to Paris 
 for a weekend later this month and we might check it out.
 
 Hope everything is well with you.  Is the new house all furnished?  Will we 
 be seeing you on this side of the world anytime soon?
 
 Happy New Year!
 
 Regards,
 Merritt
