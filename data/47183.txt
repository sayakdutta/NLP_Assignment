 
 Per our meeting, attached are the current forms of MAC Clauses.  I have added 
 at the end of the list, the Event of Default for change in ownership because 
 I know that one comes up frequently.  Also, I don't know if you want to also 
 suggest that the other trading groups work from our guaranty forms as well as 
 our LC form.
 
 The Legal heads of each of the trading groups are:
 
 Mark Taylor:  Financial Trading
 Jeff Hodge:  Physical Gas Trading
 Elizabeth Sager:  Physical Power Trading
 Alan Aronowitz:  Physical Global Markets (Liquids, Plastics, Coal, Emissions 
 & Metals)
 Julie Murray:  Physical Industrial Markets (Pulp & Paper, Steel)
