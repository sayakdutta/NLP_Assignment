 I could not open the file.  What are you interested in doing?

 Mr. Shankman:
 
 My name is Robert Brown and I am a fellow alumnus of the Wharton School.  I
 noticed that you provided your name on the Penn Career Network as a mentor
 for other alumni.  I have just returned from a sabbatical and am currently
 seeking to enter the energy industry in Houston now that I have returned
 stateside.  As a person who has achieved a prominent position in the
 industry in which I am interested, I thought you might be able to help me in
 my endeavors with some advice.
 
 Would it be possible for me to contact you at a convenient time, so that I
 might be able to ask you a few questions?  Please feel free to call me on my
 cell phone at 832.541.5805 or you can also reach me through e-mail by
 responding to this e-mail.  Thank you for making yourself available to other
 alumni like myself.  I look forward to speaking to you.
 
 Regards,
 
 Robert L. Brown
 W'97
