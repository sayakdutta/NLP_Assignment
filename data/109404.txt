 
 Good morning, Yelba.  
 
 It has been a long time!  You may not remember me, but I have been working 
 with Jeff since the McKinsey days (my name used to be "Baumbach").  
 
 After reviewing your e-mail, Jeff suggests that you speak to Lou Pai, 
 Chairman & CEO of Enron Energy Services; his telephone number is 
 713.853.5646.  By copy of this e-mail, he is advised that you will contact 
 him.
 
 Good luck with your venture, Yelba, and welcome back to Houston.  If I can be 
 of assistance, please don't hesitate to call me.  And please tell Richard 
 that we said hello.
 
 Regards,
 Sherri Sera

 Hi Jeff,
 Don't know if you remember me from your old McKinsey days, but I am Richard
 Saettone's wife. The entire family is finally back in Houston after several
 years in Peru.  I am working for a company called Home-Link Services, and
 wanted to request your aid in finding the correct person to talk to at Enron
 regarding our business model.
 
 We currently represent over 200,000 transactions per year (people moving),
 and one of the most requested services from our customers is the connection
 of utilities.  As an aggregator for the energy sector with that type of
 volume, who do you recommend we call?  We are expected to grow to about
 500,000 transactions by year-end.
 
 Feel free to call me with any questions.  I would be most happy to send you
 or the proper Enron contact an executive summary for review.
 
 Richard sends his regards and we hope your family is doing well.
