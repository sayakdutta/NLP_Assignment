 
 The floors chosen for these meetings appear to be geared to the IT teams.  
 Between my operations teams dedicated to EA, EGM and EIM, I have roughly 500 
 employees in the Enron building.  Do you want all of them to choose one of 
 the floors noted in your e-mail message, or would it be better to schedule 
 one or two floor meetings in locations that more easily incorporate this 
 segment of Net Works?  I have noted below the approximate number of employees 
 per floor (including only those floors with a significant number of 
 operations employees):  
 
   29th Floor (trading) 67 employees  EGM risk, vol. mgmt., confirms, 
 settlements and EIM risk 
 
   30th Floor (trading) 35 employees  EGM risk, confirms, settlements (various 
 products) 
 
   31st Floor (trading) 52  employees  Power risk, confirms, vol. mgnt., 
 settlements and DPR           and MPR teams
   
   32nd Floor (trading) 117 employees  Gas risk, logistics (all regions), 
 operational analysis
 
      
   37th Floor   148 employees  Gas vol. mgmt., settlements, and global 
 services       
 Also, given the fact that operations is a relative "newcomer" to Enron 
 Networks and yet represents a large number of employees in the group, I would 
 be happy to work with you on remarks for all of the floor meetings to make it 
 easier for you to be fully inclusive in these sessions.   --Sally
