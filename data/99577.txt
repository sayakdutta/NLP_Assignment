 JOINT GUIDANCE COMMITTEE

 WESTERN MARKET INTERFACE COMMITTEE
 INTERCHANGE SCHEDULING and ACCOUNTING SUBCOMMITTEE
 
 
 Dear JGC, OC, WMIC and ISAS,
 
 On November 29, 2001, the WSCC Joint Guidance Committee (JGC) approved
 formation of a new working group to coordinate western positions and/or
 proposals on Electronic Scheduling issues and practices.  This new working
 group (called the WSCC Electronic Scheduling Work Group or ESWG) will
 report to the JGC and coordinate with the OC, WMIC and ISAS.  Attached
 please find the ESWG Scope Statement.
 
 As many of you are aware, the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative currently
 being facilitated by NERC is moving forward at a rapid pace on many issues.
 In order to be more productive and proactive with the formation of
 electronic scheduling issues and practices, the ESWG would like to make you
 aware of this new group and invite your participation and assistance to
 more adequately ensure a broader representation of WSCC interests.  To this
 end, if you are interested in being an active member of this work group, or
 if you are interested in being on the email exploder for this group, please
 reply to this email as follows:
 
 Please provide (via reply to this email):
 1. Your name and organization
 2. Your email address
 3. Yes/No for being an active member (i.e. - you will provide comments,
 attend meetings, etc as feasible)
 4. Yes/No for being on the ESWG email exploder (you will receive all emails
 of the working group)
 
 Please note - if your name is listed below, then you will automatically be
 added on the working group email exploder and there is no need to reply to
 this email (unless you want to be removed).
 
 Current email list -
































 
 For those who may be interested and to help facilitate meeting scheduling,
 the next ESC meeting (coordinated by NERC) is scheduled for Jan 16th (8-5)
 and Jan 17th (8-12) in Las Vegas.  The next WSCC ESWG meeting is scheduled
 for Jan 17th (1-5) in Las Vegas.
 
 Thank you in advance for your interest and help -
