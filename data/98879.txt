 Do you know if we have sued a company by the name of TDC Corporation in the 
 Eastern District of Louisiana on a collar agreement?
 
 Please advise. Thanks.

 Alan, sorry I was not clear.  I understand now that Enron has sued TDC in
 the Eastern District of Louisiana and we are or will be representing TDC in
 that lawsuit.  Again, if that knocks us out of the Orion deal, we are sorry
 to lose the opportunity to work with you, but understand.  If you are not
 uncomfortable with our representation of TDC in this unrelated matter, TDC
 has agreed to waive the conflict.  Marilyn

 Marilyn:
 
 Sorry, it has taken me awhile to respond.
 
 Could you clarify that Liskow & Lewis is not representing TDC in a
 proceeding against Enron?
 
 Thanks.

 Laurie and Alan: confirming my call with Laurie today, our existing client
 has waived the potential conflict we mentioned, and I ask your advice as to
 whether Enron would also be willing to waive.
 
 The potential conflict is in a totally unrelated matter.  We represent TDC
 Corporation.  I understand that there is a dispute between TDC and Enron
 relating to a collar agreement.  I am not certain if this is merely in
 dispute or if it is the subject of litigation at this point.
 
 If Enron is not interested in our undertaking the representation at the
 Orion facility, we certainly understand.  If it is, would it be possible to
 obtain a waiver of the unrelated conflict?
 
 Thank you for your patience in this matter.  Marilyn
