 
 Jeff,
 
 Derek stopped by after he talked to his wife over the phone and it looks like 
 he will probably take the job.  He wants to talk to her again tonite, and he 
 will let me know officially tommorrow.  So he can let Joe Hunter know -- any 
 idea on when they'll want him to start?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Errol
