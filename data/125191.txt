 After speaking to a NW Natural representative, I was told to contact you for more
 specifics regarding information on your customer breakdown. 
 I am interested in gas load by residential, industrial, and electrical generation on a weekly
 or monthly basis. Your financial statements have a quarterly cross-section in a fairly
 similar format, but I was hoping I could get more specific numbers, including the type
 of industrial user (high-tech, aluminum, agricultural, etc.) and historicals back to last
 winter. If you could help me out I would greatly appreciate it, as trying to forecast NWPL
 load without some general NW Natural data is impossible.
 
 Thanks,
