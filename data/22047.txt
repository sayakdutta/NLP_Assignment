 David,
 Per my phone message, I have been informed through my friend at British Petroleum (Andrew Netemeyer, VP Electric Trading) that there has been an inquiry to Mr Frevert via voice mail by Mr. Tony Fountain (President, BP Energy) about wholesale issues and retail interests of Enron.  They appear to have some issues on the wholesale side to discuss but have significant interest in the retail books of business with EES and wish to discuss these with you asap..Andrew Netemeyer would bring a Mr. Bill Burton in their M&A department into the loop and I beleive they have already had some individuals assigned to due some due diligence if Enron will entertain the interest.  Mr Netemeyer's number is (281) 366-4998, and any assistance I can provide regarding introductions or relationship let me know, they have been considering the expansion of retail gas & power and the timing may be right... 
 Regards, 
 MVA
