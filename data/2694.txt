 
 thank god i got out on friday.  had a much better month trading crude than gas.
 
  
     
 no i idea i have been waiting for 5 hours to sell wti since gasoioil and brent are puking---i guess we'll both have to  call bill 37037
 
 sadly we'll both have to engage in verbal communication...personally i think you should see as much crude as you can ..this should be a good week for puke #2
