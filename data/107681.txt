 Jeff,
 Congratulations on yesterday's earnings release - the market reacted well.
 Feedback I got from a large bank on the street is that they always recommend
 buying ENE in the weeks leading up to earings releases.  I don't want to be
 a pain, but you had said to let you know if I had not heard from Jeff by
 today.  I'm happy to be the one to make the call - just let me know.
 
 Halley and Michael's opening was quite successfull and the show is great.
 have fun in London.
 Nat
