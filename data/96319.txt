 Elizabeth:  PG&E cannot accept the added language as you have presented it;
 as you well appreciate, it arguably would have the effect of diminishing
 PG&E's current rights.  I have accepted your changes and provided a revision
 that I think more fairly preserves each party's status quo rights.  Please
 keep in mind that PG&E already is agreeing to a modification of the LC
 drawing events as an accommodation to Enron.  In light of that and of our
 need to cooperate and move forward, I hope you can leave things as they
 appear in this revision.  I'll try to call you tomorrow to confirm.  And,
 thanks for attending to this.  Larry
 
 
 
 
     
 
 
 In accordance with my voice mail, here is a revised standstill that
 incorporates the concept I referred to in my voice mail.  Please give me a
 call after you've had a chance to review.
 
 Thanks

 Elizabeth:  Good to hear from you.  David Anderson is immersed in the
 agreement, and he should be the one youwork with on it (415-973-6659;

 stand-still agreement, which, as I last understood it, had only one
 remaining issue, namely, the wording of the drawing provision for the LCs.
 Can we get that one behind us, also?  Thanks.  Larry
 
 
     
 
 
 Hi Larry
 
 
 I spoke with Peter Keohane and Mark Powell from our Canadian office and
 they would be available at any time today, Tues the 8th , to go over the
 Canadian Gas Master between ECC and PG&E.  Let me know what time works for
 you.
 
 Thanks
