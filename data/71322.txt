 yes, I think this is part of it. Also, for that reason, Ron Jolle, attorney
 for the City of Chicago attended the hearing today and indicated that the
 City would intervene. One likely reason for the concern over potential
 abuse is that, after a lengthy delay, I understand that the ICC has again
 turned its attention to rules of conduct for gas utility affiliated
 interests. They had started a proceeding to work rules, but there had been
 no activity for many months. The ICC Staff has apparently been reviewing
 rules of conduct in connection with resumed activity regarding the rules.
                                          At the hearing today, Jerry Fox
 and Mary Klyshaff represented Peoples and North Shore. ICC was represented
 by John Feeley and John RIeichart. Ron Jolle represented the City of
 Chicago. David Gilbert is the Hearing Examiner. (He's a good examiner.)
 There was no substantive discussion re issues. The schedule is: Feb.
 28-Staff and Intervenor direct; March 28-Company rebuttal; Apr. 5-11:00am
 status hearing (this was included in the schedule primarily to permit early
 conclusion in the event that there are no issues raised or that the issues
 are resolved);April 27- Staff/Intervenor  Rebuttal; May 11 Company
 Surrebuttal; May 23 10:00am hearing.   If there are disputed issues, the
 hearing would be followed by briefing, issuance of an Examiner's proposed
 order and biriefs/replies on exceptions.
