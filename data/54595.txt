 Dear Mr. Kaminski,
 ?
 I hope I got your title right. I looked everywhere  for it and I could not 
 find it. In one of the numerous discussions I had with  professor Shreve 
 about you I remember having heard "head of research"...  probably energy, but 
 that I could not recall. Is this ok? Also I would like to have the title of 
 the conference, it is useful!  
 ?
 Finnally, there is a request for your e-mail by a  PHD student, Do you allow 
 me to provide this info?
 ?
 ?
 Sincerely,
 ?
 Pierre-Philippe  Ste-Marie
