 Here is what I've been able to learn about the hedges of the TW index rate 
 deals.
 Morgan has been working in connection with Dan Fancler, Tracy Geaccone (sp?) 
 and Dave Neubauer to make sure these can go under FAS 133 and for any other 
 analysis that needs to be done.  They will continue to do so on the other 
 deals and I'll follow up.  I am satisfied the interim procedures are being 
 followed.  Questions -- let me know.
