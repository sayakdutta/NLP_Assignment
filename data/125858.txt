 I don't have a need for traders here in Calgary now.  I don't have a softcopy of the application.  He should think about Harvard and MIT
 
  
     
 
 hey john,
 
 a few more things.  do you think Enron may be hiring any traders any time?
 if so, maybe you could let ali know (he's still figuring out what to do).
 also, do you have a soft copy of your UChicago MBA application?  ali's
 going to write his GMAT in Sept. and start to apply to bus school.  He's
 thinking of applying to Chicago, Columbia, Wharton, Kellogg, and Stanford.
 Any thoughts on those?

    Hi John,
 
    Remember i told you about the guy at work who got fired last week -- he
    has
    a brand new baby and just bought a new house?  Anyway, he wanted to
    speak
    to people in the oil and gas industry (his wife is originally from
    Calgary
    and they may be interested in moving back).  I think he just wants
    general
    info about the type of work you do (or others in the field) and what he
    should think about in terms of applying to firms.  Is it okay if i give
    him
    your number?  If so, would you prefer work or home?
 
    livia
