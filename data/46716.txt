 should be documented as Enron Power Marketing, Inc.  "Long Term California" 
 is just a book on the West Desk

 We have recently traded a few deals between EPMI Long Term California and 
 Risk Management and Trading Corp. The way these are booked now indicates that 
 a Confirm will need to be generated between the two. Joe Hunter thinks that 
 these should probably be book to book transactions. The EPMI Long Term 
 California entity has not been used for financial nat gas transactions before 
 this. Can you shed some light on to whether or not EPMI should be considered 
 a subsidiary similar to ECC or EES.
 
 Thanks.
