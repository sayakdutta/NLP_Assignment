 been extremely busy.  Most of the other attorneys are gone and I am catching 
 all their overflow.  
 
 The days off were mellow.  Went to Corpus Christi to see the family.  Usually 
 holiday cheer.  How about you?

 Hey -
 Good to actually see you.
 I thought maybe you were on vacation or something.  You never emailed me
 back - or did I piss you off?
 I wasn't trying to be rude if so.  Just being good ole sarcastic me.
 
 How were your holidays?
