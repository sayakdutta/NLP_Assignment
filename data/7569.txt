 
 There are five summer interns and six recent full-time hires from OU that I 
 will invite to the cookout at my house on Sunday, July 30th.  I asked Jody's 
 opinion on whether or not they would like to bring along a guest, and his 
 answer was yes.  So I will invite all to bring a spouse/guest.  
 
 I thought that I would also include Lexi Elliott, the recruiter from the 
 Analyst Program that will be covering OU.  Have you decided on the make-up of 
 the recruiting team at OU in the fall?  If so, this might be a good event in 
 which to include them as well.  I left you a voice mail message about James 
 Scribner as a potential good member of the team.  Let me know your thoughts 
 and I can include anyone else that you would like.  
 
 I plan to get invitations out to everyone by July 7.
