 See Dave's message below.  You guys have to give me every bit of information that give us as much texture as to the criticalness of any payment coming out of your area.  We are having to clear EVERY payment through a central ENE clearing led by George Wasaff.  We have to describe in as much detail as possible why any payment made preserves value to the company.
 
 Thanks for all your help and sorry this is so detailed.

 Wade, you need to give George and Ray more texture ie) we lose $30M in value - in active sale mode that looks promising and we buy Enron ten days with New York ISO.
