 Good Morning Debra - I have attached a revised copy of the GISB Agreement
 and Special Provisions for your review and consideration.   I anticipate
 completing the review of the Master Agreement form and submitting comments
 to you by Monday.
 
 In addition, I received feedback from our Gas Desk that the access to the
 Gas segment of Enron On-Line was cut off to CPS --- do you know who would
 handle this at Enron that we can speak to?  Greatly appreciate your prompt
 feedback to this inquiry.
 
 I look forward to your feedback on the GISB.
 
 Regards,

 PS- Were you having  phone system problems this morning?   Myself and Credit
 were calling in and none of the calls rolled into voice mail (?).
 
 
     
 
 Further to our conversation,  please see attached  sample agreements.
 Upon your review, please give me a call to discuss any questionsand or
 issues you may have regarding this matter.
