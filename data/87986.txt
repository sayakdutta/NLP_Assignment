 One of them had diarrhea on Monday night / Tuesday morning.  I took her to
 the vet and they gave me pills for her.  After that she has been fine.
 Sounds like yours really had it bad.  Mine may not have had a virus though.
 It may just have been coincidental.  I hope that Tizzer and Geronimo are
 better now.  Hope that things are going well.  Our business, hence our
 department also, announced that we will be cutting a few positions/people
 very soon.  We are all laying low.  Oh well, we shall see.
 
 Take care of you!

 How are your dogs?  You should be aware there is a nasty virus going around
 which both of mine have had concerning each end.
