 
 I was trying to tell you that the blonde chick from Donna's group is down 
 here.  The woman that's always whining about something.  She's driving me 
 nuts.  That and the fact that I had a long meeting this morning with your 
 other buddy, Chris Disable.  All we did was go in circles for about 45 
 minutes.
 
 How's your day going?
