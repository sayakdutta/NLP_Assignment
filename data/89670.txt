 Kevin - 
 
 I am going to tell Joe to drop this issue.

 Rogers,
 
 Let me know when you have two seconds to give me some clue as to what to do about this email.  I am trying to get granted my orig for this transaction and this is the response I get from Heather.  If the orig amount doesn't matter for performance measures, then I will drop it.  The original agreement with Ozzie and Heather was that my orig would be the value of some put they sold to either CPL or AIG.  That value is $1.6MM.  I don't really care about the orig value, but if it helps me in the long run, I would like to have it next to my name.

 Help, what are you talking about?  We booked $7.6mm for the sale of the plants to AIG and $1.6mm for the put option.  These amounts have been in the books since Q1 for the plant sale and Q3 for the put.

 Heather,
 
 I am following up on that email I sent you a while back regarding the origination for the Alamac deal.  The origination was supposed to be the value of the put that was sold.  Can you give me the status of this?  Thanks.
 
 -Joe
