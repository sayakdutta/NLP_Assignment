 
 Attached is a clean and redlined copy of the CIG agreement with my 
 revisions.  The redline is compared against the version you had forwarded 
 earlier via email.  Sorry for the delay.  I will be at the ENA Legal 
 Conference this afternoon and tomorrow.  Please leave a voicemail if you have 
 any questions.  Thanks.
