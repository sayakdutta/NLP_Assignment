 Gov's finance people.

 Folks:
 
 Here is a rewrite of the power point presentation referenced in the previous 
 note.  Again, please keep confidential and do not distribute.  It's the copy 
 that Hertzberg used to present to his caucus.Thanks.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
 
 P.S.  Our numbers show that noncore for Edison would be about 30% of load; 
 Hertzberg has it at about 20%.
