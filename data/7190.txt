 
 Patti delivered to Sharron's desk this week a copy of my 2000 
 accomplishments.   You should find that when you return to the office.  Let 
 me know if for some reason you do not have that copy, and I will have another 
 delivered.  
 
 Have a happy new year!  I will be at the Cotton Bowl watching Meagan's drill 
 team perform - and also watching some of the game.  Thankfully, no emotional 
 attachment to either team in that game!  I just hope that we don't freeze.
