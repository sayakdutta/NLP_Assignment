 Here's the Risk Management Policy Gregg has been working on for MEH.  
 
 Jeff, I don't know if you have seen this, so I thought I would float it by 
 you.
 
 David, I'm sending it to you so that you can comment about any concerns you 
 might have relating to the LLC agreement.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay

 The attached MEH Risk Management Policy includes one additional revision to 
 yesterday's draft.  Please disregard yesterday's version.  This is the 
 version that should be reviewed for comments or questions.
