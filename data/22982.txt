 Mr. Derrick, I am sending this email to you at the request of Mr. James Bouillion.  I understand you are already aware of the above as a copy of the EEOC charge was provided to you by Ms. Michelle Hoogendam Cash, and as Mr. Bouillion wrote to you regarding same on May 10, 2001 when he first learned about it from Ms. Cash.
 
 Mr. Bouillion has consulted with our broker, and it is their recommendation that we formally place our carrier on "notice" of a "potential claim" situation as a "precautionary measure" to ensure that the reporting provisions of the insurance contract are met.  While the charge itself does not give rise to a "claim" under the policy, the broker feels that matters which involve the EEOC generally result in formal claims being pursued.  Thus, their recommendation to report to the carrier.
 
 Please advise if you would like for us to formally report this matter to the broker so that they can notice our carrier.  If so, please let us know whether you want us to disclose to Ms. Cash the potential for insurance coverage in the event a claim(s) result from the allegations.  Thanks,
