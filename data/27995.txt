 
 I enjoyed meeting with you guys and your team this morning.  Our crack 
 certificate people have already responded to my request, as you'll see 
 below.  As you get deeper into the process, talking with Michele and her 
 colleagues may be useful for you as they have been through it all before with 
 FERC on storage projects.  Let me know if I can be of further help.  Thanks 
 for the quick help, Michele.  DF

 Attached are a list of the exhibits for a certificate application and the 
 environmental requirements (this document is the redline for the new 
 environmental regulations under Order No. 603, 603A, & 603B). Within this 
 document is the minimum checklist requirements for the environmental report.  
 I included everything because ultimately we must provide everything --not 
 just the minimum.   If this is too much or not enough let me know.   Also, 
 the definition of an affected landowner on new or expansion of the boundaries 
 of an existing storage facility includes both surface and subsurface owners 
 for landowner notification requirements (such requirements are not included 
 in the attached documents).  thanks MW
 
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 

  
  
 Do we have anything off the shelf that we could send to some guys at ENA that 
 are trying to understand the 7(c) process?  They asked me for something like 
 a "checklist" of what you'd have to put in a cert. app. to build and operate 
 a new storage project.  Any ideas would be appreciated.  DF
