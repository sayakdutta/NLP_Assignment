    Monique,
 
    Sorry I haven't gotten back to you before now and I truly wish we
    could've
    gotten together over Memorial Day.  I was only in town a couple of days
    and
    then off to San Antonio so we just missed each other again.  Go a lot to
    catch up on and I am going to be tenacious in my attempts to get a hold
    of
    you...let me know when you have time to talk.  I am out this weekend but
    maybe tonight or next week, we can chat.  Let me know.
 
    Take care and stay safe.
