 Many of you that had an interest in E2/Endeavor probably heard yesterday that 
 FPL and Entergy agreed to merge.  This was a complete surprise to us, and 
 unfortunately kills our chances for creating a JV with FPL. We are looking at 
 other options, and I am confident that we will be back with another partner.
 
 Thanks for your time and help in this process.
 
 Regards,
 
 Don
