 It would be great if you could expedite the invoices.
 
 Thanks,

 I coded the King and Spalding invoices in IPAYIT yesterday. Before coding, I had to forward the invoices to Ben for his approval. So, they should be processed and paid soon through IPAYIT. 
 
 Thanks-

Will you please code the invoices as the following or return them to me.
