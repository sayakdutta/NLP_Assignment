 
 Your comments with respect to the Non-Disclosure Agreement have been forwarded on to me by Brandon Wax.  After reviewing them, we have agreed to most of your comments.  We have agreed to delete the arbitration provision but have retained the limitation of damages. Further, it is Enron corporate policy that the confidential information shall be limited to a term two years so we are unable to delete the final paragraph.  Please call me at (713) 853-3399 or Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel at (713) 345-8897 or email us and let us know if these changes meet with your approval.
