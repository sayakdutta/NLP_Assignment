 David will be spending a couple of weeks with us in Houston (October 9 - 20) 
 before he goes to London for a week.  It would be great if each of you could 
 set up a lunch or dinner with him while he's here.  He will be in EB3878C at 
 extension 5-3757, while he's here and his assistant will be Chaundra Woods at 
 extension 5-7621. 
 
 Thanks in advance for your assistnace in making David's stay here in Houston 
 enjoyable.
 
 Regards, 
 
 Alan
