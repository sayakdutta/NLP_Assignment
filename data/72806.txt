 
 Isabel,
 
 I'm waiting on Delta to give me language concerning a performance guarantee 
 adjustment for site conditions before turning the execution version.  
 
 The GE parent guaranty and LOC are in the all the earlier versions I sent, 
 and remain unchanged.  Please let me know if you don't have the earlier 
 versions.

 Do you know when we might receive a revised Turbine Contract?  The lenders
 would like to review the GE parent guarantee.
 Thank you
