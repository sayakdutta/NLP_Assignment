 
 It looks like Phase II of our construction project (over where Julia's office 
 used to be) will be finished on the 18th so she will be moving into her new 
 office that weekend.  I now have the plans for Phase III and it turns out 
 your office will be included in the construction area.  Phase III will 
 probably start on the 25th.  That could always slip but I wanted to give you 
 as much notice as possible.
 
 Hope you are all doing well.  Getting any sleep yet?
