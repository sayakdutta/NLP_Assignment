 Mark - Louis Dreyfus Energy Services LP is signing their ISDA Master Agreement today and would like to get online to trade with EOL asap.  According to Jennifer McQuatde, they are currently trading physicals online and, she believes, have signed all the necessary docs.  Louis Dreyfus has asked if we would turn them on to trade OTC derivatives online based upon a fax of the signature page to their ISDA.  What is your view on this, oh mighty one?  Frank
