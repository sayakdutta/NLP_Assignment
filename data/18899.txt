 Kupiecki sent me an e-mail this morning about getting together for our
 project soon.  How does Tuesday at break sound?
 
 
     
 
 Sounds good to me!
 
 Do you want to try to read the case on our own and meet during the break on
 Tuesday to discuss?
 
 Let me know what you think!

 Hi Kelly,
 
 What do you think about the idea of getting our group together to talk 
 about the finance project soon?  If we wait too long, it will sneak up on
 us.
 
 Cheers,
