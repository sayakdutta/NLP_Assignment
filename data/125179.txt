 
 The stream of internet bullshit is never-ending.
 If the FBI had ANY concern about this, we would see it on the news.
 
 But I heard from a friend's friend that the Taliban hates atheists (like
 myself) most of all, and believes that if you give them lots of money they 
 will destroy themselves in an orgy of hookers and cocaine - because they are 
 immoral, Godless creatures. If you don't do as they say, they will blow up 
 your house on the 10th day of the 10th month of this year (like Nostradamus predicted). 
 Checks or cash (or hookers) can be sent to:
 2300 W Alabama  Apt 6
 Houston, TX 77098
