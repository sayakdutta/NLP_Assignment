 
 Mark,
 
 Two points. 
 
 1. You probably know about it already.  ABHAY MEHTA, the author of "Power 
 Play", is on a
 tour of the United States. Please, take a look at the information about a 
 meeting last Sunday 
 at Stanford University. The web site address is  given below. My wife went to
 the presentation and told me it was quite critical about Enron. About 40 
 people attended.
 
 2. I was approached by John Martin, a professor of finance at Baylor, to 
 write jointly an
 academic paper on Enron for a financial journal. He wanted to work on an 
 article on EBS.
 I have suggested a different topic: Enron - Case Study of a Company 
 Reinventing Itself.
 
 I made a few points to John:
 
 a. Enron's evolution did not just happen  by accident.
 It was a result of implementation of a far-reaching
 strategy developed by the management.
 
 b. In the process of its evolution Enron changed its environment. I came up 
 with a term
 "proactive evolution", as opposed to "reactive evolution."
 
 c. The strategy included many elements, including emphasis on the quality
 of human resources, changing corporate attitudes to risk taking and employee
 empowerment.
 
 d. There are very few companies that match Enron's experience and 
 accomplishemnts.
 
 The paper could become a standard reading at the MBA courses on corporate 
 strategy
 and would help greatly our recruiting efforts. 
 
 
 Writing the paper would require interviews with Ken, Jeff and a few other key 
 players. 
 Let me know what you thing about it. John is really excited about this paper.
 
 Vince
