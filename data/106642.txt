 Sara, 
 
 As way of background, ENA faxed a revised draft of the proposed ISDA Master 
 Agreement to EDEN on December 8th.  EDEN apparently still does not want to 
 render an opinion of "outside counsel".  Following-up on the messages from 
 Rodolfo Freyre and Jeff Kabel, have you spoken to either Jeff or Rolo 
 regarding EDEN's not wanting to sign an opinion of "outside counsel" in 
 connection with the ISDA Master Agreement.  Has a decision been made with 
 regard to ENA's position on such matter?   
 
 As for Jeff's quiry, ENA does not have an executed ISDA Master Agreement with 
 AES Corp.
 
 Let me know if I can be of assistance.   Thanks.
