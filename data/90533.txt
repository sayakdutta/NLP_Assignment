 Everyone -
 
 Jay has prepared his organizational changes as they relate to East Tariffs.  He mentioned that he is allowing fopr ScottStoness to focus on the West with Steve Swain.
 
 Should we go ahead and make a formal break between East (Jay reporting to me) and West (Swain reporting to Don) so that everyone is clear?  I think we could roll all of this out at once.
 
 Thanks,
 Rogers
