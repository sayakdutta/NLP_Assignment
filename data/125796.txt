 BTW, I think I have a bye on this video.
 
  
     
 sorry guys - I didnt really read this the first time. I thought it was regarding the video for the management conference (which they also are short volunteers for). Please disregard and I will find out what the attached is about.
 
 Sorry for the confusion, rob. 
 
  
     
 Guys - any volunteers or should we "draw straws"

 We have unsuccessfully attempted to find sponsors for the project list you gave to me in our meeting.  I would therefore like to start the game again but starting from zero and working our way up. Assuming we are starting with no budget for IT development, please could you sit down with each of our Business Sponsors and agree a number with them.  They are:
 
 Tim Belden (or his appointed person) for West Power
 Lloyd Will for East Power
 Geof Storey for Gas 
 Laura Luce for Peoples and Global Net
 Chris Gaskill for Gas Fundys
 Rob Milnthorp (or his appointed person) for Canada.
 Mark Haedicke/Greenberg (or his appointed person) for Legal.
 
 Each of the above will be allocated their charge for IT development and capital (apart from Geof who will allocate across the desks) and therefore is the best person/people to decide on the costs.  Please could you arrange a short meeting/discussion with each and agree a budget as the process so far is not working.
 
 I am assuming its zero at the moment.
 
 
 Thanks
 
 Louise
