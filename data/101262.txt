Either shoot me an email or I'll give you a call a little later this afternoon.  I don't think I have you work number anymore though, so if you wouldn't mind giving that to me again that would be great.
 
 See ya later,
 Susan

 So... tomorrow night?  You, me Mucky Duck???  Whatever is good... we can go
 for a little while or whatever.  Do you know how much it costs? I am
 flexible... live music with a drink or two and good conversation sounds
 pretty darn good...
 
 Let me know and I will talk to you soon... AND if this doesn't work out for
 some reason... no worries and we will re-schedule soon!
