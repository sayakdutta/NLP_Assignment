 I spoke with Jim Danielson at MWD regarding this cut on 11/26. We did not deliver the 25 mws to MWD. Jim at MWD requested that we "book out" the cut with him at the contract price of the 25 mws. I entered a deal to buy 25 mws from MWD at the contract price ($113.00) deal #882054, and a deal to sell to Calpine to capture LD's ($113.00) deal #882064. I attempted to enter this in the cuts database but got several errors and do not have confidence that this occurred. Please let me know if you have any questions.
