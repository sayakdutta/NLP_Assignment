 in the deal after sell down.

 Here is a copy of the agreement, made all the more ugly by my redaction 
 "surgery."
 
 I have put some terms that you will want to think through carefully in 
 italics.  I totally removed some other provisions that were particularly 
 deal-specific (e.g. an obligation to offer to sell them the project if we 
 decided to abandon it--I know, it's damn weird, but they were hung up on some 
 strange things).
 
 Let me know if I can answer any questions.
 
 
  
     
 Thanks!
