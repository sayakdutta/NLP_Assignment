 
 Tom:
 
 I'm trying to finalize the ISDA Master Agreement with these guys.  We have 
 one issue:
 
 If there is a long-term market disruption event (i.e. over 3 days), and we 
 have no fallback price, then we negotiate a price and ENA would normally 
 obtain 2 quotes and average them.  Our position is that we prefer to obtain 
 the quotes because if a disruption were to occur, we would obtain quotes for 
 hundreds of deals in the same manner (because our agreements will all have 
 the same provisions) and it is possible that 4 quotes may not be available.
 
 NYSEG would like for each of ENA and NYSEG to obtain 2 quotes and then 
 average the 4 quotes.
 
 Are you agreeable to this?
 
 Sara
