 Hi John,
 
 I hope your gas markets are moving nicely this week.  Its
 been a long time since we talked, but a lot has happened.
 But the most important thing has been my decision to join
 Enron. At this point, I am looking around for a rotation,
 and I have received a lot of advice pointing me towards
 Gas/Power Structuring and RAC rotations.  I am wondering if
 you know some people in these areas who might be looking
 for analysts.  I have heard that traders work closely with
 the structured finance and RAC guys, true?  If you have
 time please let me know if you know of anything.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Adam Bayer
