 Tim Smith said you  had a form of confidentiality agreement you had sent to 
 him.  We have  taken the time to prepare and provide you a confidentiality 
 agreement which  contains substantive provisions that have already been 
 reviewed by your counsel  in our other dealings.  Many of the provisions are 
 very similar both  agreements.  Therefore, please have your counsel review 
 that document as  soon as possible.
