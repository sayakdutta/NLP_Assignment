 Makes sense to me.

 Just a quick email to start some  discussion about the panel session you are 
 involved in during Risk2000 in Boston  on 13 & 14 June.
 ?
 Although I would welcome suggestions to the contrary, I would  prefer to go 
 straight into the discussion rather than have a series of short  
 presentations first. Ideally I think we should establish a number of topic 
 areas  around which the moderator can lead the discussion - naturally for the 
 better  discussions it's important to have varying views on similar subjects; 
 similarly  it is often interesting to hear the panel's comments on one 
 individual's more  specific area of knowledge.
 ?
 Conseqently if you could return this email (to all panel  members) with 
 topics you feel should be covered, any particular areas you would  personally 
 like to focus on, any proposed changes to the actual panel structure,  and 
 possibly additonal panel members you think should be there, that would be a  
 good start. I am still in the process of looking for a moderator and if 
 anyone  has any suggestions, please let me know.

 (The talk title is Effectively Applying Weather  Derivatives)

 Best regards,
