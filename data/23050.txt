 
 Gentlemen, I have just returned from almost two weeks in London (in connection with one of our mattters that was being heard by 5 of the Law Lords of the House of Lords) and found your message. I will coordinate travel plans with Bobby.  I am very honored to be included in this most memorable event. All the best.  Jim

 Here is the proposed plan. Jim and Bobby should come over to Atlanta as
 early as convenient on May 14. Lunch, maybe a few people who want to talk to
 Jim, etc. We'll leave here to drive over (2 1/4 hours) to arrive about 6
 p.m. for drinks and dinner.
 Spend the night, play the next day, drive  back. Jim and  Bobby should let
 us know what your return schedule to Houston would be, but later is better
 so no one feels rushed.
 	This should be great!
