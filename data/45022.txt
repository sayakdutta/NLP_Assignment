 
 I just wanted to give you an update on the NDA for the referenced 
 counterparty.  I faxed your signed draft to Andrew Hausman this morning.  He 
 finally got back to me a few minutes ago to let me know that he's looking for 
 a lawyer on his side to review it.  He has one comments already I'll run by 
 Mark.  Otherwise, we're waiting for him to get back with his lawyer's 
 comments.
