 quit flattering yourself.  it was a male looking at you and he told me!  how do you feel about that?
 
  
     
 stop lying, you dont have to be embarrased, I understand
 
  
     
 then i guess it is a fact that a male was staring at you.  
 
 
 
 i am laughing so hard!!!! :)
 
  
     
 I wasnt accusing you I was just stating a fact
 
  
     
 i can't tell because then you would acuse them of staring at you too.  
 
  
     
 no I dont know how it works, and who told you
 
  
     
 don't you have messenger
 
 
  
     
 nobody told you, dont lie
