 
 Dana,
 
 Hello from Tokyo.  I sent you a reply and forwarded your resume to our HR 
 group.  I don't know if you got my reply the day I received your resume.  I 
 have had a lot of people tell me that they didn't get a response from me 
 about the same time as you contacted me.  My sent mail doesn't list you as a 
 completed return email.   
 
 I hope all is well.
 
 Mike
