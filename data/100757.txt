 FYI. In general everything went ok today Nov 10.
 
 Susan Scott had some problems with some of the excel spreadsheets she's been 
 running on her machine. The issue here is that the CopyFromRecordset method 
 of a range object is failing. The simple
 fix is to use a user defined function named rsOutput instead of the method. 
 She also mentioned that a process that outputs a text file to the E: drive 
 seems to be failing on her machine but is working fine on Dutch Quigley's 
 machine. She'll provide more detail to support on Monday.
 
 Cheers.
