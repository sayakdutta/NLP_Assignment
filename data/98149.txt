 Laura:
 
 As discussed, attached are materials gathered in-house as to ERCOT Summer 
 1999 price movements, consisting of (i) a chart of high and low ERCOT B 
 product prices for each trading day of the summer, as published in MegaWatt 
 Daily, and (ii) articles from the Megawatt Daily indicating unusual price 
 movements in the same period.  Our "InfoCentral" employee has indicated as to 
 the latter that articles published on August 2, 3, 16, 17 and 19, 1999 made 
 reference to "next summer", and may thus on their face be indicative of 
 altered forward price curves.  Please contact me with any questions or 
 comments.
