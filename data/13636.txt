 
 Cathy,
 
 I have been getting this question a lot!
 
 It has been communicated to every employee that if they are in Category 5, they will get a PIP.  Therefore, I recommend putting one in place.  If you are more comfortable, you can re-name it to reflect goals and objectives for the next review period -- something like "Performance Objectives" or something to that effect. 
 
 Because it has been communicated that everyone will get a plan, we really should follow through.

 Hi Michelle,
 
 For those employees that landed in Category 5 due to misclassification of job group, is it sufficient to address in the evaluation and not complete a PIP?  The employee is by no means performing poorly and presenting her with a PIP would be a contradicting message.
 
 Through the process of the PRC, we identified that this particular person who is a Specialist was really doing an Entry Specialist job and would have faired fairly well in the lower job group, however because we had them in the Specialist job group, she did not fair so well relative to her Specialist peers.
 
 Just want to make sure I'm not breaking any policy by making this exception.
 
 Thanks,
 Cathy
