 Anthony is with the Global Contracts Group.  Can you coordinate with him the 
 exact head count as we get closer.  Thanks!

 Tana,
 
 The Date looks good for everyone (those that have responded) I have been 
 waiting to hear back from all of the invitees.  I will be in touch about the 
 exact head count whenever I receive responses.
 
 Sorry for the delay,
 Anthony
 
 
 
     
 Anthony,
 
 You never got back to me on whether this date was good and the total head 
 count.  Can youu please confirm this.  Thanks.

 Carol St. Clair had her assistant reserve EB46C1 on May 24 from 11:30 -2:00 
 for our luncheon.  Can you please confirm that that date is good for your 
 group and also the total head count.  Suzanne will take care of ordering 
 lunch for us.
 
 Thanks!
