 I thought some of you might like to see the following press quote, which was 
 taken from a UK daily natural gas publication today. It nicely sums up 
 EnronOnline:
 
 "A new web based trading service drew significant levels of interest......One 
 trader says he did "50 or 60 deals on EnronOnline.  "There's nothing 
 fundamentally better about the form of trading", he says, "but they're always 
 there, they're firm, and they don't go into a meeting for an hour."" -
