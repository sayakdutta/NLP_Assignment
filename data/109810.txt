 
 Mr. Compton,
 
 This meeting is most definitely on. My apologies if there has been any doubt 
 on your part; however, Jeff has been traveling about 90% of the time since 
 mid-February, which has put us a bit behind schedule.  I will be in touch 
 with you soon to schedule a phone call with Jeff.
 
 Regard,
 Sherri Sera
