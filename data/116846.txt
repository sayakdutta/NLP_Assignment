 
 Jack Wells is the contact for both - I've added his name to deal #507417. 
 According to Sean Crandall, these deals are separate from 347356. That deal 
 was a sale, and the deals entered today are all buys. Sean said we're just 
 buying back the MW we originally sold them. But I think that's the only 
 connection. Let me know if you need more of an explanation from the traders, 
 but our take is that these deals are separate.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
   
  
 Are these two deals part of the original Conoco deal # 347356 that they are 
 extending or something different?  We need to know because we have to add 
 something in the confirmation if they are extensions of the original deal.  
 Also, is Jack Wells the contact for both?
 
 Thanks!
