 I am meeting with Susan Musch (APACHI's tax expert) and we will get back to 
 you on the tax issues. Immediately I can tell you that back to back deals 
 (with no spread) will not work. This raises transfer pricing issues. If the 
 deal is SocGen on Melbourne temperatures, why is the counterparty not SocGen 
 Aust? Is the deal pure trading, or is it being done to hedge a real exposure 
 for Soc Gen. If the deal is being treated in any way as 'insurance' there can 
 be issues with the cross border nature. 
 
 I am in 2014 in 3AC if you are around and want to chat about it tonight.
 
 Heidi

 Dear David,
 
 We are about to do a weather trade with SocGen or Aquila on Melbourne 
 temperature
 Expected trade date is Thursday - 13 April.
 Steven Vu, Head Weather trader in Houston will transact with above thru a 
 broker in US.
 
 Premium approx 700k AUD.
 
 
 What is the best way in terms of regulations and tax - assume limits in place 
 !
 Houston is to take a  portion of the deal too.
 
 (a) ENA trades with SG USA, then back to back transact between ENA & En Aust ?
 
 (b) ENA trades with SG USA, then gives p&L to  En Aust ?
 can this P&L be real income or shadow only ?
 
 (c) En Aust trades with SG Usa ( thru Oz arm of US broker or thru US broker)
 
 or any other suggestions ???
 
 Pls revert :o)
 Thx,  Raymond
