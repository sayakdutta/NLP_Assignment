 
 ME TOO...BUT WE WOULDN'T BE WATCHING THE GAME!  WHERE SHOULD WE STAY?  RUDY IS COMING UP ON SATURDAY AND I'M LEAVING ON SUNDAY MORNING!
 
 
     
 
 Sometimes. I'm supposed to turn it off, but messages usually store until I turn it on. I land around 2:30 and have a two hour drive after that. 
 
 Are you going to the game?  I am soooo jealous. Wish I could go with you...
