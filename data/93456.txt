 
 It's official.  I'm going to start up there March 12th.  As for a place to 
 live, I'll probably make a quick trip up there sometime next week to look at 
 apartments.

 The sooner the better.  Do you have a place to live yet?  
 
 Let me know when its official, so I can tell the group you're coming.

 Hey Richard,
 
 I think we've finally gotten an answer out of the analyst program.  I'm just 
 waiting on the paper work now.  I spoke to Laura yesterday about a possible 
 March 12th start date.  Let me know if that date's okay for you.  
 
 I'll let you know if anything changes.

 What's going on?  I haven't heard from you in awhile.  Laura indicated to me 
 that she was able to do something with the analyst program to hopefully solve 
 your cost of living issue.  We would still love to have you in Chicago.  Let 
 me know what you are thinking.
 
 You may have told Laura, but I haven't spoken to her much in the last couple 
 of weeks and we were all wondering up here in Chicago.
