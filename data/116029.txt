 
 I've ordered the 1999 Annual Report for Scottish Power, as I noticed it was 
 not in the company file. It should be here tomorrow or Friday at the latest. 
 If you need the information sooner than that, I can download the report from 
 the company's website, although the document is understandably bulky. Please 
 let me know if you'd like a print-out.
 
 Also, if you'd like, I can talk to Sue about CASA's financial needs. Mollie 
 and I had discussed splitting the auction proceeds between two charities; in 
 that way we can share the wealth and not inundate an organization with more 
 than they can manage. It's something to think about in case CASA doesn't need 
 much help.
