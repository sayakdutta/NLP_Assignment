 	I have now spent 16 hours on the valuation project and wanted to touch
 base with you to make sure that the basic approach makes sense and that you
 think we are making an appropriate amount of progress.  My invoice is
 attached.
 
 	By the way, John Martin just mentioned that you have agreed to be our
 luncheon speaker at the Texas Finance Festival.  I really appreciate your
 help on this and would like to schedule some time next week to talk about
 it in more detail.
 
 	I look forward to hearing from you.
 
 regards,
 
 Sheridan
