 Dear Ms.Feldman,
 Please receive all my apologies for not having
 answered earlier your 2 emails,but I was in the
 States for 6 weeks and could not access my
 Dauphine email.In any case,the time was
 fruitfully used by my associates and myself to
 improve the "robustness" of the product,from
 a computer and mathematical standpoint.
 Regarding your 3 points
 1.We agree on the price of 90,000 USD
 2.D-G will provide system support:we can do so
 by emailing anther version of the software,being
 available on the phone and by email but we
 cannot promise unlimited support of all kinds
 without risking bankruptcy right away.
 Moreover,the $ 90,000 may be paid in 3 fractions
 and your risk would be quite minimal
 3.Regarding the escrow,we have been using so
 far a small law firm with 5 partners(none of my
 family) in Amherst:Hart,Reed,Brown,Golowich
 and Kaplan.But we are not closed to anther
 solution you would strongly prefer.
 Best regards
