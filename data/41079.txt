 				Rod I do not have Kelly Boots e-mail address and am traveling today without a phone directory... but I wanted to share or at least ask that we treat Standard Chartered real nice as we go through this crisis.  These guys are stepping up for us in every way....they (along with ING) are 100% behind us and are putting their money on it.  Also BNP Pays Bas is having an awful time with their credit committee...the business people have approved this and do not feel that Enron's problem effects us but the credit committee is not so forgiving.  If Kelly or anyone can do anything to help Paysbas in this situation it would be greatly appreciated.   My account executive there is Lincoln Payton and Marci Weiss...
 
 				Would you be so kind as to pass this along to Kelly or anyone else that you feel appropriate?
