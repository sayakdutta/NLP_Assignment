 Thank you for your recent call.  I understand from Laurel Adams that we are unable to reconcile the FRA's due to insufficient detail.  For those trades, can you please send additional detail such as a fixed rate or trade date?  You can contact Laurel directly if you have any questions (713-853-7035).
 
 Regards.  Sara
