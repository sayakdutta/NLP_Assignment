 figure when and where I'm taking vacation.   Puerto Rico is right up there, 
 buddy, so what's the latest on the whole contract extension?  I checked some 
 airfares a couple of weeks ago and, WOW, it was a bit high, which is why I 
 didn't jump right on this.  I'll do some checking tonight, and I'll let you 
 know what I come up with.  Ideally, mid to end of February is best, but of 
 course, that all depends on if you're still going to be there. Anyway,  I 
 just wanted to let you know, I'm still considering.
