 think you should make a stab at getting Mike Kahn, Chair of the California 
 Electricity Oversight Board on one of the panels.  I can make a contact and I 
 don't think that it's too late to try.  He'd be very good.  Very close to the 
 governor.

 Dear Jeff,
 
 Can you please send me a brief biographical sketch, one that will be 
 suitable for posting onthe conference website and also for conference 
 introductions by the Moderator of your panel, Professor Howard Shekanski?
 
 Thanks very much.
 Best wishes,
 Heather
