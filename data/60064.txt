 I am currently working with Enron Global Markets.  I am very interest in pursing my career in the energy market as a Sr. Admin within Enron's reorganization.  I worked in the Crude trading group on the 3rd floor of Enron Center South.  I have been with Enron for ten years and the majority of those years have been with the trading environment.
 
 I understand that the new company will consist of most of the employees currently in gas and power, but if you find that you will be in need of additional help, please consider me as a candidate.  If you would like for me to send you my resume please let me know.  I would love to work for your organization.
