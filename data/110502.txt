 
 Well it's good to hear from you.  I'm glad the skiing was good.  I'm jealous, 
 although I'm going to NY this weekend, and I'm trying to set up a day of 
 skiing!  
 
 I haven't reserved the place yet, but as of yesterday it was still 
 available.  I was suprised to get mail from Duncan yesterday...then I 
 realized it was a check...cool.  So, when do you think the rest will be on 
 the way.  Once I know, I'll go ahead and get the place.  Give me a call, 
 though.  I'll try you today if I don't hear from you first.  I'm leaving for 
 NY tomorrow morning, but I'll have my phone all weekend.
 
 Stay cool.
 
 Mateo.
