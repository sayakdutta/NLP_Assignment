 
 Sorry I have been less than diligent in getting back to you, although I tried to call today. As David Burns may have told you, I was active at first(when I thought my role as comm. member was limted) I have not been active lately because almost all the lawyers involved in this case seem to only motivated to prolong the case.There is alot of money being spent on nothing. Now I see this Budget. Unbelievable. I am available tomorrow aft. please have your asst. call Twanda Sweet 853-9402 to set it up. Have you talked to anyone else?
 
  

  
 I would like to try and schedule a convenient time to discuss with you the
 role/scope of the PX Participants Committee.  Reliant has been concerned
 for some time about the continued life line of the PX and this committee
 and the additional layer of expenses that are being incurred (see BDO's
 recent analysis of the PX budget for example).  It seems to me that the
 sole role of the PX and the committee (other than with respect to
 litigation that has already commenced such as the commandeering litigation)
 aught to be limited to (i) record/data retention and (ii) finalizing
 accounting issues so that each participant has a certification of how much
 it is owed by each defaulting IOU.  The PX seems to have lost its "pass
 through" nature, which is critical to each participant being able to asset
 its claims directly.   I am particularly concerned that the committee,
 through its professionals is beginning to have a life of its own.
 
 It would be useful to have this discussion prior to the committee meeting
 tomorrow afternoon.  Are you available after 10 a.m. central time tomorrow
 to discuss?
