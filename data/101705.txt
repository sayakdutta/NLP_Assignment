 
 hey mo....how's it going?
 
 hope you had a good day at work today, mine was boring as usual.  just wanted to let you know that i thought i might try to give you a call tonight and fill you in on my plans for seattle.  i really feel like i have no idea how this whole thing will pan out, and i'm getting more nervous as friday approaches.  oh well, c'est la vie right?
 
 i've been trying to freshen up on things and be a little more on top of my game...but it's tough.
 
 i've agreed to be out of my apt. by the end of the day Monday...saves me about $250, but then the commute starts...yuck!!!!!!!!!!!!
 
 talk to you later,
 Susan
