 Corp. address book?  Tanya and Rod can be accessed through the ECT 
 directory!  I spoke with David Mitchell this morning.  He will prepare a 
 short memo summarizing our recent discussion (NYMEX), probably by the end of 
 this week or early next week.  Then we can decide whether additional 
 conversations are necessary and how to proceed in general.  Also, please send 
 credit worksheets to BOTH Susan Bailey and Susan Flynn.  They divide up the 
 booty.  We have a new paralegal starting on Monday named Samantha Boyd.  She 
 will eventually be thrown into the fray.  We'll be sending a new message to 
 everyone in credit soon.  Thanks for your help.  Sara
