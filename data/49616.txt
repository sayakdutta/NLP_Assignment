 
 Cindy,
 
 I got a copy of the book and another one is on the way from our officer in 
 India.
 I can lend you the book and you can makes copies of the most important 
 chapters.
 I don't think we should be buying too many copies and increasing the sales of 
 the book.
 
 In general, I think that we should counter the presentations made by Mr. 
 Mehta. The person in charge of
 our Dhabol operation is a Stanford graduate and maybe he could obtain an 
 invitation
 to speak at the same forum  and present the facts as they are. He should be 
 here for the management 
 conference.

 Good afternoon Vince,
 
 Christie Patrick mentioned to me the conference that your wife recently 
 attended at Stanford.  At this coference Abahy Mehta discussed his/her 
 recently published book 'Power Play' - that certainly does NOT flatter 
 Enron.  I have conducted a search on Amazon.com, Britannica.com and Dow Jones 
 and I am coming up empty handed.  Would you be kind enough to briefly trouble 
 your wife to provide any other information she may remember, so I can narrow 
 my search.
 
 I greatly appreciate it.
 
 Regards,
 
 Cindy
