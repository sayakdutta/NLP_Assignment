 As we discussed last week, we are in the process of scheduling lunch seminars 
 with credit, confirms/settlements and global contracts for the following 
 dates:
 
 May 5th, 12th and 24th.
 
 Please let Sara and I know ASAP if you plan to be out onh any of these dates 
 as we feel that it is very important that you attend.
 
 Tana:
 Have you talked to the Global Contracts Group about the 24th?
