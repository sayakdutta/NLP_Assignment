 Hey there Sara!  I'm back from Pittsburgh and Indy and would love to get 
 together with you for lunch.  I'm free on Wednesday and Friday.  Let me know 
 if either of these dates work for you.  Otherwise, we will probably have to 
 wait until November since bid week is right around the corner!  Hope you had 
 a nice weekend.  Happy Monday!
