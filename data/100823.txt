 
 Those were great Chris.  Sorry no emails sooner to tell you all of my trip to 
 London, which was incredible, but alas I am back at work and therefore 
 swamped.  Mom said you guys had a great time in China.  I hope you took lots 
 of pictures.  I'm not sure if she already passed along the bad news, but it 
 doesn't look like I'm going to be able to visit next month...Work strikes 
 again.  I am very frustrated (considering I asked for this time off 4 mos. 
 ago) but there isn't really anything I can do.  So, I'm going to see if 
 there's a way I could come over next spring.  Regardless, I very excited 
 about you and Chuck coming back to Houston in December and we'll just have to 
 make up some quality time then.
 
 Talk to you soon,
 Susan
 
 PS - Isn't it ironic...Now Ben keeps calling wanting to go out.  I mean 
 honestly what goes through these guys heads.  They don't realize a "good 
 thing" the first time around and the second time around is too late - the 
 "good thing" is no longer interested.
