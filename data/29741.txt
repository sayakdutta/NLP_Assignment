 Best of Luck - Rice is a good school.
 
 

 
   
  
 Rob,
 
 Last Friday, I learned from an Enron employee who is currently enrolled in 
 the Rice's EMBA program that I had great chance to get admitted to the 
 program. So I decided not to apply to Yale. If you haven't started working on 
 the recommendation letter, please discard it. I appreciate your previous help 
 and will keep you posted.
 
 Thanks again.
 
 
 Blanca,  Thank you very much for your help in the process.
 
 
 Maggie
