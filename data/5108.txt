 Those numbers are all inclusive for the wellhead portfolio.  Sharp's number 
 is embedded within those.  His number is estimated at approx $170,000/mo.  
 I will follow up with these specific details.

 Eric, 
 
 Per Greg Sharp, he and Tom Martin discussed the Wellhead Accrual Income 
 numbers today, and Effective Q1 2000, Greg will begin recognizing this 
 accrual income in his financials.  
 
 It is my understanding that the new Wellhead Portfolio in Sitara assists you 
 in calculating this monthly number (which is estimated at $170,000 per 
 month).  Could you please provide the detail behind this calculation, or if 
 this data is pulled directly from Sitara, George and I could meet with you to 
 become familiar with this data extraction process. 
 
 Thank you, 
 Melissa
