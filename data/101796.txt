 
 Bonnie....How was the weekend??????  Very curious to see what you crazy girls did up there in Whistler.  
 
 So, I wanted to let you know that Puget called me last Friday with another job opening.  I'm supposed to talk to the guy today regarding the position.  I certainly don't want to get my hopes up...but I'm kind of excited about this being something I could actually like.  
 
 Hope all is well with you and I'll let you know how my phone call goes today.
 
 Talk to you soon,
 Susan
 
 Btw...messengered with Matt yesterday, I guess things are back to "normal" - whatever that is.
 
  
     
 
 
 hi there:
 how are you doing? have you told the company anything yet? i am thinking you probably had to turn ole pattie down... was she devestated that you won't be her new BFF?
 
 let me know how it went, and i hope things are going well on the whole "looking for a job" front. I know it can be so frustrating.
 
 have you spoken with matt????  any more updates with that?
 
 happy valentines (even though it is a dumb holiday)
 
 Take care
 bonnie
