 I'm still here.  I saw where they got the QB from Madison as well.  Maybe we can get together for lunch early next week.  Let me know.

 Hope everything is going okay for you.    UT is bringing in possible the
 greatest recruiting class in history.   Let me know what's going on.  Let's
 get together soon.
