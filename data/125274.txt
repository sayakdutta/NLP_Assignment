 Transwestern Pipeline Company consents to disclosure of the discount rate for FTS-1 Agreement No. 27606 to the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission. For our files, please FAX a copy of the Confidentiality Agreement between PNM and the NMPRC to me at (713) 646-4095.

 Each year PNM is required to present its Winter Supply Plan to the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission.  Part of that presentation will be the disclosure of PNM's new firm transportation agreement with Transwestern, including the discount rate.  PNM has secured a Confidentiality Agreement with the NMPRC.  Please confirm Transwestern's consent to such disclosure as soon as possible.
