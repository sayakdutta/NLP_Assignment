 
 A couple of other ideas of things we might ask for (in addition to pulling this without comment from anywhere it is posted and committing to decline any representation against us in these matters):
 
 1.  How many (who?) have responded to this?  Shouldn't we have the opportunity to clear the conflict?
 2.  Commit to not give advice on any similar matter without inquiring as to the party on the other side (i.e. no "no-names" advice on these issues).
