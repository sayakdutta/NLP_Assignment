 of all pleadings and drafts of any important pleadings--answers, 
 counterclaims or motions for summary judgement--before they are filed. As for 
 contact with the ECP people, I think your litigators can call them directly 
 for incidental information. Any strategy calls should be made through me. I 
 would suggest that they give me the option of participating on the initial 
 calls w/ the ECP witnesses. I wil;l likely decline because of time 
 constraints. Is that as clear as mud?

 Richard:  Could you let me know at your convenience if you should be the 
 contact person for any LeBoeuf lawyer with respect to any correspondence, 
 papers, questions, etc. in this matter.  Do you want us to be sending any 
 drafts of court papers that we prepare, for example, to ECP simultaneously 
 with sending them to you or after you have reviewed them?  I assume our 
 litigators can contact the ECP folks directly to obtain any information or 
 other materials that they may need, but please let me know if you would 
 rather that they work through you.  Thanks, Richard.  I hope that all is 
 going well.  John
