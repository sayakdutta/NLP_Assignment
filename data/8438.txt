 
 Can you please provide the following information on invitees to the series of breakfast meetings:
 (example noted below from today's meeting)
 
 Name			Title		Group 				Direct Supervisor
 
 
 Jeff Gossett		Director		Operations - Gas Risk (EA)	Bob Hall 
 
 La Metrice Dopson	Sr. Director	IT Infrastructure			Jenny Rub 
 
 
 
 Mark, Greg and I need to have this information the day before the scheduled breakfast meeting.  The group description may be the most difficult to get, but you can look at this as a good way for you to get to know the leadership team within ENW and what they do.  I will be glad to help you with the details - just let me know.   Noting each employee's direct supervisor will just make it that much easier for us to understand where everyone fits into the organization.  
 
 I would also like to have this information for the breakfast meeting that was held this morning.  Thanks.

 Can I also take a look at the total list of employees that will be invited to the breakfast meetings?  The list that I used last week for Senior Directors and above for the Tuesday lunch meeting was not completely up-to-date.  I just want to be sure that we are not leaving anyone out.  Thanks.
