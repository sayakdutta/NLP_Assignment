 
 Donna,
 
 My preference is to come to the campus.
 I shall check with Christie and Jeff regarding their availability.

 Tiger Team Hosts:
 
 Happy New Year!  It is almost time for the students to return to school (Jan
 16) and begin spring semester classes (FAP).
 Before we know it, it will be time for the Mid-Project Review and I would
 like to schedule times with you now for planning purposes.  As part of your
 Host Responsibilities, there are several ways to accomplish the Mid-Project
 Reviews (see options). Generally, you should allow 2 hours, with each of the
 three teams presenting (20-30 min each) and Q & A's. The dates are below.
 Times will be listed, as well.  Times are dictated by the students class
 schedules and availability of space. I will schedule the Reviews on a
 first-come, first basis, so please contact me no later then Friday, Jan 26,
 2001.
 
 Options:
 
 1. You may come to campus.  If this is the case, please let me know as soon
 as possible.
 
 2. You may videoconference in for the presentation, should you have that
 capability.  Let me know the phone-in number.
 
 
 Please specify date and preferred time slot:
