 We are pleased to confirm today's launch of the following products via EOL:
 
 Ethylene Contract (NW Europe)
 Propylene Contract (NW Europe)
 HD Polyethylene (German Film)
 Polypropylene (German Inj)
 Polystyrene (German General Purpose)
 
 In a 2nd roll-out (timing TBC) we are looking to add:
 
 PVC (German Pipe)
 LD Polyethylene (German Film)
 LLD Polyethylene (German C4)
 
 We are initially offering 6 month and 12 month swaps for each product.
 
 SUMMATION OF EUROPEAN MKT
 
 - market is very conservative and tunnel-visioned, with derivatives as very 
 new concept to all players (case of tail trying to wag the dog)
 
 - even though no OTC trades have been done we are looking for the launch to 
 act as a magnet for potential counterparties to at least start looking at our 
 numbers on a regular basis (personalised letters + PR in industry mags is 
 underway).
 
 - Shell / BP are talking of launching similar platform 2001, but Enron only 
 company aggressively marketing in Europe (look at 
 http://www.eyeforchemicals.com/chem/presentations/hurley.pdf for Shell 
 perspective).
 
 - Enron brand is not known to converters/consumers  - profile awareness / 
 promotion is continuous process.
 
 - 6mo and 12mo prices are offered, as shorter term we are exposed due to the 
 fact we are not in physical mkt.
 
 - spreads are reasonably aggressive, but for hedging purposes all products 
 show close correlation to each other and US equivalents.
