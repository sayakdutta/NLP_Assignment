 Greg Whalley has informed me that Jim Fallon will now be in charge of East 
 Power, West Power, and Emissions Trading.  This means that my boss will now 
 be Jim Fallon rather than Greg Whalley.  I met with both Greg and Jim when I 
 was in Houston last week.  Greg was very complimentary of the work that we've 
 done here.  Greg has become extremely busy since his responsibilities have 
 expanded from North American trading to risk management worldwide.  
 Accordingly, he thought that it made the most sense to consolidate the power 
 trading functions in North America under one person.
 
 Jim was also very complimentary of our work.  We have been profitable for 6 
 straight quarters --  exceeded plan in 1998 and have exceeded plan in Q1 and 
 Q2 of 1999.  He wants to see this success continue.  Jim expects to spend at 
 least one day out of every two weeks up here.  I am looking forward to 
 working with Jim.  He has done an outstanding job running the east power 
 desk.  This should enable us to increase coordination between the two groups 
 and allow us to have a strong advocate in Houston.  While it's too early to 
 say anything definitively, I don't expect much to change on a day to day 
 basis here.  If anyone has any questions please don't hesitate to ask.
