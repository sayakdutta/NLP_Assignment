 
 I think the ranch was owned by Jimmy Powell.  It was 20 miles west of Menard 
 on Hwy 190.  A great area that's for sure.
 
 Three deer have been killed on the ranch thatI know of so far:
 
 1)  17", 10 point by Wayne Scroggins that grossed ~135 and is third largest 
 ever on ranch.  Didn't weigh it but they estimate it was 140-150 lbs.
 
 2) Mike Lehnert (Mickey's son ) killed an 17", 11 point with a double main 
 beam, four brow tines, and a drop tine.
 
 3) Travis shot a 16"  9 point that was pretty nice but had two broken points.
 
 We've seen more bucks than we have since '93.  More fawns than I ever 
 remember.  Maybe things have turned around for awhile.  I've got some good 
 videos I'll show sometime.  When are ya'll coming?
