 
 I think they are probably pricing calls vs. cancelling the project.
 
  
     
 They have begun construction for a couple of CT's (at least they have poured the concrete slab).  However, the 440MW is incorrect (I had pulled this from a list provided by Fundamentals).  It's closer to 200MW (per OPC).  
 
  
     
 Have they started construction?   Is the plant a peaker or combined cycle?
 
  
     
 FYI.  Oglethorpe (OPC) is inquiring about buying some daily calls for next May-Jul.  I'm already working with Harry/Steve, but thought you would like the reason for the request.  OPC is building a 440MW merchant plant scheduled to be online in June'02.  OPC is looking to buy these calls to hedge against a late online date (suggesting they have already sold at least some of this planned new generation).
