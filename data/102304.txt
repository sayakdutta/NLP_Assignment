 
 I've gotten a bit more educated about IT revenue crediting since you asked 
 your question yesterday.  "IT revenue crediting" is an industry term used to 
 describe a requirement (brought about either by a FERC order or a rate case 
 settlement) that IT revenues in excess of a certain dollar amount will be 
 credited back to all firm shippers in the next rate proceeding or thru some 
 refund mechanism.  Transwestern is currently not under any IT revenue 
 crediting obligation, and I would be very hesitant to negotiate any such 
 obligation with any individual shipper because then we would have to do the 
 same for all firm shippers on a nondiscriminatory basis. 
 
 If you need more info, let's talk.
