 
 Sorry it's been so hard.  Nothing meant by it.  To where are you moving?
 
 
 
 


    
 
 Hey Jeff.  You're a tough date.  Call me when you have time to go out--lunch
 or drinks.  I am moving from Houston next week, so hopefully it can be soon.
 Just wanted to catch up with you.  Could also use your advice on possible
 opportunities out there.
 
 Thanks,
 Barry
