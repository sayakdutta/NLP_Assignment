 
 Hey Eva,
 
 Got your message, was waiting for you to write more.  I'll have to check with 
 Sandra, but I haven't heard her say if she got your postcards.  
 
 Robin came back from her honeymoon and you can't tell when she's blushing 
 she's so red.  
 
 The last two AGA's have been great.  One was a 40 cent move and the other was 
 20 cents (what's better than Wednesdays?).
 
 That's it for now.
 
 Must go see Suey.
