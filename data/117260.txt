 Mark, 
 
 I will be back in Houston this weekend, so I wanted to check with you for a 
 time to come meet you and the other people next week.? Right now my schedule 
 is wide open so let me know a time that is convenient for you.
 
 Sorry if you have left any messages on my cell phone.? Estes Park is outside 
 the Sprint PCS network range so my phone does not work here.
 
 I look forward to hearing from you.
