 Brian,
 
 As we discussed the other day, there are several key commercial, logistics, risk management and gas control personnel that we must have to run our business this winter.  I have heard that some of our people are being pursued by outside companies in light of the potential HPL sale.  The key people that we want to ensure stay around through the transition are:
 
 Ed Gottlob
 Elsa Villareal
 James McKay
 Gary Hanks
 Darren Farmer
 Stacey Neuweiler
 Pat Clines
 Dave Baumbach
 O' Neal Winfree
 
 
 Let me know what you think.
 
 Tom
