 Can you please forward a copy of the ECI resolution(s) (or consent) which was 
 used to establish the Bear account and Securites Loan Agreement?  We need to 
 determine all products authorized for ECI trading.  Also, copies of Enron 
 Credit Limited authorizations would be useful.  Thanks for your help.
