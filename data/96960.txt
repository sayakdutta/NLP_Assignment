 Ed,
 
 I am going to assign the EPMI gty. below to Leslie as she has had a working relationship with Reliant in the past.  Did you also send this on to the other Enron entities that need to review their guarantees?

 We recently recieved notices regarding the cancellation of the Reliant Energy Resources Corp. guarantees.  Attached is the proposed form of replacement.  Please review as soon as possible.  I will be preparing new credit for the EEI and will provide to you next week.

 Attached below are the new Gty drafts that Reliant is proposing to us.  Please forward the appropriate draft to the responsible attorney for comments and approval to get this process started.   Most of the gty's that we currently have will be terminated this month and need to be reissued with the new Guarantor.
 
 Thanks--Veronica
