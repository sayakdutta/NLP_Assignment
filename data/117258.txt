 
 It would be nice if they could give us a counterparty name - I've never heard 
 of Jerry Peskuchi.

 Anyone know anything about this?

 Everybody,
 
 Tanya suggested I ask all of you if you know anything related to a hotline 
 call I took yesterday afternoon.  I got a call from John Arnold who wanted to 
 know who was working on getting an ISDA in place with a subsidiary of 
 Citibank. He thought it was a hedge fund, he wasn't sure.  He said that they 
 were getting very impatient to start dealing with us.  He left a contact for 
 Citibank:  Jerry Peskuchi (212) 723-7065, who wants to be updated on the 
 status of the master.
 
 Sorry I didn't bring this up in the morning meeting, but please let me know 
 if any of you know anything about this, because I had no idea who to direct 
 his call to and could only promise to try and find the right person handling 
 this and pass the info on.
