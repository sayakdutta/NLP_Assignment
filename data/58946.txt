 Steve, I don't think we want project our stock price at this point, right?  Jeff used to do this.  Your thoughts.

 I was watching the meeting from my desk.  If my question was asked and answered, I missed it and apologize for asking again.  This is a question that is traditionally asked at these meetings :
 
 Ken,
 
 Where do you think the stock price will be at the end of the year?
