 
 Attached is the text I would like to use for the letters to Feinstein and 
 Murkowski.  Please set up on my letterhead.  Linda or Tom -- any comments?
 
 The Wyden letter is in good shape; I have given Maureen some minor 
 handwritten edits.  It will go out this a.m.
 
 Thanks for everyone's patience.
