 
 This looks like a pretty good list.  My suggestions would be to substitute 
 Elizabeth Sager for Leslie Hansen who is on maternity leave and to add Denis 
 O'Connell in London for credit derivatives.

 questions regarding confirmations in their respective areas.  Please review 
 the list and let me know if you agree with the names chosen.
