 I think you will be looking up in the standings at me with the team you have 
 versus my team so I am fine not doing a deal.  I wonder why everybody wants 
 to do a trade with me?  Could it be my team is better than you keep saying.  
 I think you are simply trying to get over on me like Harry did Lenhart.
