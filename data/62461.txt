 You simply can't negotiate on a choice market.  Are your owed past fees for management? Let me know.  I don't run industrial markets and Greg would have to settle this dispute.  You would lose.
 
  
     
 I think it is going to be difficult for us to convince you that we should take out Houston's share of PML at $11MM when it is not centre of the fairway for ECC (or ENA for that matter). However, at the same time, I don't want to take a hit to earnings given the amount of work that we have put into this thing - legal, board representation, and divestiture efforts.
 
 I think taking me out at my cost ($12.35MM) is a reasonable proposition.
