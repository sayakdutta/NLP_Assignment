 Chris--At this date, CES has a large overhang of storage inventory on AGL.
 To address this situation, I have asked David Scott to increase our IBSS
 withdrawals to the maximum daily withdrawal quantities for the rest of
 February.   Moreover, we also want to maximize our daily withdrawals on the
 directly assigned storage services for the rest February.    We don't want gas
 injected into storage unless it is necessary to avoid a penalty.   David will
 contact Scott about the Directly Assigned storage withdrawals.
 
 To the extent that maximizing our storage withdrawals requires us to cut back
 on flowing gas, the cuts in flowing gas will be sold back to ENA  per our
 contract.
 
 
 Please call me if you have questions, etc.
 
 Thanks.
