 Drew:
 Thank you for your note.  I saw an email in Danny's box yesterday from you 
 with the same return mail, host unknown...
 
 Do you have Danny listed in personal address book?   We experienced some past 
 issues with his email address but, resolved it with new email address, 

 Are you selecting from the address books or typing in his name.  Please 
 advise and I will look into the issue.
 I will leave Danny a voice mail message and have forwarded your message to 
 him.  It is currently in his email box.  
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
   
  
 Julie--pls forward to Danny.  I've had trouble the last couple of days 
 getting emails to go through to him.  Am I doing something wrong?

 Absolutely.  I got a report yesterday on the 30-40 million/day that Phil
 and his guys may be able to squeeze out of the system with debottlenecking
 etc.  We'll be ready to go to expedite any approvals that may be necessary
 on that project.  On the quick 10 million/day that we've been working on,
 there's a potential alternative to building more Gallup horsepower that may
 get us the 10 million much quicker and at a lower cost.  Steve Harris and I
 talked about it yesterday and I hope we can run it to ground in a day or
 two.  We will be ready to file at FERC shortly on the 15,000 hp at Gallup
 if the alternative doesn't pan out.  We'll look at combining the 30-40 mm/d
 project with the Gallup compression for FERC filing purposes.  DF

 Lets make sure we are picking-up on the other ideas Phil has for getting
 additional capacity on Tw.  If any of his ideas require regulatory approval
 we will probably want to include in the same certificate application.
