 Eileen-attached is the resume of the daughter of the good client, Kay Mann
 of Enron (and a rabid fan of the Astros), I spoke to you about. Thanks
 again-John
 
 
     
 Dear Mr. Keffer,
 
 Thank you so much for agreeing to pass my resume along to the appropriate
 person with the Astros organization. In keeping with our family tradition,
 I am a huge Astros fan, and would appreciate the opportunity to get a
 "behind the scenes look" at how a professional sports organization works.
 
 This should be an exciting season for Houston baseball, and it would be an
 honor to be a part of it.  Any assistance you can give in putting me in
 touch with the right person would be appreciated.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Paige Record
