   Cc: IEP Board of Directors
  RE: Legislative Status Report Week Ending 3/9
 
 
 RECENT EVENTS:
 
 -- AB 60x (Hertzberg) is going to be amended before its hearing on Monday.
 The original version would have required, as a condition of permitting a
 powerplant, developers to offer to sell the power to California entities.
 The new amendments do not appear to address IEP=01,s concerns with the meas=
 ure
 and may be even worse.  IEP is currently reviewing the following language
 and is expected to maintain its opposition:
 
 Section 25525.3 is added to the Public Resources Code, to read:
 (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the commission shall
 require, as a condition of certification, that the applicant shall offer to
 enter into a contract to sell to an electrical corporation as defined in
 Section 218 of the Public Utilities Code, a municipal corporation as define=
 d
 in Section 9601 of the Public Utilities Code, or the Department of Water
 Resources, electrical power generated by the facility as its initial and
 continuing available capacity on terms not less favorable than the terms of
 the next offer that the applicant makes for the sale of electrical power
 generated by that facility.
 (b) This section applies to applications filed prior to the effective date
 of the act that added this section that have not been certified by the
 commission prior to that date.
 (c)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the commission
 to delay the adoption of a final decision in any proceeding in which public
 record has been closed and submitted for a final decision.
 (d)  The commission shall adopt rules and regulations for the implementatio=
 n
 and enforcement of this section.
 
 -- AB 8x (Migden), which would give the EOB additional and undefined powers
 related to the coordination of operation and maintenance schedules, passed
 the Assembly Appropriations committee.  As a follow-up to the policy
 committee hearing, IEP submitted comments and amendments to the author=01,s
 office.  Before any changes to the bill are made, Migden=01,s office has
 indicated their preference for a larger stakeholder meeting to address thes=
 e
 and others concerns, which is unlikely to occur before the bill passes off
 the Assembly floor next week.  IEP=01,s primary interest is getting changes=
  to
 the bill that it can live with before it reaches the Senate policy
 committee.
 
 -- SB 39x (Speier), which would define generators as public utilities and
 put the CPUC in the role of coordinating outages and maintenance schedules,
 passed out of the Senate Appropriations Committee with little change.  One
 of the amendments taken would clarify that only owners of the divested
 plants would be subject to the provisions in the bill.  Several generators
 met with Speier this week to plead their case with little affect.  The
 measure will go to the Senate floor next and is expected to pass.  Where
 this measure will find difficulties is in the Assembly, which will have
 already passed out AB 8x (Migden), which accomplishes the same goals as SB
 39x.  Chances are that the Assembly ECA committee would hold SB 39x in
 deference to the committee=01,s position on AB 8x.  The same could be said =
 for
 AB 8x on the Senate side, but AB 8x came from the Administration which may
 give it more weight to move it forward.
 
 -- The Senate Energy Committee heard SB 47x (Battin), which lowers the
 payments of the purchase power agreements between the QFs and the IOUs, but
 did not vote on the measure.  Senator Bowen, Chair of the committee, was
 intent on discussing selected provisions of the bill and their relationship
 to public policy objectives before she felt comfortable taking a vote.  She
 indicated a desire to continue discussions with stakeholders to address and
 clarify issues and concerns in the bill, and bring it up for another hearin=
 g
 and vote most likely next Tuesday.  IEP continues to seek support for the
 measure and add co-authors.
 
 -- The Senate Energy Committee also heard SB 28x (Sher/Battin), which makes
 various changes to the siting process including many IEP-sponsored
 proposals.  So far this is the most comprehensive and positive siting bill
 introduced, with the greatest chance of moving forward.  The bill passed ou=
 t
 of the committee on a 9 to 0 vote even though most of the environmental
 community testified in opposition.  Chris Ellison and I are continuing to
 work with the authors=01, staff to develop additional language which should=
  be
 available before the measure goes to the Assembly.  Senator Bowen, however,
 has indicated she will bring it back to her committee for another hearing i=
 f
 there are any significant changes, slowing the bill=01,s progress.
 
 -- AB 36x (Wright), which would apply specified repower projects to the
 6-month expedited siting process established in AB 970 (2000), passed out o=
 f
 the Assembly Appropriations Committee.  IEP testified in support of the
 bill, still noting we were still working with the author on language.  IEP
 continues to believe that with the current language, few, if any, projects
 would qualify and is working with staff on fixing that.
 
 --  Attached is the most recent legislative tracking reports, both the
 special session and regular session.  Please let me know if you need copies
 of any of these bills.
