 Please only vote if you are an AUBURN  fan or REPUBLICAN!!!!!!!!!? We don't 
 need democrats messing this one  up!!!!!!!!!
 
 PLEASE ROUTE THIS TO ALL ATLANTA  AUBURN CLUB MEMBERS. VOTE FOR? RUDI FOR
 THE
 DOAK WALKER RUNNING BACK  OF THE YEAR AWARD (WHICH IS AWARDED VIA?  FAN
 VOTING
 ONLY).
 
 RUDI IS THE ONLY SEC RUNNING BACK NOMINATED?  THIS YEAR. WHAT AN HONOR FOR
 AUBURN !
 
 BE SURE TO TAKE TIME TO  ARRANGE? THE OTHER CANDIDATES (VIA DRAG AND DROP)
 SO
 THAT THE  REMAINING CANDIDATES ARE? NOT STILL IN THE ORIGINAL  "ALPHABETICAL
 ORDER".
 
 RUDI HAS GIVEN? US MANY A SMILE THIS  SEASON, HAS KEPT HIS ACT CLEAN, AND
 HAS
 ASKED FOR? NOTHING AT ALL IN  RETURN. HE HAS SHOWN US NO "DOWNSIDE".
 THIS
 IS A CLASS INDIVIDUAL. NOW  IT'S OUR TURN TO GIVE SOMETHING BACK TO? RUDI
 FROM HIS THOUSANDS OF  FANS.
 
 IF YOU HAVE FRIENDS IN OTHER AUBURN? CLUBS AROUND THE USA,  PLEASE ALSO
 FORWARD THIS NOTE TO THEM.
