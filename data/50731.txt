 
 Jana,
 
 Hope to see you at the Houstonian tomorrow.
 
 I should be free for the next two weekends Enron permitting).
 My family will be back in Houston around mid-June.
 There will be several concerts at the Pavilion this summer;
 I have already received the schedule.

 Hi there! I am back from my two weeks working on the East Coast.
 
 Let me know your schedule for the next few weeks, so you and David and I, can
 get together for another movie.
 
 When will your family be in town?
 
 I hope to hear you speak tomorrow at the Houstonian. My attending is still
 uncertain.
 
 Hope all is well, and I look forward to our next visit.
 
 Jana
