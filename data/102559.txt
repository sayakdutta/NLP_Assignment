 
 Shelly,
 
 Is there any way you could give me a little more information regarding the 
 times of the presentations for each of the respective schools.
 
 Thanks,

 Analysts:
 
 Your participation is being requested. The schools originally identified for 
 technology recruiting have received a large amount of interest in the  
 Analyst Program.  Therefore additional coverage is necessary, to attend 
 presentations,  at the schools listed below:
 
 October 3 -   Minnesota
 October 11 - Carnegie Melon
 October 12 - NYU
 October 16 - Berkeley
 
 Obviously, we are running on a tight time line.  Your urgent response to this 
 request is greatly appreciated.  Once your attendance is confirmed details 
 will follow.  Please respond to Shelly Jones via email.
 
 
 Thank you for your support.
 Shelly Jones
 Manager, Analyst Recruiting
