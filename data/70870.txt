 
 I used to work at EECC, so I know that noone controls that group!
 
 There is a place in the agreement for a contract number.  I think we ought to 
 use the same contract number as before, but add a distinguishing number or 
 letter- like FV or LVCG.  How does that sound?

 Kay--I left you a voice mail apologizing for your being bombarded with 
 general questions about the C.O.s for Fountain Valley.  My intention was that 
 EE&CC would get the CO into final shape, and just pass it on to you at the 
 point it was ready for GE signature.  I do have one question though, in light 
 of Dale's note below:  how we want to identify the Fountain Valley breakout, 
 as opposed to the previous GE master agreement.  Thanks.

 The way the process works as I understand it, is this:
 
 Last week we developed forms of breakout contracts for each of the turbine 
 "groups" (1 for LV, 1 for Fountain Valley, etc.).
 
 In order to accomplish changes to the individual breakout contracts 
 reflecting changes to project-specific turbines, it was decided that rather 
 than issue any additional change orders under the master (24 unit) contract, 
 either (a) the individual breakout contracts would be modified prior to 
 execution to reflect the changed information; or (b) change orders would be 
 issued under the individual breakout contract.
 
 I worked with the crew last week on the form of breakout contract for the LV 
 turbines.  I haven't done any change orders under that contract.
 
 As I interpret the attachment below, the required modification is to change 
 the reference from CO#6 to the master contract to CO #1 to the Fountain 
 Valley breakout contract.  Of course, I may be missing something here.
 
 I did an earlier change order to the master contract that I could forward, if 
 that would help.

 Dale--I understand that you have done Ge change orders breaking out the LV 
 Cogen equip.  Could you send me a copy of your breakout C.O.? Thanks.

 Gentlemen,
 
 Since we are moving the equipment from WestLB and into TurboPark, and since 
 we are just about there with the breakout contracts, we need to process this 
 as change order #1 to the Fountain Valley contract.  I also believe we need 
 the site specific stuff for this project.

 All,
 
 Attachment contains latest revision reflecting order for two additional
 stacks, six power stabilizers and moving cost for the Fountain Valley
 Project.  Please review and let me know if additional changes are required
 or recommended.
