 
 I was referring to the fact that Bearpaw is an actual marketing affiliate of NNG and is posted as such on the website.  Bearpaw has a transport contract on NNG.
 
  
     
 I want to clarify something from our Reg Roundtable earlier today. Bearpaw is currently a "potential marketing affiliate" of NBPL, and so far has not  crossed the line to actually trigger an event that would make them a full fledged MA. We are careful not to trigger such an event. Bearpaw may be a MA of NNG due to some contract activity on NNG, but that is not a problem for NBPL. Shelly, if you see it differently, please let me know.
