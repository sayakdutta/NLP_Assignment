 increase in demand created by this new generation.  I have cross referenced 
 some of your info with some info from the power desk.  this info is 
 attached.  In addition, it would be helpful to get a copy of the maps you 
 mentioned below.  Please let me know when you can send the maps.
 
 
 Thanks,
 
 Eric

 Here is the information that I have compiled about new IPPs in Texas.  What 
 exactly are you using this for? I also have ArcView maps of the majority of 
 all the plant locations with surrounding pipelines. If you have any 
 information about new IPPs that I do not have I will be very interested.
