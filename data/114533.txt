 
 Yes, the correct name does include "Inc." at the end. And yes, Steve Hall 
 said the master agreement works for this trade. He and Bob Ellery at Sierra 
 talked over the agreement and decided to use the name that Sierra Pacific 
 Holding Co. is doing business under. I've changed the deal (573679) in 
 EnPower. Please let me know if you turn up any more questions.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate

 Hello, Sierra Pacific Industries, Inc. is a choice in Enpower.  Is this the 
 correct name with the "Inc." on it?  I am assuming that Steve Hall said it is 
 OK to use the master agreement for this trade.
 
 Thanks,
 Melissa

 Regarding the deal Chris Foster did on 4/6 with Sierra Pacific Holding Co. -
 
 Bob Ellery, Sierra's Director of Energy Resources, and Steve Hall, one of 
 Portland's most expeditious lawyers, have decided to execute the deal under 
 the designation Sierra Pacific Industries, which is also named in the master 
 agreement. We still, however, need this name added to the counterparty list 
 in EnPower.
 
 Thank you all for your help on this, and I appreciate your future assistance 
 in getting this deal out of the "New Counterparty" void.
