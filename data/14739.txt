 
 Hi There. So glad you are back.  How was skiing?  Hope we can get together on Sat. or Sun.
 
 I never know the polite way to suggest gifts.  Perhaps just a gift ideas list?
 
 Summer clothes (Size 4T pants/5T shirts) 
 Swimming accessories
 Loving Family Dollhouse Furniture & Accessories
 Gift certificates
 
 * In lieu of gifts, contributions can be made in Alina's honor to Kidsave International
 
 
     
 
 Hi! The invites are nearly ready to go. I just need the map to Rosemary's
 home. 
 
 Also, Shelley -- we discussed that you may want to direct people to certain
 things or places for gifts (e.g., books). Let me know what you the invite to
 say and, if clothes are still an option, remind me what sizes.
 
 Thanks!
