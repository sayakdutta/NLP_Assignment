 I have been in Atlanta for two weeks and am continuing to unpack and
 assemble furniture. I thought of you last night as I came across the
 wonderful surrealism book that you gave me; what a great book. Of
 course, I had to stop my unpacking to read through parts of it. I did
 not get much unapcking done, but I had fun.
 I reconnected with Christina Johns, one of my roomates at Penn with
 Dori and she passed along Dori's email address. I sent her an email
 and she responded, and appears to be happy in Philly with her 18
 month old daughter. I told her that we had seen each other in NYC
 during the past years and gave her an update on your successes and
 accomplishments.
 I hope that work is going well. I have to return to an orientation
 session. My new phone number (404)248-2290 and address 757 Houston
 Mill Rd. NE, Apt. 8 Atlanta, GA. 30329-4240. Does Enron have an
 office in Atlanta?
 Best,
 andi
