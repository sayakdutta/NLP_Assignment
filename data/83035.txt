 Scott,
 
 As you are already aware, we have to provide volume (settled sales only) 
 explanations to Investor Relations each month.  Given that it's a quarter end 
 month, it is even more important that we receive good explanations which 
 sufficiently support your trading business.  The format includes a year to 
 year comparison, quarter to quarter comparison as well as a month to month 
 comparison for any increases/decreases greater than 10%.  Your stats are as 
 follows:
 
 EAST GAS TRADING (Bbtu/Day - Settled Sales Only)
 
 Year to Year
 September 2000 7,258
 September 1999 3,179
 Increase  128%
 
 Quarter to Quarter
 3Q 2000  7,282
 3Q 1999  2,910
 Increase  150%
 
 If you could send me an explanation explaining what's driving your increase 
 by tomorrow morning, that would be great.
 
 Thanks, Paula
