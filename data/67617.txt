 
 FYI-
 We need to be more careful with which of the two curves above we use for 
 physical deals.  We have had some substantial OA for Jan 01 production 
 because the basis curves for these two locations were .30 different.  Usually 
 these are less than .05 different.  If you have a physical mich physical it 
 should be Mich_cg-gd in tagg(which is michigan consolidated pipe in sitara), 
 if it is consumers power, it will be mich/cons and cec pipe in sitara.  Any 
 questions, ask.  Thanks.
