 
 Can you please help Greg get this info.  I have to think that we have this 
 info somewhere.

 John,
 
 I want to update you on the additional information you requested yesterday 
 (intrinsic and extrinsic $ assigned to each deal when originally booked).  
 
 Due to changes in personnel, the time that has elapsed, and the Excel model 
 used in the original valuation of the deals, obtaining the initial values has 
 proven to be more of a challenge than I had initially anticipated.  I am 
 working with the current book administrators for the transport model to pull 
 together what information we can find.  I have also spoken with Colleen and 
 placed phone calls to the prior (and original) administrator of the transport 
 option model.
 
 I am not sure, at this point, that we will be able to pin down the original 
 values for all of the deals.  I will get you what I can, as soon as I can.  
 In the meantime, please let me know if you have questions and/or concerns.
 
 Greg
