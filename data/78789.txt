 changes to all the systems that need to occur for bid week.

 Bob, 
 Just wanted to pass the information I am getting below on to you. Didn't you think we would not know until the 18th?
 See below, Tom Martin is wanting products changed on the 16th. Do you have any news I don't have yet.
 Thanks for your help.

 Please note "HLP" change below.  Thanks.
  
     
 Barbara Gray has informed me that you have been inquiring about modifying the Texas EOL physical products to ENA as the counterparty for June.  The products you have to be concerned about are Waha and Exxon Katy Tailgate.  The other physical products are HPL related and will no longer be used.  There is a slight possibility that the Agua Dulce product may continue but I will contact you if it needs to be changed to ENA.  Our need for these ENA products will be approximately May 16th, when we want to roll out our June products.
 
 Please call me if you have any questions.
 
 Tom
