 
 I'd really appreciate it. 
 
  Thanks,  Kay
 
 
    
  
 I have reviewed the latest revisions to the two amendments that are being 
 contemplated for this deal.  They should be signed either today or tomorrow.
 
 I assume that you would prefer that I remain responsible for these for the 
 next day or so (and get them signed).  If this is not the case, please advise.
