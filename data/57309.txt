 Just checking to be sure you're okay with a March 1 start date for Iris?

 Hi,
 
      Thanks for the Fed Ex with the offer letter, and other pertinent
 information about Enron.
 
      I have signed the letter and returned it to you, along with a couple of
 other forms.  You should receive these documents via Fed Ex on tomorrow
 morning.
 
      Because I have to tie up a few loose ends here in California, I won't
 be able to start until March 1st.  I hope that is okay.
 
      Thanks so much.
 
 Regards,
 Iris
