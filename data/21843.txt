 Attached are revised versions of the gas supplier security agreement and the
 intercreditor agreement, marked to show changes against the draft dated
 February 2, 2001.
 
 In addition I have included the unmarked versions of these documents for
 execution.  Please arrange to have the agreements executed on behalf of your
 organization and fax the signature pages to me.  I would appreciate you
 sending three executed original signature pages to me by overnight mail; I
 will return fully executed counterparts to you.
 
 You will note that we assembled the addresses for notices on Schedule I
 based on available information.  Please make any corrections necessary to
 this notice section before signing.  Also note that we have limited the
 address for notices for each legal entity to one address, and have not
 included copies for attorneys and the like. We anticipate that the list of
 addresses for notices will grow to be very long and would like to limit the
 addresses to which various notices and reports will be sent.  Please be sure
 that the person designated to receive notices on behalf of your organization
 will be able to forward copies to the other persons who need to receive
 them.
 
 Please forward all correspondence to:
