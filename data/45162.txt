 US, the only response I expect will be from Leslie, with all declines for 
 power.  I NEED TO HEAR FROM AUSTRALIA TODAY ON THEIR COUNTERPARTIES.

 Attached below is a list of Australian and Japanese counterparties for the 
 Australian and Japanese weather launch.  As they are actually launching these 
 products this afternoon, your immediate attention would be GREATLY 
 appreciated.  Let me know of any potential conflicts ( other than the obvious 
 lack of time) and I will do what ever possible to help.
 
 Thanks for your extraordinary efforts!!!!!!
 
 Frank
