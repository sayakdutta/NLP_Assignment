 away?  Thanks.   Jeff

 Can't get bigger with lousy IT support in London.  This has been an issue for 
 some time.  Lot's of people look concerned -but not too much improvement.

 as usual we were the first group in london to spot that the enron server in 
 houston was having some problems and a big back log of messages (for good 
 reasons as we were anxiously awaiting  an incoming message which never came 
 on one of our ship which is in a delicate situation).
 why on earth is it that we don t get a warning that there is a problem so 
 that we can tell our customers, suppliers to use direct fax line s or other 
 means of communications  . in this instance the long awaited message was 
 worth 60 000 usd but could have been much more .
