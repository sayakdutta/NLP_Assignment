 I don't see that icon, but I don't really know what I'm looking for.
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
   
  
 Thanks!  I will be placing it on the calendar.  Do you have the icon on your 
 Lotus Notes workspace desktop?  It's the  "Merchant Finance on ECTHOU_..." 
 icon.

 That should be fine.  Just let us know for sure when you know.
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
   
  
 Marnie -
 
 I think I need to take a half day of vacation Friday, Oct. 20th.  I am 
 involved in some church activities next weekend and I won't find out if I 
 need this time off until tonight or Wednesday night.  Is that too short of 
 notice?
