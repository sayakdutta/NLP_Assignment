 Hello, I am producing this year's 'Real Options Training Course' on behalf
 of the Risk Waters Group in NY.  I am very interested in hearing your
 comments and suggestions regarding the issues surrounding real options, in
 addition to hearing what type of research Enron has been doing with real
 options (as well as a possible speaker position).  Thanks again, I look
 forward to speaking with you.
 
 Best Regards,
