 
 if there are 5 franchise players then the order should be supplemental 1 through say 7
 
 round one should go supplemental teams  7 to 1 then franchise teams in reverse order
 of how they ranked the previous year
 
 round 2 through what ever is the same as the other draft we did
 
 
 
  
     
 why?
