 ATTENTION ALL SHIPPERS/NOMINATING AGENTS AND PLANT OPERATORS: 
 
 
 Due to the continuing warm weather and other operational considerations, Public Service Company (PSCo) cannot accept either:
 
 Imbalance payback gas from Shippers/Nominating Agents, or 
 More gas than what is currently confirmed from each plant into PSCo's system. 
 
 
 
 Plant Operators should restrict deliveries to confirmed nominations ONLY for gas days November 3 - 4; if over-deliveries become a problem during this period, PSCo may activate flow control valves on any plants involved.
 
 Shippers/Nominating Agents should not nominate any imbalance payback to PSCo for gas days November 3 - 4.  Any imbalance gas remaining on the system for this period will be cut to -0- by PSCo.  Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
 
 
 Sincerely,
