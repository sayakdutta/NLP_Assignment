 Jeff,
 
 I spoke with your assistant earlier this week to get a date where you would 
 be available to meet with El Paso regarding current LNG opportunities.  
 Unfortunately, Eisbrenner (Senior VP El Paso Merchant Energy Services) was 
 only available on Friday October 13th.    
 
 Please come back to me if you can juggle your schedule to join us.  I have 
 not invited any of the initial team for the time being.
 
 Thanks
 Eric

 The agenda and date work well for El Paso.  I will attend the meeting along
 with John Hattenberg, Senior VP, LNG & David Jenkins, VP, LNG.  We look
 forward to our meeting.
 
 Best regards,
