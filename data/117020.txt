 I've been having trouble getting this e-mail to go through to Robin Tompkins 
 at Portland General.  Would you please either find Robin's correct e-mail 
 address and forward it to her or call and get her fax number and fax it to 
 her.
 
 Thanks.
 
 Mark

 Robin:
 
 We use two firms for U.S. derivatives advice - both in New York and both 
 highly recommended:
 
 David Mitchell of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft (212)504-6285 Ken Raisler of 
 Sullivan & Cromwell (212)558-4675
 
 David we use for contract issues - what should our forms look like under 
 various conditions, etc. and Ken, who is a former General Counsel of the 
 CFTC, we use for policy questions, political (lobbying) and e-commerce 
 issues.  Please feel free to use my name when contacting either of them.  If 
 neither of these is exactly what you are looking for, let me know and I can 
 put you in touch with others.
 
 Mark
