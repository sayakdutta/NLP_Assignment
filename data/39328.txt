 dear mr. haedicke: i am a peruvian citizen graduated in the us working in
 the international metals trading business since 1987. i work as senior
 trader for a major private mining company in peru who produces precious and
 base metals which are all exported to exclusively 2 endusers in the us. our
 company also is involved since 1989 in hedging its output of copper, zinc,
 gold and silver in comex and lme markets.
 the reason i am contacting you is because i regularly receive literature
 from comex and i see that your company is the largest natural gas trader in
 the world and i was hoping to see if your company could be interested to
 participate in the international tender of exploiting and distributing the
 camisea natural gas project in south eastern peru.
 if you are interested pls let me know so that i can send you detailed
 information on this project by mail.
 best regards,
 roberto sanchez
