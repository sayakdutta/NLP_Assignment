 Hello to all.
 
 This e mail is just a request for completion status of the GE Breakout 
 contract for the LVCII gas turbines.  We are contemplating a full notice to 
 proceed with the EPC contractor May 1, 2001.  The breakout contract is an 
 exhibit to the EPC contract, and we would like to have the executed version 
 for our file.
 
 No pressure - just a request for status and a heads up as to what is ongoing 
 with the LVCII project.
 
 Cheers
 
 Bill W.
