 Just following up from our conversation last week.  We continue to do a large 
 amount of transactions with this counterparty which are being confirmed 
 through our long form agreements without credit terms.  To the extent that 
 you decide not to forward the ISDA at this time, please let me know so that I 
 can make a determination whether or not we need to reduce trade in order to 
 control Enron's credit exposure.  Please let me know the status.
 
 Thanks,
 Ed Sacks
