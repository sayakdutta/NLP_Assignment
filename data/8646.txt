 
 It's 11:55 am on Sunday - have tried your cell phone, but did not get an answer.  Left you a message that Beth, Jeff, and Brent are all here and working on their respective pieces.  We will convene as a group about 12:30 here in my office.  If you can join us at 1:00, we can give you an update.  --Sally 
 
 
     
 
 Hi Sally,
  
 FYI, I'm going to have a window of about 1 'till 4 on Sunday afternoon that I can make it into the office. I'll have my cell with me at all times.
  
 Regards
