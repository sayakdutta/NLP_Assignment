 Drew,
 
 I just finished leaving you a voicemail message in response to your question 
 about a contact in the state tax area.   I'm not sure the voicemail system 
 saved my message, however, because it didn't respond in the same manner as 
 the system here.
 Just in case, I thought I would leave you this e:mail message as well.   
 
 The person whose name I left you in the last message was Jerry Moore (713) 
 853-1712.   Another person who might be helpful is Carol Brantz (713) 
 853-7180.   I'm not sure which of these folks is more apppropriate for 
 purposes of obtaining an answer to your question.   Good luck.
 
 Regards,
 AnnMarie
