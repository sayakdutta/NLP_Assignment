 Tom,
 I have talked with Rodney Malcolm and several originators and they need two 
 financial swap term sheets, one for Enron paying fixed and one for Enron 
 paying floating. To this end, I have revised our generic document and created 
 two new documents. Could you review each of these, and if they meet with your 
 approval, please forward them back to me. Thanks.
