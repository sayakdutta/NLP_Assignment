 La Joie du Vin and the Italian Cultural and Community Center are pleased to 
 announce an Italian wine tasting. Scott Spencer, the owner of Wines of 
 America, will be leading our tasting of six red
 wines, each from a different winegrowing region.  Admission is $30 for 
 members of our organization and $35 for nonmembers.  Mark your calendars now 
 for Thursday, August 5th. We will be donating our proceeds to the Children's 
 Scholarship Fund of the Italian Cultural and Community Center.
 
 Visit our website at http://www.lajoieduvin.org/events/1999august.htm for 
 more detailed information and instructions regarding reserving admission to 
 the tasting.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Greg Giordano
 Director
