 
 Hello Miss Cynthia,  I am doing fine.  Work has been really kicking my butt 
 lately.   Lunch Tuesday works for me.  I will give you a call on Monday to 
 confirm.  Hope everything is going well with you also.  Take care.

 Hi Mr. Nemec, how are ya? Hope all is well. I am going through my
 appointments and was going to see if you wanted to try and meet for lunch
 one day next week. I can't go on Wednesday, but the rest of my week looks
 pretty open. I want to try Hard Rock Cafe downtown beacuse I have trade
 there and I have never tried it before. Besides, it is close to your office.
 
 Call me or e-mail me if you want to try and get together next week. Talk to
 you soon.
 
 Cynthia
