 Mary Cook asked me to contact you regarding locating documents in connection with a couple of prepays.  The first is a prepay (December 13, 1999)  among ENA, Citibank, Barclays, Royal Bank of Scotland and Toronto Dominion.  Is this Yosemite II?  If so, I have copies of the ISDA, swap confirms, etc.  Would you have copies of any other documents, or are there any other documents?  Also, they are looking for documentation in connection with the Corp. prepay for December 2000.  This was among ENA, Toronto Dominion, Credit Suisse First Boston and Morgan Stanley.  Do you happen to have copies of these documents or do you know the project name in case they were prepared here?
 
 Thanks!
 
 Marie
