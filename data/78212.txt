 The original membership certificate for the 80% interest should be forwarde=
 d
 for delivery on Wednesday, May 2, to the following address:
 
    Ms. Isabel Parker
    Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP
    520 Madison Avenue, 34th Floor
    New York, NY  10022
    (phone 212-277-4025)
 
 (Greg has asked that the membership certificate be faxed to him (fax
 203-674-7646) and me (fax 713-751-3280) on Tuesday before depositing this
 with the overnight courier).
 
 If you will also be sending the original signature pages to the Turbine
 Contract and the Amended and Restated LLC Agreement, these documents should
 be forwarded for delivery on Wednesday, May 2, to:
 
    Mr. Gregory F. Lang
    Paul Hastings Janofsky & Walker LLP
    1055 Washington Blvd.
    Stamford, CT  06901
    (phone 203-961-7446)
 
 I am happy to get these documents to the correct place if the signed
 documents are in Houston on Tuesday.  Let me know.  Thanks.

 Please confirm absolutely that fax signatures will be sufficient.
 
 I need the address of where to send the membership certificate.  There is
 not enough time for the document to pass back through Houston if the
 Portland team wants to sign the documents.

 The original membership certificate needs to be in the lender's hands
 (i.e.,
 Isabel Parker's office) on Wednesday in order to release escrow.  If you
 have the original to me by Tuesday, I can forward it to Isabel by overnight
 delivery for Wednesday.  It must be an original, in that the lender's lien
 on the membership interest is not perfected without possession of the
 original certificate.  With respect to the remaining documents, fax copies
 of signature pages on the closing date should be sufficient.

 The problem is in getting the original in their hands (where?) by tomorrow.
 Does it have to be an original?

 Can we at least get the membership certificates signed by Tuesday?  This
 seems to be the only document required in advance of closing.  If we can't
 get the 80% membership interest certificate in the lender's possession on
 the closing date, then there is a lien perfection issue for them to deal
 with, and I thought we could accommodate their request and avoid the
 problem
 altogether.  Please advise, as Greg and Isabel will be calling within an
 hour or so to finalize the mechanics on this.  Thanks.

 I've asked GE for the LOC by Wednesday, but I haven't gotten a response.
 
 I'll have difficulty getting executed docs by Tuesday, since sigs are
 coming from Portland.  I'll have to check to see what can be done.

 Can you get executed documents back to me on Tuesday?  Greg has requested
 that we send the original membership certificate representing the 80%
 interest to the collateral agent Tuesday night by overnight delivery to
 hold
 in escrow until closing, in order that the collateral agent is in
 possession
 of the certificate (for purposes of legal opinions) upon closing on
 Wednesday.  Greg is planning to fax signature pages of all of their closing
 documents later today.  (I will be out of the office at a meeting with
 another client most of the afternoon today).
 
 There is one last question with GE dealing with the letter of credit for
 the
 retention amount, as this affects our disbursement instruction letter.  I
 advised Greg that GE's normal practice was to send the retention L/C after
 receipt of payment.  He is considering this, but may want to talk to GE
 about the ability to present the L/C at closing.  Do you have any thoughts
 on this?
