 Per the email below, before we respond to Glencore we just wanted to make 
 sure that you haven't made any agreements with Glencore with respect to 
 choice of law for the online trades that would subject them to UK law.
 
 I don't want to talk to them without checking with you first since this is 
 one of the true counterparties that we are trading with on both sides of the 
 Atlantic.
 
 By the way, I heard you had some really good news.  I'm so happy for you!

 Please see the email below - can you please look into Glencore's
 assertion that their EOL trades (vs. ENA) should be governed under English
 law.  
 
 Thanks,

 Hi,
 
 I have received a call from Miriam in Glencore re EOL transactions.  Her 
 concerned are that she does not receive the confirmations within 24 Hours 
 (from Houston) of the deal being dealt which we are subject to in London and 
 she would like to see this from ENA.  Also, when Glencore agreed to trade EOL 
 transactions they stipulated that English law be used for all transactions, 
 presuming these would be the same from ENA.  She has tried to call but only 
 gets voice mail, could you please contact her to discuss these and any other 
 issues she has with EOL.

 Regards,
