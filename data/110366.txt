 Matt,
 
 You're positions will not show up tonight until we "load" them.  This will be done once your P&L is calculated for the night.  After tonight, your trades will hit immediately after they are executed.
 
 Please call with any questions.

 Kam,
 
 Now I tried msmith18_pc and my trading track simulation book was available to select, but nothing else.
