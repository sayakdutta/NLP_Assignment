 
 You're so right! I checked around and found that Arizona Public Service still 
 does the transmission deals for Pinnacle West. I'll change both deals right 
 away.
 
 Thanks,

 Hello, I think the above deals should be in as Arizona Public Service since 
 they are transmission deals.  Let me know what you find out.
 
 Thanks alot,
 Melissa
