 Attached are amendments to AB 60x which IEP is presenting today at a 2:30
 meeting with Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg.  As a follow-up to the meeting,
 IEP member company lobbyists will join me on a conference call at 3:45 today
 to discuss strategy on "shopping" this language to the Assembly
 Appropriations Committee members.  You are welcome to join in on that
 conference call.
