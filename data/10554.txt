 Glen,
 At this time, Wednesday afternoon is the only time that seems to work for Lindy Donoho, Lynn Blair, and Terry Kowalke. Teb, please let Glen know if this day is ok for you. Thank you.

 It would probably be a good idea to have a meeting/conf. call next week to discuss this data.  Please me know when you are available and I'll schedule a meeting.  Thanks.  gh
 
  
     
 Here is the information that was requested from our last meeting on Oct. 31, 2001. The last page of the report has the summary of the whole report. If you have questions, please respond. When is the next meeting? Thank you.
