 I have not seen the email from Kevin.  Would someone please send me a copy so 
 that I can call him to discuss.
 
  Thanks, Swig

 I will revise the documents to reflect Flagstaff and the items we discussed 
 at the meeting previously.  
 
 Kevin's email indicates he wants to remove the language concerning a party 
 obligations to refund the costs of the interconnect paid for by that party, 
 if the other party is unable to maintain their pressure obligations. 
 
 Does this need to stay or be removed?  If this needs to stay, should someone 
 tell Kevin that it will remain in the agreement ?

 MidCon has decided to move forward with Flagstaff.  We have until November to 
 complete this project.  I suggest that we begin condemnation proceedings now 
 against the landowners of the property that we need.  We have been in 
 unfruitful discussions with this family up until now.  We need to get the ROW 
 for this project moving so Tom can prepare a new cost estimate for the 
 facilities.

 We want to leave it at Flagstaff.  Also, lets remove the penalty language in
 the Facility Agreements.  Since we are both paying for our own facilities, I
 don't think it is needed.
 
 
     
 
 
 
 Have you reached an agreement within your shop about the location of the
 second
 interconnect between the two companies?
