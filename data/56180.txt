 Joe,
 
 I would like to invite you to an off-site meeting of John Griebling's 
 organization
 and the Research Group. 
 
  Location:  Breckenridge, Colorado
 
 
 As you know, John Griebling is managing the network design and construction 
 project
 currently under way in EBS. The Research Group is actively involved in this 
 effort
 which requires advanced quantitative skills in the area of stochastic 
 optimization and
 stochastic processes (for modeling and forecasting Internet traffic flows).
 
 The objective of this meeting is to develop common language and accomplish 
 transfer 
 of skills between the two groups, to facilitate cooperation on this project 
 in the future.
 
 We are inviting Ken Rice and Kevin Hannon to this meeting. We would 
 appreciate if you could
 speak, together with Kevin and Ken, on strategic directions of EBS. It is 
 important for a group
 of technical people, with relatively specialized technical skills, to 
 understand the big picture.
 
 I am attaching the preliminary agenda for this meeting.
 
 Vince Kaminski
