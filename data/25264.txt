 We created deal 229758 a while back to correct this.  You will need to get 
 Vol Mgmt to reallocate volumes from #157288 to this deal to close it out.

 Deal #157288
 
 It appears that the price on PGEV should be Index less $.06 not Index less 
 $.05 for the redelivery.
 Let me know which is correct per the exchange agreement.
 
 Thanks-
