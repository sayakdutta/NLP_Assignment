 Make sure you talk to Casey & John.  Most of my Houston group has been out of the office either this morning or this afternoon for a UBS orientation.

 Fallon has requested a DPR be prepared 2X a week for positions that we are executing on (active/live positions only, no terminations or deals we are not executing on).  We have put together the shell of how this DPR will look.  To start this process we are planning to present to him positions (column E) and PRM value (column X) as of 1/23.  To do this, we have laid out the following steps:
  
 - we need to get the PRM values directly from you (column X)
 - we will run the benchmarks and need to work with you to ensure you are happy with the benchmark numbers we have pulled from RMS (the exception is gas, we need the gas risk group to provide the gas bench to us)
 - we need all of then exceptions/qualifications to your numbers
 - we will need the other information in the schedule to be reported to us starting next week, but not for this exercise
  
 Please confirm to me/Shona that you can get us this info by 230 pm today.
  
 Lastly, I am attaching the unofficialized book list as these books will not make it into the benchmarks and need you to confirm that there are no 3rd party positions in these books.
  
 Thanks in advance
