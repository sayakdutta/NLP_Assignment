 
 We will not be there next week so that should be fine.  Are the complex derivatives group and 'structured book' run by Paul Darcy the same thing?  If yes, then we are planning on reviewing that area.  Should I contact Paul Darcy directly?  If no, what is the complex derivatives group?
 
 Thanks,
 Stacey
 
  
     
 Also in addition can you please confirm that you are not doing the complex derivatives group which is run totally separately in both personnel and risk terms ?
 
 Thanks
 
 
 
  
     
 Are you here next week then because I am due to be away for some of that time ?
 
 
 
  
     
 James,
 
 Just a quick note and request regarding our UK & Continental Power Doorstep review we will be performing.  Please provide a list of books, curves and deal types used for UK & Continental Power.  In addition, please send information on any large, structured, out of the norm transactions and any transactions that are calculated outside of the core trading system.
 
 Please provide this information early next week.  Look forward to seeing you.
 
 Stacey
