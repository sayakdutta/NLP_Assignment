 
 I had a brief conversation with Vicki about splitting the costs 50/50 on the 
 legal side to be consistent with the business arrangement.  She asked to use 
 the European operation as  a model.  At some point, Peter you should just 
 give Vicki a call and talk it through.

 To be brief, this project is percolating but being held up on the following 
 fronts:  
 
 1.  ENA/EES issues.  I have not been involved so I don't know where it is 
 at.  As request by Dave P., Mark P. has sent a copy of his preliminary issues 
 memo to Vicki S.  
 
 2.  Market Achievement Plan for unsold PPAs.  The Government is expected to 
 announce October 31st.  This will impact the market in many aspects, 
 including the viability of competitive retail market options v. regulated 
 rate options.  
 
 3.  We have proposals from two law firms.  Donahue Ernst & Young and Blakes.  
 My preference would be DEY for diversification reasons, but DEY may have 
 unresolvable conflicts which I would have to discuss with you if we are to 
 proceed.  Blakes proposal may also have significant conflicts, which may be 
 resolvable but which may limit the effectiveness of their representation.  
 Nonetheless, it seems a decision will not need to be made until the end of 
 October.  In the meantime, Mark P. is working on scoping out legal and 
 compliance issues, as well as forms.
 
 Peter.
