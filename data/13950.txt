 I think we are planning to hire all the mill workers listed on the schedule attached to the agreement.  We will be agreeing to some of the requests in their agreement, but not most of the substantive ones, such as their request that we trade out value for unvested GP stock options for Enron stock options, their demand that we maintain bonus programs that are similar, etc.  George's view is that we will control how we handle the employees, not GP.

 Are we not planning to hire substantially all the employees or isThis just the old "what we are actually going to do vs. What they want to try to bind us to do" thing and if it's the latter, how much " warm and fuzzy can we give 'em?

 Don't worry about the "substantially similar" benefits issue--- I will deal with it.  Offering a job to all or substantially all employees is bigger issue.  Recognizing your need for flexiblity, we need to find a solution to that issue.
