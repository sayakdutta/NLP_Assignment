 Hi Sara.  I did just hear. Your approach sounds fine.  Do you have a schedule 
 of trades, or should I try and dig one up?

 Hi, Steve:
 
 We am preparing a form of assignment from ECT Investments, Inc. in favor of
 Enron North America Corp. whch will transfer several credit derivative
 Transactions.  I anticipate an attachment to the assignment which will
 identify the trades.  I believe that Bill Bradford (Ernon) and Mark
 Tarkington have discussed these trades and Bill is sending me the list.
 
 Please let me know that you are aware of this request.  Thanks.
