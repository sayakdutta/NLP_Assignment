 Rick / Vince,
 
 Good morning.
 
 In my 9/14 e-mail, I advised you of the practitioner-industry CEFER (Center
 for Energy Finance Education and Research) Conference we are planning for
 Spring 2001.  As you know, we would like to invite Jeff Skilling to be the
 keynote speaker at the Thur. evening dinner.  The following day's four
 topics consist of Risk management, Deregulation, Real options, and
 International/globalization.  The majority of invitees would be
 (predominantly U. S.-based) energy-industry practitioners, as well as
 several academics.
 
 Given lead time issues in these matters, we have reserved hotel rooms in
 Austin for Feb. 22, 2001.  Could I ask you to ascertain Jeff Skilling's
 availability for that evening?
 
 Thanks,
 Ehud Ronn
