 As i have mentioned, I need to fill the vacant Carlos Sole slot here at EEOS. 
 Vicki had agreed this, but I wanted to run this past you before I move on 
 it.  Between the work we do to support the ENA projects, the Pipeline Group 
 work, and our claims and litigation, I think I do need to fill the vacancy 
 with a lawyer.
 
 I have identified a candidate that has significant construction experience 
 that I would like to bring in next Tuesday afternoon for an initial screen, 
 but before I do that I wanted to see if you are on board with me filling the 
 slot.  
 
 I  would not trouble you with an interview request unless after I meet her I 
 think she is a strong enough candidate to pursue further.
