 
 To re-cap:
 I will talk to Will Smith in Houston IT about adding a function in Deal 
 Blotter to choose confirm or no confirm. In the meantime, Houston Confirms 
 group would greatly appreciate us changing these deals to no confirm. They 
 will assume that all daily deals done with PGE are no confirm, but the deals 
 will still show up on their report (and cause confirm group crankiness) if 
 they are marked to be confirmed. Thanks for your help.

 I just heard the same.  I was talking to Tim about the requirements being 
 made regarding daily confirmations, and the final decision was not to confirm 
 PGE daily deals.  Question though,  when we put deals into the system in 
 Blotter, they automatically confirm.  Do we have to go into every deal and 
 switch the flag or is there a better way around it?
