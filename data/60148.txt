 Louise, attached is a spreadsheet with details regarding setting up pipeline transportation contracts for NETCO. In addition to the contract setup, Gas Logistics is working with the IT group on the splitting of the Estate and NETCO trading environments. 
 
 Note: The prioritization of what pipes to tackle first was dictated by the Gas Desk Heads.
