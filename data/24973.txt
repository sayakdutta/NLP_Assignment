 I got 4. 
 
  
     
 
 Check this out!  It's hard, so good luck finding four or five things! 
 This is a simple psychoanalytic test to measure your memory. 
 Open the first superman picture. 
 Memorize it and open the second. 
 Without reopening the first try to note each of the differences between the 
 two pictures.  There are at least three.  If you can find five or more, you 
 are of above average intelligence.
