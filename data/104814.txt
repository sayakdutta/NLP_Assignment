 By way of introduction, I am a lawyer with Enron North America Corp.("ENA") 
 in the derivatives area.  I have read your memorandum of March 17, 1997 which 
 was prepared for us and which addressed both physical and financial trading 
 issues.
 
 I am also aware of the recent memo which you prepared for Brent Hendry re:  
 internet trading.
 
 I have two (2) followup questions for you limited specifically to financial 
 trading (NOT VIA INTERNET):
 
  (1)  Do you have any changes to add to your memo of March 17, 1997 with 
 respect to financial trading?
 
  (2)  Would you modify ENA's Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement (which I 
 believe Brent Hendry recently forwarded to your attention)?
 
 I look forward to hearing from you.  ENA is about to execute a trade with a 
 Chilean corporate and I will most likely see the trade confirmation in the 
 next day or so.  You can reach me via email or by phone at (713) 853-5620.  
 Thank you very much.  
 
 Sara
