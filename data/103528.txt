  ("ENA") and Societe Industrielle de Transports Automobile S.A. (the 
 "Agreement")
 
 Dear Ms Lavergne
 
 Further to my email of 14 April 2000 attaching the first drafts of the 
 Schedule and the CSA to the Agreement and the Parent Guaranty, I attach 
 revised first drafts blacklined against the previous version to show changes.
 
 These contain minor changes predominantly resulting from changing the Enron 
 counterparty entity from Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp. 
 to ENA..
 
 I look forward to hearing from  you.  If I am unavailable please contact my 
 colleague, Deepak Sitlani who is also working on this matter (also on 
 telephone number +44 20 7783 4539).
 
 Kind regards
 Michael Khajeh-Noori
