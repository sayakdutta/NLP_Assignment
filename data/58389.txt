 
 When we talked about me speaking at the conference in Nov. Enron's management 
 conference had not yet been scheduled.  Now it has and, of course, it 
 conflicts... it also conflicts out just about every other senior person at 
 Enron.  I will take care of finding a substitute, but wanted your thoughts on 
 a couple of candidates:  how about Seabron Adamson, Richard Tabors or Scott 
 Magrane(sp?).  The latter is at Goldman Sachs and, last time I talked to him, 
 was working on Transcos.
 
 Let me know what you think and let me know who you were working with at FEBA 
 so I can take care of the problem.
 Thanks
