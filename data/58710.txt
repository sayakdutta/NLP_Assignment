 In response to the possibility of terrorist actions in retaliation for ongoing U.S. military operations against sites in Afghanistan, federal authorities have taken the following actions:
 
 1) DOE has increased its security condition from SECON-3 to SECON-2.  Per DOE, SECON-2 "is set when a terrorist incident occurs or intelligence information is received indicating that some form of terrorist action is imminent, and requires specific protection measures to be put in place."
 2) NERC has gone to its highest threat level, Threat Level 3.
 3) DOT's Office of Pipeline Safety has opened its Crisis Management Center.
 
 In addition, the Energy Security Council, while noting that no specific threats against any infrastructure have been been identified, today urged participants to maintain the highest levels of vigilance and evaluate whether additional security measures were warranted.
