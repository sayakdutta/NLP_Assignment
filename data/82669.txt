 
 Hey, how did the appointment go yesterday?  Were you trying to e-mail me 
 yesterday?  I received a message regarding returned mail, did you get one as 
 well?
 
 I spoke with Val the other day and also said hi to Aunt Ethel.  They seem to 
 be fine.  Val and I had been playing telephone tag ( really did not want to 
 talk with her because she ticked me off, but I'm over it now) for about the 
 last two months, so she finally caught me on my cell phone.  You know I 
 always keep my cell phone on when I'm away from the house and office.  The 
 number is 713-851-6240.  When I'm at church, the phone is off as well, but 
 anyother time, it's most always on.  And of course, my pager number is on my 
 business card.
 
 Anyway, please e-mail me back, if you're up an about.
 
 Talk with you soon.
