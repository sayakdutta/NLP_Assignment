 Since ETS has third party debt on it's books, the debt and cost of carry will 
 be excluded from the calculation so as not to double count.  
 
 Rick wants it to actualy be booked.  I lean towards just calculating it and 
 not actually make entries (I know that entries will cause all sorts of 
 additional issues).   Nothing has been formalized yet.

 What do we do with debt on the books of the entities?  Ignore it?   And my 
 understanding is that this will not be used for actual booking of anything  
 in the books,

 Over the last few months, we have been working on a new methodology to 
 measure and report business unit's retrurns on invested capital.   Several 
 different variations were considered, and I am glad to report that Skilling, 
 Causey and Fastow have approved the process outlined here.
 
 Simply stated (with an example shown below):  Return on equity will be 
 calculated based on a pre-determined debt/equity structure.  Business unit 
 capital will include both on-balance sheet and off-balance sheet uses of 
 capital and business unit's will be charged for the cost of their debt at 
 Enron's cost of funds.  Business unit's should focus on improving their 
 return on equity over time.

 This metric will not replace other targets (i.e., IBIT and Funds Flow).  
 
 We are currently working to overlay this approach to the submitted 2001 
 Plans.  If you have questions, please contact myself or Mike Deville.
