 checks it with Mark Haedicke to see if it's OK, which he won't do until he 
 gets back in town, which is in two weeks.  I hope that isn't going to cause 
 any problems...

 I actually received the last document I need to put otgether binders this 
 week.  Linda and I will compile closing binders with all the relevant 
 documents next week and send you one set for your files.  I will send copies 
 of the RBC documents to Rick at the same time.
 
 So, when are you going to come and enjoy our crisp weather?  Mark Taylor 
 e-mailed me saying he thought it was a good idea for you to come up here to 
 train Linda and Sharon.  It ain't Stampede, but at least Peter and I can 
 return the hospitality.
 
 
     
 Rick Borden at Macleod Dixon sent us a fax requesing copies of the documents 
 on the prepay.  Can you send him a copy?  Also, when they're all together, 
 can you send a copy to me for our files.  Thanks!
