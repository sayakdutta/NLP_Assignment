 I have completed my review of the revised Special Revisions my remarks are as 
 follows:
 
 We do not agree to the first paragraph.
 
 1. Agreed
 2. Agreed
 3. Agreed
 4. Agreed
 5. Agreed
 6. Agreed with change in wording.'
 7. Agreed
 8. Agreed to with exception of (ii).
 
 We do not agree to suggested addition of Sections 10.3 and 10.4.
 
 9 and 10.  Agreed
 11. Agreed
 12. Agreed
 13. We do not agree to this language.
 
 Because the Special Provisions are part of the agreement there is no need for 
 additional signature.
 
 Finally,  Enron perfers to be confirming party of all transactions.
 
 Please let me know how you would like to proceed.
