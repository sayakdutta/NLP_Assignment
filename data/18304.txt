 
 Thanks for the note.  We'll need to to discuss this a bit further, since it 
 could be a very sensitive issue for us (e.g., "Enron's answer to the 
 electricity crisis in municipalization).  If spun right, could provide an 
 interesting opportunity, however.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Gentlemen, 
 
 California State Senator Nell Soto (D-Ontario Dist.32) has authored SB 23 X 
 which is intended to streamline the formation of public power districts in 
 California.  
 
 Here is an opportunity for Enron to get involved and flex some muscle and win 
 on several fronts.  I think Enron is uniquely qualified to work with 
 municipalities to provide private labeled products or services that will 
 create a winning situation for all parties involved (including the IOUs).  
 
 I am extremely interested in working on such an effort and would very much 
 enjoy sharing my ideas in more detail at any time.  Please feel free to 
 contact me.
 
 Thanks all,
