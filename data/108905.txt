 Dear Admins,
 Please help!!
 In an effort to receive correct EPSC & EIS invoices for January, we need to 
 ensure that Joann Holloway has correct Cost Center and location information 
 for all employees in the various gas teams.  I am attaching a file with 
 employees and cost centers which was used by HR to make the "mass" change to 
 the new cost centers after the reorg.  I would appreciate each of your help 
 in dropping in Locations for each of the persons in the cost centers you are 
 responsible for.
 In addition, please check the position field for each person also, as I would 
 like to be sure I have correct information on a
 go forward basis.  I will then send this file to Joann Holloway for her use 
 in compiling invoices for January.
 
 The bad news is that she needs this quickly.  Please take the time to drop in 
 this information and return to me by 3:00 pm
 on Thursday, January 11.  I know this is short notice, but if we get it 
 correct from the beginning, it will be easier to maintain in the long run.
 
 Thanks in advance for your help!  Please let me know if you have any 
 questions.
