 Karen Jones in Portland has been working on it for ENA.  I don't know the 
 status.

 Hi, gang. Sheila called last Friday and let me know you were working on this 
 off-balance sheet EPC form, and that it was expected to be out on Friday, 
 maybe Monday for review and commment, which was needed PDQ becuase of a 
 looming project.  I have not seen any copy of the form or had any update on 
 the status of the project.
 
 Kay/Dave, could one of you send the form to me and let me know the big 
 picture status?
