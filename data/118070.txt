 
 Sorry to hear you're having computer problems.  I haven't gotten a virus yet 
 but I have had 2 hard drives crash and burn on me -- one at home and one at 
 the office -- you definitely loose everything when that happens!  My fairly 
 new work computer (the little one you saw at Christmas) started making 
 strange noises a couple of weeks ago so I called in the tech support guys.  
 They agreed that is sounded odd so they took everything off of my hard drive, 
 replaced it with a new one and then put all of my stuff back in the new one.  
 Took them a day or so but the weird noises are gone so I feel better.
 
 I'm off to San Antonio this week for a couple of days and then leave for 
 sailing on the 11th, returning on the 21st.  The last few days (18 - 21) I'll 
 be staying at a place called Keswick Hall in Virginia.  I may be able to send 
 that number before I leave.
 
 Love,
 
 Mark
