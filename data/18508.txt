 
 FYI:  Just got off the phone with Michael Hoffman, who's one of two key 
 outside financial advisors to Davis on the electricity crisis. The 
 administration is trying to get a legally binding agreement between the PUC 
 and DWR to ensure that the PUC doesn't muck around with the money (via 
 utility rates) DWR requires to be creditworthy.  They were shooting for this 
 Friday to have a draft of the document read for folks to review, but it now 
 looks like it won't get resolved until (at the earliest) next week----seems 
 that the one PUC lawyer who can actually do the work is on vacation.  Go 
 figure.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
