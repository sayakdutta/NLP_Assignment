 
 We want the letter on Doyle and New Albany ASAP.  Is there any reason we 
 would not do the joint defense agreement.

 Received this just now - will not reply until we have your thoughts.  Cle 
 Dade  had a thought about mentioning the existing New Albany - Doyle units in 
 our reply letter as well.  We are available at your convenience to discuss 
 the New Albany - Doyle turbine situation vis-a-vis Power Systems - Al

    Al,
 
 Our non-infringement opinion letters on the redesigned components have been 
 ready now for over one week.  I understood your client was anxious to receive 
 them, so we worked very hard to complete them as quickly as we could. 
 
 Please forward to me the executed Joint Defense Agreement so that I can 
 forward our non-infringement letters.
 
 Let me know if you have any questions.
 
 Trent
