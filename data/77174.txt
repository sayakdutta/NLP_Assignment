 
 Has anyone given any thought to the creation of a new company to enter into 
 the CRRA/Fuel Cell purchase/sale transactions?  Any names to suggest?  If 
 Enron is going to be the contractor as contemplated by the PDA, I would 
 expect to use a limited liablity company and not ENA.  
 
 Please advise.
