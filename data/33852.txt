 If it makes you feel better, I forward it to 2 other people!
 
 
     
 
 Hey, I think you are the only person that doesn't delete this right
 away.
 
     
                 
    Thank you!

    I've requested a prepayment for Wed in the amount of $42,000.00 due
 the
    rise in cash prices.  I've also added a new and exciting "Summary"
 tab
    to the worksheet.  That shows when the wires are made and my summary
    purchases for the month.  One thing I don't have access to is any
    information that identifies the wire.
 
    Jim, Pete, Shawn, let me know if you have anything you would like me
 to
    add to this worksheet and go ahead and hit Jim up for a free lunch.
    That's what I plan to do.
