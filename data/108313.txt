 Please let Nina know which of these days is best for your schedules ASAP and
 we will get back to you with the final decision.
 
 
     
 
 Lea,
 
 Gensler will be ready for a meeting with the Art Committee the week of Nov.
 6.  Bill is out of town on the 6th, but can do the afternoon (2 pm) of
 either the 7th or 8th.  What's your availability and do you want me to poll
 the rest of the group or will you?  Just let me know what I need to do.
 Thanks and have a great evening!.
 Nina

 Lea,
 
 We haven't forgotten you.  Bill has a meeting with Gensler tomorrow to
 discuss this.

 Bill,
 Any luck in scheduling a meeting with Gensler for the Art Committee to
 review their interior drawings?
