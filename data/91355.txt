 Thanks,

 Hello Torrey,
 	I examined past CIG deals and made code changes to allow default meter 991764500 when Enron sells physical gas.  Assuming deals continue to be sent as before, I have results of sample deals production which I tested with; see below.  Please test the changes at your earliest convenient.  Thanks.

 Hi Dat,
 
 As per Jay's request, is it possible to set the SITARA bridge to attach the following two default meter numbers to CIG Mainline deals, depending on whether they are buys or sales (from Enron's perspective)?
 
 Essentially, any deal in which Enron is the seller and the location is at Pipe "CIG" and trade zone "CENTRAL" should have a default meter number of 991764500, while any deal in which Enron is the buyer at the same location should go to meter number UNA-516938.
 
 Since the EOL mapping tables can only support one meter number per location, it would be necessary to set this logic up in the SITARA bridge itself. Is this doable from your end?

 I would like to have all sales of CIG Mainline next day physical gas to bridge over to Sitara under the following meter location:
 
 CIG/Mainline/991764500
 
 and all buys to 
 
 CIG/Mainline/UNA-516938
 
 Please let me know what effects (if any) this will have on the bridging process, Sitara, and confirmations.
 
 Thank you,
