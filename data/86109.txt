 
 The final sign off from Reliant legal.  I will prepare the executables and get them to Eva.  
 
  
    Cc:	Bradley, Ken A; Joyce, Michael
  
 The Bd resolutions and the post closing letter agmt are fine.  The Act
 of Sale contains 2 typos: 1) the Tax ID# for Reliant Energy Gas Storage,
 LLC is 76-0697568, 2) the 3 million number has one too many zeros after
 the decimal.  Otherwise, the doc is in order.
 
 
     
 
 Resending.  Thanks.
