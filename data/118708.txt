 Mark, Jeff, Jordan, Shari,
 
 Equity and Debt Trading would like to have an "exploratory" conversation to 
 consider the potential economic benefits/impact of offshore investing.  To 
 support an offshore investment fund we would need to have offshore originated 
 dollars.   Jeff Kinneman has suggested that we get individuals from 
 Accounting, Treasury, Tax and Legal with commercial for a initial discussion.
 
 We are trying to set up a meeting over the next two weeks to discuss.  Kelly 
 Templeton will be calling you to set up a meeting.  If another person is more 
 appropriate, please let me know or tell Kelly Templeton when she calls.
 
 Many thanks. 
 Sheila
