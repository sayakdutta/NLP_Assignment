 
 I think it is two separate documents, one for each purchaser (CAED I and CAED 
 II).

 Kay:
 
 Here is the information required for the Bill of Sale exhibit.   Let me know 
 if any additional information is needed and I will coordinate with Chris 
 Booth and Rebecca Walker.  I will draft an exhibit with this information in a 
 Word document as the formal attachment.  
 
 Does the Bill of Sale document require 2 separate exhibits (similar to the 
 notice of option exhibits) or can all the information be shown on one 
 exhibit?  Let me know.
