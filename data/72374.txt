 for the subs worked out.  Come see me whenever you want.
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
   
  
 Just wanted you to know that Ann Elizabeth is freaking out about Ben's POA 
 not being executed yet and I think she is going to talk to you about it.  I 
 told her that you and I were working on it but that it just kind of got 
 pushed down in the priority.  I personally do not think it is a big deal (but 
 she sure does).
 
 Also, since Matt is taking Deb Korkmas' place I am going to give him a list 
 of companies and people we want to be listed as officers.  I'll send you, 
 Carlos and Ann Elizabeth a draft list soon so we can decide who we want (may 
 be like the officers listed on Merchant Ventures)
