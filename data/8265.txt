 
 I was really looking for the list of attendees to see we wanted to share rides to Neiman's.  Can you get that list form Vanessa?  Thanks. 
 
     
 Enron has purchased a table to the 2001 Houston Chronicle Best Dressed Luncheon & Neiman Marcus Fashion Show benefiting the March of Dimes.  The luncheon will be held on Wednesday, April 11 at the Westin Galleria.  The reception begins at 11:30 a.m., and the actual luncheon starts promptly at 12:00 noon.

 Vanessa, would you please resend Sally the memo regarding the luncheon?  It looks like I've deleted my copy.
 
 Thank you!
 
 Kathy
