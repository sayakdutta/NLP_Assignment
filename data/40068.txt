 Mark, is this what you were working on at one point?  Maybe it should go to Sally Beck, but I'm not sure.

 Ken,
 
 I don't know if you are the right person for this - but I thought that someone should register Enron in the new domain(s) asap before we lose them.
 
 Although I am in IT, I am not really in the right area and neither is my direct chain of command (although I think they are just great to work for)

 Sorry to have troubled you, but I KNOW that if I mention it, then you will get it to the right person for consideration.
 
 Many thanks
