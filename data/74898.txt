 
 I cleared not going to Atlanta with Elizabeth, so I should be able to take 
 Michael to Palacios as soon as Monday.  Supposed to rain this weekend anyway, 
 so Monday is soon enough. I would just as soon not have a Sharon appointment 
 so we have that flexibility.  Plus, there is the possibility that I might 
 need to go to FW for my dad.  Michael can go to FW with me if I need to go - 
 he would be great company for me. I've thought about taking  him to Moody 
 Gardens, or do some other fun stuff as an alternative.   The long term 
 weather forecast for Houston and Palacios is glorious for that week, but you 
 never know.  I don't mind taking him by myself.  I can do most of the fishing 
 stuff, although I don't know squat about artificials.  If I do go I would 
 like to take Rosco.  Since my folks have an internet connection I can keep up 
 with a little work and write you, too.  
 
 What do you think?

 Neil,
 
 I will  be out of the office Wednesday and unable to receive e-mail
 regarding therapy on Monday 3/19.  Please call the office and leave a
 message if you will or will not be coming on Monday.  Thanks.
