 
 As part of the modelling process, Marc is going to meet with James Scribner 
 on Tuesday morning at 9:00 am to review our operations pricing model.  If you 
 can join them, you might find it interesting.  They plan to meet in James' 
 office - EB3756.  --Sally

 As a follow-up to our brief conversation earlier - 
 
 Sally has enlisted the assistance of Marc Eichmann to build a revenue model 
 for the Back Office Commercialization.  To prepare for that, Sally, myself, 
 and James Scribner are meeting tomorrow to start to put together the 
 assumptions and detailed information that Marc will need to build the model.  
 We thought that you could probably offer some valuable insight to this 
 process, so we would like for you to attend if you can.
 
 We will be meeting in Sally's office - 3389, on Tuesday from 1:00 p.m. to 
 3:00 p.m.
 
 See you there!
