 
 Tiny,
 
 Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to come to Houston to attend this.  TW is assured the best success when all key departments are part of the strategy.  I have always appreciated your input and your enthusiasm for success.
 
 Thanks, Kim.
 
  
     
 Just a quick note of appreciation for the invite to this Team Building session..    It won't mean much coming from an Advisor way out on the West end of TW, but none the less, you are both to be commended for putting this togeather.  I went through the same Personality Profile with all the Teams on the West End when I started this advisor thing, and going through it again reminded me of some of my interpersonal skills that need immediate attention.  
 
 Oh yea, I don't know if either of you are interested or familiar with the Zenger Miller Team building training sessions that are offered through ETS.  Most of the advisors are certified facilitators and a variety of team building topics are available.  I'm not the best at facilitating these sessions but, I can certainly point you all in the right direction if there is an interest or we can provide a list of the various topics and course details....   (4 to 8 hours courses typically)  Anyhow, thanks again and have a good week....
