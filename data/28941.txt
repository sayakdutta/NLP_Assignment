 Mr. Fossum,
 
 Just today I discovered that Enron NNG recently advertised an attorney job
 vacancy in Omaha.  My wife and I are native "Omahans" and wish to return to
 the area.  Out of hope that you have not yet filled the position, I am
 attaching a cover letter and a resume for your consideration.
 
 Thank you for any consideration you might extend me.
