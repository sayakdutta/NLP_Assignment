 
 I didn't get a response from you regarding my e:mail that I sent last week, 
 but I have heard through the grapevine that you will be making a trip to 
 Houston next week.  My plans for being in London next week are firm, so it 
 looks as if we will miss one another.  
 
 My offer stands to help you in any way as you take on your new role, so I 
 trust that you will take me up on that offer as needed.  I will look forward 
 to working with you as we develop common standards for operations worldwide, 
 with effective exception reporting.  This is a key initiative for 2000 and 
 will involve trading operations in all locations for all commodities.
