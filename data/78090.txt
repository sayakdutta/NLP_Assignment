 
 Looks fine to me.  Will you accept the changes and send out?  I would like to 
 receive a  bcc of whatever goes out, if possible.
 
 Thanks,

 Kay:
 
 Attached is your draft of the LOI with revisions from the origination team.  
 Please call me with any questions at x37590 or on my mobile at 713.303.4583.  
 As we discussed, we would like to have something ready to send to the 
 counterparty by the end of today.
 
 Thanks-
 Bill
