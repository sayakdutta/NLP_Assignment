 An estimate works fine for the ERC.  As far as I know the site that usually posts results, www.runnertriathletenews.com only posted the top 3 spots in each age group.
 
  
     
 I have no idea what my finish time was.  It was somewhere in the 32:00 range....is there a website that I can look this up at? Thanks.
