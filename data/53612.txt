 Dear Mr.Kaminski,
 
 I have found the EnronOnline project a very interesting one and have enjoyed
 working with everyone in the Research department as well as those from other
 departments. I am keenly interested in this area and was wondering if there
 would be any summer internship opportunities. I have attached my resume to
 this mail for your review and look forward to hearing from you soon.
 
 Thank you
