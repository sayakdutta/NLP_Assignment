 know how much fun a night in the airport can be.  I'd be happy to talk about 
 the US commodity laws at one of our group meetings.  I'm going to be in 
 London the last week of this month - maybe we can set something up for then?

 I've been thinking about what we could cover at our London trading meeting 
 every Tuesday and thought it would be a good idea if we could get you to give 
 the group a 15-20 minute overview of US commodities law. I think this would 
 be particularly helpful for our newest members, Robert Quick and Mark 
 Elliott. Please let me know what you think. Thanks!
