 Faced with horrible polling, an unwilling legislature, an uncooperative California PUC, and a wily leader of the state Senate (Burton), Davis is now considering delaying any action to call back the legislature.
 Rumors of a delay come despite Davis' statements that he would call them back next week.
 We received the information about a likely delay from an Edison SVP who's working with administration staff to come up with a deal that the legislature can finally swallow.
 It's Edison's view that the earliest Davis would now call the legislature back is end of next week, with early the following week being most likely.
 At this point, the chance remains that Davis may be forced to throw up his hands and call the whole thing off, leaving Edison to follow PG&E into chapter 11.
 In the meantime, negotiations between Davis' staff, and staff from the Senate and Assembly continue.
 
 We'll report back with information as we get it.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
