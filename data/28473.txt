 the org. charts etc. to reflect this?  DF  
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
   
  
 Question:
 Under the Standards of Conduct for Northern, Section III ("Merchant 
 Function"), Paragraph 284.286(a), last sentence reads "The Pipeline Sales 
 Division reports to the President of Northern."  We all know that this is now 
 Dan McCarty.  However, whereas Bill Cordes' title was 'President', every 
 announcement about Dan refers to him as 'Managing Director and Chief 
 Commercial Officer for ETS'.  Does the word "president" exist anywhere in 
 Dan's job description so as to make this sentence imply the presidency role 
 rather than inferring it?
