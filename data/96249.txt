 
 After looking at this I realize it may not be as helpful as I thought - 
 certainly would need to add more analysis on the delivery obligations like FM 
 and other rights to interrupt.  Call if you have any questions (713 853 6349).
 
 ps  if you get a chance I would love to see the form PGE used in addition to 
 the WSPP - I think you said it was PGE 11.
 
 Thanks
 Have a great weekend.
