 few hotties in Houston/Texas is that travel and exposure add such an 
 intangible element to a person and very few Texas girls have experienced 
 either.
 
         I think everyone has a different definition of good, some more 
 lenient some more stringent.  At least that has been my experience.

 good to see your not to pist off at my NY attitude and my dicking around last 
 night.
 I was just busting balls for the hell of it..cause some of these texans are 
 complitely uncultured .....makes me laugh.
 And no all girls are not FAT in Houston...but there are not that many hotties 
 Vs. the great cities of the world.
 It was fun though and i value your good humour and attitude. 
 
 How to define a good girl.....or rather how do we define "good"
