 
 The world is treating me ok.  It's just that I can't stop losing money.  It 
 hasn't been a very good start to my trading life.  What is going on in your 
 world?  I hope to make it out to the house sometime soon.
 
 Love, Eric
 
 
 
 

    
 
 
 Hi son: how is the world treating you? Saw that gas prices were down 
 significantly yesterday. Hope you maintained your short position. Say hello 
 to Shana. Let me hear from you. Love-Dad
