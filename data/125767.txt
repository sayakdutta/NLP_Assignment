 Today marks the completion of the 2 week commissioning period for ADMS.
 Effective October 26th at 16:00 the System Controllers will no longer follow
 up ADMS dispatches with a voice confirmation unless a ADMS message has timed
 out because of technical difficulties or the System Controllers have been
 notified that a participant is having technical difficulties receiving ADMS
 dispatches and directives.
 
 The time out period will be adjusted from the 10 minutes to 5 minutes. We
 intend to further reduce the time out to 2 minutes following a reasonable
 delay and reassessment based on our operating experience.
 
 We are currently reevaluating the ADMS dispatch procedures with regards to
 the Interconnections. Any changes to the Interconnection procedures will be
 conveyed to participants well in advance of implementation.
 
 Thanks to all of you for your patience during our implementation of this
 valuable new tool.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Don Adair
 Manager, System Coordination Center
