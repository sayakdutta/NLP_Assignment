 
 Good Morning,
 
 So, you've been thinking about me!  I like to see that....  I don't have one of those pagers.  I went to the game yesterday and I didn't go back to the office.  Boy do we stink, kind of like UT!  Anyway, what time do you get in to H-town?  Have a safe trip!

 So no messages from you all day long. Out of sight, out of mind I guess.
