 
 Mo,
 
 Hey, glad to know you are recovering swiftly from Friday nights festivities.  I think I just might have finally kicked my hangover.  Joe said he woke up early Saturday morning to find me passed out in my clothes face down on the couch with the cat snuggling up against me.  As exhausted as I was, I had to meet keith at the office Sat. and then went to a party Sat night where some asshole at the party backed into my car and didn't even come in and tell me!  Now I have to play detective to find out who did it.  Anyway, I had a great time hanging out Friday night and I'm glad you did too.  Hope to see you around soon.  Give me a call if you're going to be around anytime.

 Susan and I are suffering from extreme neck pain this weekend from 
 overenthusiastic dancing to "Nookie" at the Swan.  Just wanted to say thanks 
 for hanging out, I really had a good time.  I didn't think I was going to 
 get my second wind after dinner but I was pleasantly suprised.  I had a 
 monster hangover on Saturday and did not get out of pj's until 4pm..it was 
 pathetic.  But I had a great time and its only fitting that I get sloshed on 
 my last day.  Take care and catch you sometime at the FP or Lil W.
 Mo.
