 
 Greetings.  I have a conflict in the morning, but could join by conference 
 calling beginning at 2 pm.  Is that possible.  If not, no big deal.  I, like 
 Ralph, will catch up at the next meeting, and submit our ideas to Eve between 
 now and then.  Let me know.  And I agree with Ralph re: staying focused on 
 the most urgent issues.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Colleagues:  it turns out that at this hour I will be presiding over hearings 
 in
 Wyoming on the disposal of wastes from nuclear weapons (your condolences are
 gratefully accepted).  I hope to join the next meeting, whenever it is.  My
 advice remains what I said at our Dec. 1 meeting:  let's try to help the
 legislature stay focused for now on the most urgent electricity issues that
 absolutely must be addressed now:  forward contracting in the wholesale 
 markets
 to reduce customers' exposure to very high and volatile wholesale prices, and 
 a
 rate stabilization plan to deal with the issues surrounding this year's
 wholesale costs.  If we can help narrow the immediate issues to those, and 
 frame
 the differences and decisions that remain, we'll have made a useful
 contribution.
