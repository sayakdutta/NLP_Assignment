 Vince,
 ?
 Hi, hope you are well.
 ?
 I'm just dropping a note regarding invoice 215 which was for 5 people  
 attending the energy and weather course.? Our records show that it hasn't  
 been paid, which is good.? We will re-do the invoice and charge you only  for 
 Alex and Tom's attendance since Paulo didn't show.? Is this OK with  you?? By 
 the way, we only charged $250 a person for the weather course  since it was 
 suppose to be an exchange of information session, and Enron Weather  paid for 
 the venue.
 ?
 Nice to have finally met you in Houston!
