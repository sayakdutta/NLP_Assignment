 
 Thanks for the "words of encouragement".  I just sent an e-mail to my Human 
 Resources Rep and will wait to get a response.  I am so READY!!.  I've set up 
 a meeting with my financial advisor for tomorrow to go over things again 
 since I really have made up my mind.  
 
 Talk with you tonight!
