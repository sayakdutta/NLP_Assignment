 
 Thanks.  
 
 We'll call you around 100.

 I'm actually back in the office, so I'm available for the call.
 
 Sorry to hear about your dad.
 
 
     
 
 
 As best I can tell it isn't essential; however, it would probably be
 helpful.  I know you are on holiday, so if you have something else going
 on, I wouldn't worry about it.  I can always call you later.
