 I came across this web site and knew you would enjoy it... 
  
 It's called realFamilies and has really interesting articles about parenting and marriage. You can check them out at http://www.realfamilies.com
 
 It features a funny and insightful psychologist named Dr. Kevin Leman, and he also has a TV show that you can watch online too.
