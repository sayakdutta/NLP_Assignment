 
 Okay, that makes more sense. I've left a big note on Sean's desk and I'm 
 watching the door of the meeting for him to come out.

 yes- so this is what prebon is saying on this deal 549052:
 Enron buys from Pacificorp 25 mw of peak BOM Mid-C at $141.00
 
 Thanks!!
 
 
 
 
 

 
   
  
 Sean Crandall said the price on this is correct (241), but he thought the 
 deal was supposed to run through the end of the month. He was just walking 
 into a meeting with Tim Belden while I was trying to figure this out with 
 him, and he asked that I not change anything until he gets out and can look 
 at it more closely. A price of $141 is awfully low for a peak deal flowing at 
 Mid-C tomorrow - actually lower than the off-peak prices - so it sounds a 
 little suspicious. I'll let you know when he gets out of the meeting.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate

 549052 - del. point is already in as Mid-C, so just the price is wrong?
