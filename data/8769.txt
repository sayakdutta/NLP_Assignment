 Portland risk group regarding this slip up.  What assurances have you gotten 
 from them about their diligence in the future in officializing books?  Do you 
 think that everyone there is on board and aware of how important this is?

 I just wanted to let you know that the West Risk Management group did not 
 officialize one of their calculations last night.  I have had calls from 
 Credit & VAR.  The Interest Rate group was not affected because their new 
 system caught the error and the were able to use yesterday's cash flows.  I 
 officialized the book this morning and everyone is rerunning their 
 applications.  I'll let you know if there is any other fall out.
