 
 Thanks, I appreciate it!  What should I do with the Japanese counterparty on 
 the 9/26/00 list?  Shut them down for all trading on Japan based products 
 until I hear from you?  Will you be coming to the Legal Conference here in 
 Houston next week?  Maybe we could chat then?!

 It appears that we have now opened up our first Japan based financial product 
 on EnronOnline, and I need to get some direction from you as to what 
 restrictions, if any, we have on (1) counterparties located/incorporated in 
 Japan trading Japan based financial products, and (2) counterparties not 
 located in Japan trading Japan based financial products.
 
 Previously, the only Japanese financial product we had was weather, but it 
 wasn't being sold by a Japan based Enron company, so my understanding was 
 that I didn't have any particular restrictions under Japanese law for 
 counterparties located in or outside Japan in trading this product.  Now that 
 the product is being sold by a Japan based company I am wondering was 
 restrictions I might have to keep in mind when doing my daily online 
 approvals.
 
 The only are Japan based direction I am getting is from the Broadband legal 
 team (Robbi Rossi) which have told me Japanese counterparties can only trade 
 US bandwidth segments.
 
 P.S. we do have a Japanese counterparty on the 9/26/00 list.
