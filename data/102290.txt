 
 Hi Lindy.  Sorry I've not yet set up the meeting on imbalances...I feel I am 
 still lacking focus so thought I'd run this by you for your comments before 
 inviting people.   
  
 First of all, I believe the general topics we wanted to address were:
 
 - imbalance netting & trading
 - mandatory use of Park N Ride service for out of balance operators
 - hourly determination of imbalances
 
 Is this correct?
 
 Next, the list of attendees:  you, me, Darrell, Richard Hanagriff, Sheila 
 Nacey (or someone else she designates).  Anyone else?
 
 As far as timing, I am very flexible, so let me know what works for you, and 
 I'll get it set up.
