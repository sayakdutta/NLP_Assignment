 Errol,
 
 We are trying to make sure that everyone that is trading options with us off 
 line are aware that we have both GD and Price Options on EOL.  Do you have a 
 list of companies that are trading with us? If not a post ID would suffice.  
 I still have some queries that I can run from my risk days.  Thanks for your 
 help.
