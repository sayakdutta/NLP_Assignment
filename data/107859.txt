 I am in the process of updating the quarterly report that is provided to the 
 Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors which details Executive 
 Committee member stock holdings.
 
 Please provide me your current personal ENE stock holdings as of 12/31/00.
 
 Such holdings include:
 shares held in a family trust
 your personal brokerage account
 in certificate form
 in an IRA
 etc.
 
 Such holdings do NOT include any shares held in connection with Company plans 
 (i.e., ESOP, savings plans, phantom shares, option grants, or restricted 
 stock grants), although shares acquired that are held free-and-clear should 
 be included.
 
 Please contact me if you have any questions or require further information 
 (713-345-8085)
 
 I appreciate your response
 
 Mary
