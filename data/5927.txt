 Come talk to me when your team can score more than 33 points in a game.  
 LSU's basketball dynasty is officially over.  Oh, wait a minute.  It never 
 began.  
 
 
 
 
 Mississippi 50, LSU 33
 		
  
 OXFORD, Miss. (AP) _ Aaron Harper scored 16 points to lead No. 25 Mississippi 
 to a 50-33 victory over Louisiana State on Wednesday night. 
 Harper was the only player in double figures for the Rebels (18-4, 6-3 
 Southeastern Conference), who won their fourth consecutive game exactly one 
 year after their worst home loss in 40 years _ a 97-53 loss to LSU. 
 Roland Dupree had 14 points and a game-high 11 rebounds for LSU (11-9, 1-8), 
 which was held to fewer than 40 points for the first time since a 51-39 loss 
 at Rice in 1948. 
 The Rebels limited the Tigers to 12-of-43 shooting from the field and forced 
 them into 25 turnovers. 
 LSU also shot just 1-of-16 from 3-point range, but stayed close before the 
 Rebels put it away with a decisive 19-4 run. 
 LSU led only once, on Dupree's opening basket. Ole Miss answered with a 12-5 
 run and never trailed again. Harper made three consecutive baskets to 
 highlight the surge. 
 The Rebels led 19-15 at halftime, but LSU pulled within 23-22 with 15:19 
 remaining on a basket by Jermaine Williams. LSU never got any closer as Ole 
 Miss went on its decisive 19-4 run in the next seven minutes. Harper sparked 
 the surge with a pair of 3-pointers and two assists. 
 LSU's DuPree got a technical foul during the run, following his protest of an 
 offensive foul by teammate Torris Bright. 
 Jason Harrison hit both technical foul free throws and Harper followed with a 
 3-pointer to complete the run and give Ole Miss a 42-26 lead with 7:23 left.
