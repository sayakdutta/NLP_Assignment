 Apparently the recruiter spoke to one of my son's  roommates and left a phone 
 number (713) 343-3214 which he tried several times  and got busy signals. 
 Today she called just before you called me and left her  cellphone number but 
 he was in classes all morning and got the message in the  afternoon. I really 
 appreciate your going out of your?way to help. Perhaps  there will be another 
 opportunity.?
