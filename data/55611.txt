 Vince and Ken,
 
 Please see note below.  Rice's president is planning to attend the 
 presentation and dinner!  I'll let you know when I hear from Gil (Dean 
 Whitaker).  Thanks!
 
 Also, please remember that I've scheduled Steve Kean for lunch (I'll have 
 Melinda have lunches brought to the conference room). Please let me know the 
 exact room number and the exact number of lunches needed from your end.
 
 Thanks!
 
 --Christie.
