 I left a msg in your voice mail, but the low down is that the ENE/AC Flag 
 Football tourney is Saturday and we would like you to play.  The tourney 
 starts at 10 and is 3 hours long.  If we win, we get 16 tickets to the game 
 (2 for each of us).  Let me know if you are interested.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Eric

 Hope all is well.  Is this in reference to the Enron/Andersen Consulting 
 football game?  When is it?  Do you need me to play?  Give me a call and we 
 can discuss (3-9557).  
 
 Thanks,
 
 Paul

 I know I might seem a little obsessed with this, but here are some of our 
 plays from our flag football league.  There are plays on both tabs.
 I was thinking that we would start with me at left flanker, Paul Broderick at 
 center, Paul Burkhart at right slot, Steve at right flanker, Sarah at 
 blocker, and either Mike or Chris at blocker.  Let me know if you have 
 objections.  Also, I am sending this to Paul Burkhart so I am assuming that 
 he will play (P. Broderick can you confirm this?).
 
 Steve - if you have some plays from your team that you think might work let 
 me know.
 
 Let me know what you think.
 
 Hook 'Em!
 -Eric
