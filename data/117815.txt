 not giving advice with respect to futures contracts (valuations or trading 
 advice) or handling customer funds there should not be any Commodity Exchange 
 Act issues.

 Mark, the business people posted at ECTRIC's office in Stockholm want to 
 offer a Swedish forestry group portfolio management services and advisory 
 services.  With reference to our previous conversations on the subject below, 
 do you think that this may entail problems under US securities laws?!

 Mark:
 
 Did you have any luck with your New York law firm contact.   The other party 
 has accepted the contents of the contract and wish to sign on Tuesday next 
 week, why it's a bit urgent to flag any US securities law implications 
 associated with the relevant transaction.
