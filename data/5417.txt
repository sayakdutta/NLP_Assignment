 
 hey dad,
  
 austin was fun.  michael ballases and i went up for the day and met up with his family b/c it was parent's weekend.  it was good to see them again.  i am anxious to see how we play against OU.  i am starting to have a good feeling about this team. they looked really sharp on saturday - especially the offense.  
  
 shanna and i will come out for jason's b-day on wednesday. i don't know what time yet but it should be around 6:30.
  
 see ya then
 
 
     
 
 God afternoon, Son:
  
  How was the Austin trip? I suspect you had a good time. You are now out of my alma maters to beat up on. I thought the tee sips looked good. Don't know how much of that was because they were playing a week sister. Hard to tell what kind of team Tech has, but they did not look good Sat. I suspect we will know a lot more about the quality of team TU has by this time next week.
  You guys coming over on Wed. for Jason's birthday? Hope to se you then. Have a good one. Love-Dad
