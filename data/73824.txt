 Attached is the latest version of the draft term sheet sent out last Friday.  
 It incorporates the comments of Greg Penmann.  I have also filled in some of 
 the blanks on the following issues:
  1.  Delay LD ($ amounts and caps)
  2.  Availability %'s, penalties & bonuses ($ amounts and caps)
  3.  ComEd schedule change limitations
  4.  Project Update section - removal of Event of Default language
  5.  Early completion bonus ($ amount and cap)
 
 Please review this ComEd term sheet and forward me any additional comments.
 
 I am forwarding a copy of this term sheet to Kay Mann for her review.  I left 
 her a voicemail letting her know that this term sheet format was developed 
 earlier this year with legal input from Stuart Zisman.
 
 I would like to be a position to send this term sheet to ComEd sometime 
 tomorrow (8/29).  
 
 This document should also serve as a template for the term sheet which I will 
 be preparing to send to the wholesale energy group at Wisconsin Electric 
 regarding a PPA from the Plano site.  I would like to have that document 
 ready by Wednesday-Thursday of this week.  I will send you the first version 
 of this WEPCO document either later today or tomorrow morning.
 
 Call/see me to discuss any of this information.
 
 Fred
