 Gentlemen,
 
  Spoke to Vince K today and asked if he would send Stinson Gibner to Sidney 
 to be available on Monday to review the X system.
 Paul, make sure our X friends are available and the Confidentially Agreement 
 is signed.  Further, I spoke to Phillip B. about a technical going too.
 
 G'day mates,
 
 Gary
