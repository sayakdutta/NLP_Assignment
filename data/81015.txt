 
 Philippe,
 
 I did talk to Skilling about this.  I must have forgotten to call you.  Jeff 
 really does want it around, you were correct.  Is there a compromise solution 
 here?  Maybe a smaller room with a control center vs an entire floor?  Think 
 about items like that and lets discuss.  At this point in time, lets not 
 assume we have the option to move it from the new building, at least not all 
 of it.  One key consideration is the cost savings by moving it to Ardmore.  
 How much will it really save?  Those numbers a long with all the other points 
 might bring clarity to what we should do.
 
 Thanks,
 Mike

 Mike,
 
 Jenny and I have been thinking about the new building, I want to minimise the 
 amount of space dedicated to a data center Skilling is (from what
 Bill Donovan says) keen to have a state of the art data center that he can 
 take visitors to. I think that given our notorious inability to plan for 
 space 
 at this company (We are out of space in London already 18months ahead of 
 schedule), I would like to convince Jeff not to have a large DC in 
 the new building and add to Ardmore which would on a per square foot basis be 
 significantly cheaper we would have the added benefit  of having
 an extra floor available in the new building!
 
 I think this is the best thing to do for Enron.
 
 
 Let me know what you think
 
 Philippe
