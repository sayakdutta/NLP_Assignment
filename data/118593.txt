 Mark - 
 
 Last week Dale Neuner was requested to add four new commodities to on-line 
 trading and Mike Robison and Steve Elliott have reviewed and approved the 
 long descriptions for benzene, mixed xylene, toluene and methanol.   We have 
 also finalized the form of GTC's for EPC (who trades benzene, xylene and 
 toluene) and are forwarding them to you for further distribution.
 
  
 
 Note:  GTC's for Enron Clean Fuels Company (who trades methanol) will follow 
 on Wednesday.
 
 Thanks.
