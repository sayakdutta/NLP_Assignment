 
 	Merci!
 
  
     
 Sure.  
 
  
     
 	Iris,
 
 		Thanks for the message. If it's not too much trouble, I would very much appreciate a printed report showing how much time I have left. Thanks.
 
  
     
 FYI (if you don't already know this)
 
 I don't keep close watch of each and everyone's time.  That is, in the sense that I know how much vacation each of you has left this year.  I can print reports so you can keep up with it, but I don't police everyone's time that closely.  Just wanted everyone to know so if you loose some vacation, it will be your fault.
 
 Let me know when you want another printout before year end.
 
 I  :o)
