 Debra,
 As discussed on 9/19, the e-mail below and attached documents reflect the
 final status of the GISB/netting.  I'd like to get this wrapped up and
 signed within the next 2 weeks, if humanly possible.  Let me know where we
 stand.
 Sarai

 Debra,
 Now that we have the Master Firm Agreement nearly signed off on, I'd like
 to get the GISB and netting agreements in place as well.  Attached below
 are the GISB cover page and Special Provisions that my records reflect we
 last agreed to.  I'd like to see Enron's new netting agreement because the
 netting agreement previously sent to MW is a year old.  If you have no
 changes to the GISB cover page and SP, we should nearly be caught up.  I
 look forward to receiving the netting agreement from you.  Thanks.
