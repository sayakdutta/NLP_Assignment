 date.  
 
 
 
 

    
 
 HI, Sal.  You ARE correct:  we would be coming the weekend of the 17th/18th.
 We'll leave Austin noonish on Saturday (I have a rowing lesson Saturday
 morning!) and probably leave Houston mid-afternoon on Sunday.  Glad it still
 works for you.   We'll look forward to seeing you guys and the new digs.
 Love, C.
