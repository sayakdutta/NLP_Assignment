 Dear, Mr. Lay:
 
 I have taken the liberty of submitting your name as reference to
 the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. I am part of a team
 which is bidding to manage a $350 million OPIC African
 Infrastructure Fund. I will serve as the Managing General Partner
 of the fund.
 
 A representative of OPIC will be calling you over the next
 several days to ask you about my personal character and my
 business experience, as you are familiar with them.
 
 I would appreciate it if you would accept the call from OPIC.
 
 Thank you very much,
 
 Frank Savage
