 Vacation???  I've heard that tomorrow at the staff meeting Mark H. will be 
 rolling out the new policy of eliminating all vacation for ENA legal folks.

 Lets continue without Kay.  I think this call will be focusing on the 
 documents sent out already.

 Kay will be on vacation Thursday and Friday.  Can the call go on without 
 her?  Same time, 1:30 p.m. CDT?  Let me know please.

 lets make the change- GE cannot make it wednesday- plus the extra day gives 
 both GE and us time to review the exhibits and the new T&C draft.  given that 
 Sheila is in her "hostage situation", the other key person is Kay.   Thanks.

 John, I'm not going to change the call to Thursday until I hear from you to 
 make sure you guys want it that way.  Thanks, Suzanne

 Changing to Thursday works better for Scott Dieball, John Rigby and Peter 
 Thompson.
