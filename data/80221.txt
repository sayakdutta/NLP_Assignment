 Thanks for the email.  I enjoyed the evening in Norman as well.  I also enjoyed the game vs KSU.
 
 Your resume looks very impressive.  I would continue to work through the university and make sure that you get on the interview schedule when we come back up.
 
 I'll hold on to your resume and pass it on to people in the pipeline group that may be looking for an intern.
 
 Best of luck,
 
 Mark
 
 
 
 
     
 
 Hello Mr. McConnell,
 This is Jonathan Milton at the University of Oklahoma.  I had the pleasure of 
 meeting you last Thursday with the JCPenny Leadership program.  I enjoyed 
 hearing about your company and I am very excited about the internship 
 opportunities Enron offers in sales and marketing.  I have attached a copy of 
 my resume and I look forward to hearing from you!
 
 Jonathan Milton
