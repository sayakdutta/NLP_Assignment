 > 	Here is a summary of what we discussed with respect to EES.
 >
 > 1.	EES will take its oldest backup tape as a snapshot of the email
 > system as it then existed.  EES will not be making daily backups of the
 > email system.  (This would involve about 7 tapes per day.)  Thus, current
 > business email will not be kept for EES unless there is a business reason
 > to do so.
 >
 > 2.	EES will take its oldest backup tape of data for its file servers as
 > a snapshop of the data that existed at that time.  EES will not be making
 > any other backups of file server data other than they normally would in
 > the ordinary course of business
 >
 > 3.	EES will not be taking copies or mirror images of the 300 employees
 > hard drives and any associated floppy disks at this time.  Employees will
 > continue to use their equipment as they normally would.
 >
 > 4.	If you need additional data preservation regarding EES other than as
 > described above, you will let me know.
 >
 > Please let me know if this summary is not accurate.
