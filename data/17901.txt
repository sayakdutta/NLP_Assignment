 
 Greetings:
 
 Sue Landwehr will be sending around a more comprehensive summary of what 
 happened at today's FERC hearnig in Boise but asked me to pass along the 
 following.
 
 Each state was only allowed to have two people at the table.  For California 
 it was Assembly Speaker Hertzberg and Geoff Brown (newly appointed CA PUC 
 Commissioner).  
 
 Hertzberg did a credible, matter-of-fact job of explaining what California's 
 doing to resolve the crisis (nice to know that there's someone out there who 
 can explain what the heck California's doing).  Hertzberg then asked that 
 FERC do "its part" by imposing price caps in Western wholesale markets.
 
 Hertzberg didn't mention the PG&E bankruptcy or Davis' deal with Edison.
 
 Overall, the "no price cap" message won the day (though Breathitt seems to be 
 under considerable pressure to give in to caps).
 
 The Governor of Arizona (Jane Hull) had a staffer deliver a letter signed by 
 9 republicant governors opposing price caps.  Sue will be distributing the 
 letter.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
