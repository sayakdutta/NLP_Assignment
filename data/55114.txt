 
 Stinson,
 
 No problem. I shall forward the letter to HR
 to enter this information into the company's records.
 
 I hope you will have good time and come back with fresh dose
 of energy.

 Vince,
 
 After eight years of working for Enron, I would like to take some additional 
 time off.   If possible, I would like to take three weeks of leave without 
 pay, beginning September 25 and continuing through October 13th, 2000.
 
 Thank you,
 
 Stinson Gibner
