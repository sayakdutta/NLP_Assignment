 
 I wanted to extend my thanks in advance to all of you who will join me in the 
 office on January 1, 2000.  I appreciate your willingness to devote part of 
 your holiday weekend to the continuing success story at Enron.  
 
 As a company, Enron has spent much time and effort to ensure that business 
 will continue smoothly as we move into the year 2000.  Ken Walther, in 
 working with many of you, has done an excellent job of preparing a work plan 
 for January 1.    Your  work on the first  will be the final step in this 
 process.  Your efforts that day will allow all ENA employees to return to the 
 office on January 4th with confidence in our ability to continue business as 
 usual.  
 
 I wish each one of you a happy new year.  I continually feel privileged to 
 work with this dedicated and talented group of  employees.  I look forward to 
 all that we will accomplish in 2000.
