 Attached are the revised Proposal Sheets and Exhibit A thereto that I have 
 initialled and given today to  Lisa Mellencamp. Also included are copies 
 marked to show changes to the versions you forwarded me this am. Re your 
 voice mail this afternoon, I understood the 6% dividend rate in the memo 
 asset description was calculated by someone in your group from data in the 
 Stock Purchase Agreement ( I did not independently make the calculation), and 
 that you may want to delete the reference in any case. I went ahead and 
 returned the attached to Lisa Mellencamp without waiting for your response as 
 they are trying to get these all in today, but if the 6% should come out, I 
 can rerun the Proposal Sheet to delete it, or if it is correct or otherwise 
 is immaterial, we can leave the Proposals alone on that point. Let me and 
 Lisa Mellencamp know if you have any other questions or comments on the 
 copies of the Proposal Sheets and Exhibit A thereto delivered to Lisa earlier 
 today.

 Due to options outstanding for Catalytica that have a separate value from the 
 preferred shares that we already carry, we have created two Raptor proposal 
 sheets for the assets.  One for the Catalytica options and one for the 
 preferred shares.
 
 Please review the following documents and let me know if you have any 
 questions.
