 The WSPP operating/contract drafting committee is meeting on October 7 in
 Phoenix to discuss the reserve requirements for firm sales.  I would 
 appreciate
 your review and comments on the following as a definition for Firm Power for 
 use
 in the WSPP Agreement in lieu of the current language.  This language would be
 inserted in Schedule C and replace Sections C-3.3 and C-3.6:
 
      Firm Power shall be interrupted only if the interruption is: (a) due to 
 an
      Uncontrollable Force as provided in Section 10 of this Agreement and 
 power
      is not available at the Delivery Point; or, (b) where applicable, to meet
      Seller's public utility or statutory obligations to its customers.  If
      Seller exercises its right to interrupt to meet its public utility or
      statutory obligations, Seller shall be responsible for payment of damages
      for failure to deliver Firm Power as provided in Section 21.3 of this
      Agreement or in any Confirmation Agreement.  If Firm Power is interrupted
      for any reason other than as provided in subpart (a) above, the
      non-performing party shall be obligated to pay damages under this 
 Agreement
      or Confirmation Agreement.
