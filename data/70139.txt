 
 Neil left town yesterday.  I can't really complain since he rarely travels.  
 However, he is welcome to pamper upon his return!

 I understand that you and Michael are sick with strep throat.  I hope you get 
 well over the weekend and that Neill appropriately pampers you and Michael in 
 the interim.
