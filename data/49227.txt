 Dear Giuseppe:
 
 Unfortunately, I am no longer with the Associate and Analyst recruiting 
 department and will be unable to assist you directly.  Please contact Tracy 
 Warner, who is now responsible for recruiting.  She will be able to assist 

 also recommend having Vince Kaminski contact her as well to ensure that all 
 communications are in order.
 
 Best regards,
 Celeste Roberts

 Celeste, my name is Giuseppe A. Paleologo and you amy remember me: I was
 a summer intern last summer in the research group, and attended the
 hiring event this year at Stanford. In that occasion I had an informal
 offer from Vince Kaminski, and the assurance that I would receive a
 written one in the following two weeks, but since then I have not
 received any letter from Enron. I would like to know if the offer is
 still valid, and if it has been sent. I am asking because I am in the
 process of evaluating my offers, and would like to wait for Enron before
 I make my final decision.
 
 Thanks in advance,
 
 Giuseppe Paleologo
