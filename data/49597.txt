 Hello Vince and John,
 
 I wanted to forward to you both the current presentations for campus.  We can 
 tweak these however we feel appropriate to match Cal Berkeley on Monday.  I 
 believe that we can probably expect about 30 - 50 students (based on interest 
 shown at the Career Fair).  These tend to be fairly informal.  I was thinking 
 that we could present in this order:
 
 Vince  Gives the Enron overview presentation  (30 minutes)
 John  Gives the Global Technology specific presentation (20 minutes)
  Ashley  Goes over recruiting information at the end (10 minutes)
 
 Please take a look at each presentation and speaker notes to ensure that you 
 feel comfortable with the layout and content.  I am meeting with John today 
 at 1:30 - Vince if you would like to get together and discuss as well that 
 would be great.
 
 If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me. 3-3589
 Thanks,
 Ashley
 Vince, here is a copy of the current Enron overview presentation.  There are 
 also speaker notes that go into great detail.  
 
 John, here is a copy of the current technology presentation for Carnegie 
 Mellon.  The only changes will be to the recruiting dates at the end.  There 
 are also speaker notes that go into greater detail.  --->
