 
 i guess i am going up there saturday.  i think i will try to take it easy on friday.  i can  definately tell that i am not 18 anymore b/c i cannot recover at all. i am also going broke going out.
 
  
     
 so are you heading to austin this weekend with shawn? i am ridiculous... i am already trying to make plans for the weekend. how is the roommate situation?
 
  
     
 i will invite you to be my caddie.  you can carry my clubs and clean them for me.  if you do a good job i will give you a crisp $5 bill.
 
  
     
 nothing. we did go get a pizza and then i passed out.  apparently i was more drunk then i thought. so funny story about me at the driving range yesterday...  i launched the 7 iron about 20-30 yds out onto the green. do you still think you might invite me to play a round with you some time?
 
  
     
 i will.  so what did you guys do to stay up until 7am on sunday night?
 
  
     
 Matt,
 
  i told susan that mitch and chad stayed over but didnt mention anything about her room or chad throwing up.  so remember that in your conversations with her.
