 
 it is so good to finally get one of these state of the unions again.  i don't 
 know if i can speak for everyone, but i sure have missed it.    it is just 
 good to read all the smart, witty humor again.  i especially thought the part 
 about screaming "who let the dogs out" was quite funny.  it makes it 
 especially funny b/c the employees play along instead of yelling out "shut up 
 nerd".   as most of you know chad and i no longer live together.  it was real 
 tough to see him go b/c we are pretty close, but not as close as maziarz and 
 i evidently are.  but every now and then i still get reminders that i used to 
 live with chad  like the other day when i was vacuming.  i decided to vacum 
 behind the couch b/c i had never cleand back there.  when i looked behind the 
 couch the floor was littered with about 50 toenails.    at first i was pretty 
 freaked out and i was thinking how could these toenails possibly get here?  
 but then i remembered i use to live with chad and he had a nasty habit of 
 pulling off his toenails.  i should have figured that he didn't dispose of 
 them properly.  it is good to see that chad has figured out how to use the 
 email system again.  last week enron sent out a company wide email and our 
 boy chad replied back to the whole company.  i felt pretty embarrassed for 
 him after he sent the first reply, but went he replied to the whole company a 
 second time i just thought that he was an idiot.  now he will be known as the 
 guy who replied not once but twice to a company wide email.  well, i sure am 
 looking foward to the next state of the union.  i know i will since i am 
 going to vegas to spend all my money at the strip clubs.
