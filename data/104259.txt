 Sara:  I suppose that it is Treasury that is doing all of FX transactions 
 with Enron Development and Enron Netherlands.  I do not think that these 
 activities get pushed down to any of the regions involved.  I would contact 
 Cathy Moehlman or Robin Veariel in Treasury and see who does these 
 transactions for them and gat that person involved.

 Here's your answer.  We need to put an IMMEDIATE halt to the booking of 
 EnronCredit.com Limited trades with ENA (as well as the others).  Sara
 
 P.S.  Lynn:  Is there someone we need to notify with Enron Development or 
 Enron Netherlands?

 Steve is absolutely correct -- all intercompany swap transactions between ENA 
 and Enron Corp. affiliates should be confirmed directly by RMT.

 Hopefully, none of these transactions have been "booked" for ENA by a trader 
 located in a foreign country.  That said, the general rule is that 
 intra-company transactions are generally booked directly to RMT rather than 
 to ENA and then back to RMT.  I have cc'd Rhett Jackson on my reply so that 
 he can confirm this since Rhett has become the "keeper" of the RMT technology 
 for our group.  Sorry for the delay in responding.  Steve.
 
 
     
 The following Enron companies have recently booked financial trades with 
 ENA.  I think these should be booked directly with RMT.  Please advise.
 
 Enron Netherlands Holding BV
 
 Enron Development Funding Ltd.
 
 EnronCredit.com Limited
 
 
 Thanks for your help.  Sara
