 	Are you available for a call with George and I this afternoon?  George, what works for you?

 The 8th is fine. Mel knows he never responded since I have raised that with
 him three times. George we need your help with Seth. I was in Washington
 today and they are not ready on damages although they were supposed to be. I
 am going to meet them again on Friday to drive this foward. They need
 additional information from you and maybe a pep talk. I have already tried
 to impress on them the urgency of the situation.
