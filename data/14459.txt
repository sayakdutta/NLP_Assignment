 
 
 Here are my edits to the FAQ document.  Sorry but I don't understand the pool allocation response.  
 
  
 
 My notes indicate that we also need to answer the questions
 - where storage allocation notices appear 
 - why storage allocation notices come out at a later time.
 
 Fixes already put in place
 In the follow-up letter we categorize the feedback.  Can't we go one step further and say that we have already addressed some items:
 
 - Make customers aware that they can call HotTap Helpdesk for calls
 - Raise awareness of need to minimize mrongin meetings
 - Haven't we taken a step to notify EDI customers about system downtime
 - We have taken the step of immediately notifying customers of system outages
 - Aren't we adding an injection/withdrawal indicators
 - Can't we immediately change the confusing descriptors "storage analysis completed" vs "storage allocations completed"  {See my suggestion in FAQ}
