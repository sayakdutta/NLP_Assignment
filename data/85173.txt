  Attached is revised facilities agreement reflecting a small change in the 
 design of the station.  Please review and let Cheryl Marshall know if it is 
 acceptable asap.   We will replace that page in the originals and execute and 
 forward one to Celanese.  The revised section are underlined and highlighted.
 
 Cheryl will also be faxing revised exhibits to the agreement for your review.
