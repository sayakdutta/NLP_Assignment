 I believe that Zimin was the one that asked me to bring him in.  Maybe you
 can check with him as to whether there is anyone else he wants you to
 include.
 
 Thanks!

 Shawn Grady from HR Staffing called me and asked me to schedule interviews 
 with the people in Research.  He also mentioned that I should email you to 
 find out if you want anyone from any other department to interview Rabi.  I 
 am currently scheduling interviews with you, Krishna, Grant, Stinson, Zimin 
 and Vasant.  Is their anyone else in Research that you want to interview 
 him?  Please get back to me and I will set up the appts.  Thanks.  Anita
