 
 Sorry to bring it up again, but did we finally give up on UC/CSU?  Jessie 
 Knight called me.  He's now the CEO of the Chamber of Commerce is S.D.  They 
 plan to launch a campaign next week telling businesses in S.D. that the best 
 thing to leave Sempra and switch to another provider.  ("Do you want the 
 Legislature to manage your energy costs, or do you want to manage them 
 yourself?")  
 
 They want to give illustrative examples of folks who've switched and how well 
 they're doing.  Ray McNally's sister is an extremely enthusiastic Enron 
 customer and is going to contact the Chamber.  Be useful to have a business 
 or two, or, UC/CSU.  Know it's a long shot, but figured it don't hurt to try.
