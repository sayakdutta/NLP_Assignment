 
 FINANCIAL:
 
 We have an ISDA Master in place, originally through Transammonia, Inc., 
 acting through its division Trammochem.  That master has since been expanded 
 to allow trading through additional divisions, Trammo Gas Division and Trammo 
 Gas & Petrochemicals Division.  All trades and confirms can be done as 
 follows:
 
 Transammonia, Inc.
 Transammonia, Inc. acting though its division Trammochem
 Transammonia Inc. acting through its Trammo Gas Division
 Transammonia Inc., acting through its Trammo Gas & Petrochemicals Division
 
 Obviously, Transammonia, Inc., the body corporate, needs to always be on the 
 confirm.
 
 PHYSICAL:
 
 My reports from the other Legal trading groups are that they have no 
 contracts in place, although it is somewhat unclear on the physical gas side 
 as to whether Global Contracts as to whether we have any physical gas master 
 in place.
