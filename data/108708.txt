 Most of you are aware that there are several projects on the table dealing 
 with Gas Transportation Capacity information.  On Monday, the 25th,  Russell 
 Long a Business Analyst with over 15 years of business and IT experience will 
 be joining Enron and will be assigned to help get these projects jump started 
 and provide coordination across the projects.  I'd like to get together on 
 Tuesday the 26th to present and discuss the following:
 
 High Level Combined Project Plan
 Overall Project Coordination & Documentation
 Individual Project Leads and Team Members
 Major Issues and Questions
 
 It is probably not critical that everyone be able to attend as I can follow 
 follow up later with those that can't make the meeting and I want to get 
 started ASAP.  In the mean time feel free to contact me if you have any 
 questions.  Thanks!  -  Tommy
 
 Cheryl:  Please set up the meeting referenced above and invite the people 
 address on this memo.  At a minimum I'd like to have Hunter, Colleen, Bhavna, 
 Colin, Scott, Dave, Chris Gaskill, Chris Hanz and Cade at the meeting.  I'd 
 like to meet on Tuesday the 26th if possible.  Thanks!
