 event you or John Sherriff want to set up other customer meetings while he's 
 there.  I will have him return to Houston on Friday, 9/28, but he could 
 arrive in London as early as Tuesday, 9/25.  Let me know.  Thanks, SRS

 Sherri - The date is Thursday 27th September in London.  It will be a lunch 
 format with around 20 attendees.  We will be away from Enron House at a 
 central London location (to be confirmed) between 12.15pm and 2.45pm.

 Matthew, Jeff's soundbite is "the transformation of gas and electric 
 markets."  Hope this helps.  SRS

 Sherri - Let me have Jeff's preferred September dates and I'll make sure we 
 get one of them fixed.
 
 It would be helpful if Jeff could give me a sound bite to headline his 
 discussion for the group.  One obvious area of interest is how Enron has 
 transformed itself over the last ten years to the P/E ratio of 50+ we see 
 today.  Another area of interest would be Enron's perspective of free 
 markets, regulators and California.  Please let me know Jeff's preference.

 Matthew, my apologies for the delayed response.  Jeff is definitely 
 interested in chairing the September 2001 meeting.  Please let me know if 
 you  have any dates in mind and we'll see how they work on Jeff's schedule.

 Jeff,
 
 As you may recall from our discussion on your visit to London last summer, 
 one of the challenges we have in Europe is raising the external profile of 
 Enron.  To help address this, I recently replaced Ralph in a group of UK CEOs 
 which meet monthly, so I can continue to raise awareness of Enron's 
 businesses and generally network.   At each lunch meeting which lasts around 
 two hours, one of the CEOs makes an informal 20 minute speech on a current 
 business subject of their choice and then a discussion follows.
 
 The group has asked if you would like to chair the meeting in September 2001 
 on a date of your choice.  At the end of this note there is a list of the 
 current membership.  I have been to one meeting and only around a third 
 attended.
 
 Please let me know if you are able to commit time to this.  There is no 
 problem if you decline.
 
 Matthew
