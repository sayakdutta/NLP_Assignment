 Michelle,
 
 Susan Tosoni said the revisions will not be out before Jan. 2001.  Valeria 
 said any changes will be minor.  Do you want to just proceed with this one?
 
 Thanks,
 Dave

 Dave,
 
 Is this the proposed, revised policy that OLER is working on?  The reason I 
 ask is that OLER is revising all Enron policies right now, and I think that 
 the harassment prevention policy is being revised as well.  I'd just as soon 
 we use the latest and greatest instead of the one that is soon to be 
 replaced.  Check with Valeria Hope or Susan Tosoni about the status.
 
 Thanks.
 
 Michelle

 Michelle,
 
 Here is Enron's harassment policy and the modification I made for CGAS.  Let 
 me know what you think.
 
 Thanks,
 Dave
