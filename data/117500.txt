 
 I have confirmed with Mark Holsworth that he is the right guy for this - he 
 has a form agreement that Enron uses for these situations.

 FYI - I'll talk to her about their model and plans in a little more detail.  
 In the meanwhile, given that they create a link to us either way, we might as 
 well allow them the use of our logo.  In case they become a big eye-ball 
 aggregator, we want the traffic to flow our way as well.
 
 Will check with Mark for his opinion.
 
 Thoughts?

 Rahil,
 
 Thanks for visiting Energy News Live.  We are working to correct the
 spelling of EnronOnline in the Exchange menu and you should see the change
 by the end of the week.  The reason EnronOnline is not represented as a
 logo, like Houston Street and TradeSpark, is due to legal constraints.
 Williams does not have legal permission to display Enron's logo, only the
 link.  As future phases roll out, we would like to work with your legal
 department to obtain these rights.
 
 Thanks for the feedback and please let me know if you have any further
 questions or suggestions.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Jennifer Daly
