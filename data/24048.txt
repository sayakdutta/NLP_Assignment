 
 Audrey,
 
 You should get Martin Cuilla, Jason Williams, and Jim Simpsons info by Monday.  Andy is still questioning his employment  contract.  He does like the idea of the desk moving together though.  If you do get to the long term traders, Bryant Fryhart is excellent in his area.
 
 Talk to you soon.
 
 Tom Donohoe.
