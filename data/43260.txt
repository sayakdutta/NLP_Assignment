 Hi Stan,
  
 Given all of the other issues you are, undoubtedly, handling for Enron these days, I wonder if you could do us the big favor of talking to El Paso's chairman (Weiss, spelling?).  Attached you will find an outline of a strategy for a cooperation undertaking between El Paso's power asset in the Dominican Republic (called CEPP, approximately 67 MW of barge mounted diesel engines, also selling power to the CDE, the government owned utility which has had a terrible payment record) and SECLP.  
  
 We have tried to work with El Paso's Latin America folks but there seems to be little or no interest in pushing forward an aggressive agenda; at least not with Enron.  If you could find some time just to mention these issues to him and let him know that we are very much interested in working with his team, that would be great.
  
 Thank you very much.

 Mariella, I cannot get El Paso to comment on this proposal nor give a commitment to anything more than agreeing to work together.  They don't disagree with the concept attached or the fact that we may want to be shut down at the same time to cause the GoDR to address us seriously.  I can't tell if they are not ready to commit or they just want to keep their options open for a while.
  
 I believe it would be good to give this to Stan and have him talk to his counterpart at El Paso, acknowledging that the groups are working together to achieve a common goal of realizing the stranded costs.  It might put some pressure on the indecision at the lower ranks.
