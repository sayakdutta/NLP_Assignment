 
 I've forwarded this message onto Christian Yoder, one of our lawyers. Chris 
 Mallory and Jeff Richter suggested I check with Christian first on the 
 language of these confirms. I'll get back to you first thing tomorrow.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
   
  
 Kate,
 I received and index trade into NP15 that Chris Mallory did. For Price the 
 confirmations states: 
 
 The average day ahead, post congestion price for the Constrained Price as 
 published by the California Power Exchange for the on in the period of 
 delivery stated herein plus 3.00.
 
 Is this language o.k. to accept on the confirmation.
 
 Thanks,
