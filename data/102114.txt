 
 Needs to be an officer or someone with power of attorney.  Ordinarily, you do 
 not have power of attorney unless there is board of director approval 
 authorizing you to sign contracts on behalf of the company.  
 The point is to make sure someone signs it who is authorized to bind the 
 company to the obligations of the agreement; otherwise they could argue later 
 that the agreement is not valid.

 Susan,
 Does it have to be an officer of the company (West Penetone, NiGen 
 International) that signs the agreement?
 Or is it ok for the sales rep to sign it?
 
 Thanks,
 Ken
