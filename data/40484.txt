  There have been several inquiries about the scheduling of certain
 witnesses.  To attempt to accommodate these scheduling issues, there will be
 a meeting to discuss the scheduling of cross examination on Thursday April
 5, 2001 at 1:30 pm in the Rates Hearing Room, 223, of the 911 Building.  A
 telephone bridge has been arranged for those unable to attend the meeting in
 person.  The number for the bridge is 503-230-3344.  The Passcode is 7317.
 To connect to the bridge, dial the phone number, wait for the double beep,
 then dial the Passcode.  If you have trouble connecting to the bridge,
 please call the General Counsel Receptionist at 503-230-4201.  Questions
 should be directed to Sarah Westenberg at 503-230-4753 or Peter Burger at
 503-230-4148.
