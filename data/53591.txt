 
 Lance,
 
 I could not open the attachment.
 I concur with Vasant. We always face a challenge with summer interns: we don't want
 to expose them to too much information. We typically look for a self-contained project 
 and limit intern's access to additional information.

 Hi Lance,
 
 	he looks very good.  How would you plan on using him?  My only concern about using a summer intern would be that I would not want him to learn all about Enron's operations in power trading and then go work somewhere else.  But if you think we can use him in a more generic manner where you give him specialized projects and you yourself deal directly with the traders, then that may be a possibility.  If you agree, let us check with Vince and then interview him.

 Vasant,
 
 Attached is a resume for a candidate that might serve temporarily through the summer.  Maybe this could be a stop gap measure until we can locate a full time person.  I would anticipate him working as a summer intern.

 Hi!
    Thank you very much for your help.
 Here is my resume.
 Please let me know what should I do next as soon as possible.
 Becasue I have several interview plans with other companies.
 But I would like to work at Enron most.
 So if I can get the job at Enron, I don't want to
 hang around others.
 
 Thank you again.
