 
 Hi Pete,
 
 Are the performance numbers the same as the original master numbers?  I 
 recall some email traffic on this.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay

 Kay,
 
 Is Salmon LLC the Delta Power project?  The unit 25-28 prices are $
 15,769,725 per unit.  Unit 28 Guaranteed Delivery Date (=ex-works ship date)
 is 31 December, 2001.  A unit serial number has not been assigned to date.
 
 I don't know how your business teams on LV and Delta agreements are
 distributing pricing and want to show payment and termination schedules
 between the 2 deals.  Maybe you can poll Steve Thome, Bill Williams and Jake
 Thomas to get these answers.
 
 For Salmon, the performance values in Section 10 will be per the 24 unit
 master contract.
 I'm in New Orleans today, reachable via cell phone 713-823-2055.
 
 Regards,
 
 Lee

      Attached please find a clean copy of the Salmon Energy Turbine
 Agreement (the second document below), which includes Lee Johnson's
 proposed changes to Section 10.7, as well as a blackline (first document
 below) showing changes to the (3/27) version you forwarded earlier
 today. I have include notes within the agreement indicationg those
 places where questions remain - e.g., how the addition of the new
 turbine affects the pricing schedule, guaranteed delivery, etc.
