 I've been tied up today so I haven't gotten this to you.   Maybe we can talk 
 soon.

 Kay,
 
 Please find attached for your review a Closing Documents list and a very 
 preliminary draft of the Enovate Credit Agreement.  Once you have had a 
 chance to review the attached with your business people, let's set up a call 
 to discuss structure/changes/etc.  In addition to confirming the basics 
 (lending entity, interest rate, term), we will need to discuss financial 
 covenants
 
 Please call me at 713.221.1419 regarding the foregoing.
 
 Regards,
 
 Heather
