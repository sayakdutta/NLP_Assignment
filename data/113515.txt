 I have received the list of the clients from John McMullen.  The key push is Legislative and AReM PR is not involved.  We need the customers to call the Gov and key Legislators.

 Jim,
 
 My apologies for the delayed response, however, I was on vacation when you sent the original note.  I spoke to Sue Tuesday or Wednesday of last week and she was going to send me the contacts info at AReM's  PR office so that we could put the customer's in direct contact with that individual.  As you have seen I have requested contact information from Origination and Service Management, however, I would still like to have the PR contact's info in case we have a customer only willing to speak directly to AReM's PR.  
 
 Let me know if that is something you can provide.  
 
 Regards

 It is critical that every customer in California that switched (signed new or renewal customer) during this year.  We need a contact person for each account.  The key to securing a better date is to have the customers push the Governor and the Legislature and the CPUC.
 
 We are able to provide phone numbers and contacts through our trade groups.
