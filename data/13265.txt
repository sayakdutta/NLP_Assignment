 
 Amy, we do put people under contract with a definite term; however, at the 
 end of that term, the employee converts to an employee at will.  We also hire 
 consultants for a fixed term, but a year-long period for an individual is 
 pretty long for a consultng position.  What is the situation?  Maybe we can 
 find an alternative.

 Michelle -
 
 Do we ever do fixed term offers?  I got a question today from RD Hawkins as 
 LasVegas Cogen asking if we could hire someone for a one year period of 
 time.  I know we can do it in the UK, just not sure about the US.
 
 Thanks!
 Amy
