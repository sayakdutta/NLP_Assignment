 
 I am a bit confused I thought we had agreed to the following last week.
 
 Expand to show approver and only include those things which have been approved.
 
 Issues:
 
 Why are there so many repeat lines, each request is  issuing 3 times in some cases.  Will this mean we order three by accident?
 I have no idea what has been ordered - last week I could see this time its all in code.  Please resend with descriptors.
 
 Thanks
