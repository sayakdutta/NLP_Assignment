 good morning baby
 i am not having a good morning
 i have to re-execute my contract from last week
 because we (in my rush I emailed it to legal wrong) had the price in it wrong- too many zeros
 so it looks like they can buy power for practically nil
 no one caught the error before customer signed it
 so it really sucks that I have to get him to resign
 hope it flies with him
