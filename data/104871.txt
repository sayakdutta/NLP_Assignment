 I spoke with both Matt Flett (Morgan counsel) and Denis O'Connell about the 
 ISDA already negotiated by EnronCredit.com Limited.  Each was supposed to 
 send me the draft docs for me to review and comment on for ENA.  I have not 
 received anything yet but will comment immediately upon receipt.  I'll keep 
 you up to date.  Sara
