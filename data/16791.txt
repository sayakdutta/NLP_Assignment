 
 Apologies.  I can't keep track of all the distribution lists.  Please let me 
 know if you think that this will be helpful in your neck of the woods.  Rick 
 relayed Summers comments re: Tyson. 
 
 Best,
 Jeff
 
 P.S. I'm forwarding to David Lugar

 One of the things that came out of the meeting I was at on Saturday with the 
 UC economists (including Tyson and Yellen) was a "manifesto" that they 
 published today (I'll have the final to distribute soon).  They're having a  
 press conference in about 10 minutes at Berkeley.  In anticipation, they're 
 quoted in a story in today's LA Times (that features Greenspan's comments) 
 and they focus their quotes on the need to raise rates.  Most of these folks 
 in the group, lamentably, earn their living by consulting for incumbents, but 
 there message here should be helpful, and there are a few "right-minded" 
 economists in the bunch.  (I managed to get Dr. Michaels in the group, who 
 was a great voice of reason in the debate over what to say in the manifesto.) 
  It wasn't appropriate for me to play a visible role in the design of the 
 manifesto, though I attempted to offer some behind the scenes suggestions.

 It seems this is already getting press.  Click on the following to see the 
 Los Angeles Times story.  Fortunately the LA Times did not focus on any of 
 the issues we are debating here.
