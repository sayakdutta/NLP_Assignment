 hey there.  dad told me that you got your bonus -- congratulations!  that's
 a piece of good news at least.
 
 i got some bad news about bonuses today -- we usually get them paid out
 this week, but we just got an email from our CEO saying that only a few
 "exceptional performers" will get some sort of bonus but they won't
 disclose the information until the end of January.  given that i have to
 have a new place to live for february, i don't think that I'll be able buy
 a condo anymore (the bonus money would have been for the down payment).
 anyway, kind of annoying but i guess i should be grateful that i have a
 job.
 
 mom's size is large -- she's 5'4" and about 145 pounds.  could you pass
 this on to jess?
 
 by the way, our flight comes in at around 10pm on saturday, but i'll call
 to confirm
