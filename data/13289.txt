 Thanks for the update - I've spoken to CU and they are expecting to hear from 
 you. Apart from a personal interest I would like to get an Australian version 
 of the Enron employment contract as a precedent.

 David,
 
 Hello, I hope all is well with you.  I was out last week on holiday and am 
 just now getting back into the swing of things.
 
 Alan and I have spoken about your contract, and I am getting in touch with 
 the CU lawyers to work on an appropriate form for Australia.  I will be keep 
 you apprised of the status.
 
 Have a good weekend.
 
 Michelle
