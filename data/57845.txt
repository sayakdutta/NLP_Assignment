 Steve and Brad:
 
 We need to coordinate schedules in order to interview these last 2 candidates.
 
 Stacy Durbin needs a round 2 interview and Tony Pule needs round 1 (he had a 
 death in the family and was unable to attend last week).
 
 Please let me know when during next Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday (February 
 26-28) you would be available to donate 1 hour to interview these candidates.
 
 Thank you!
