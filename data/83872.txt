 The East Desk will be hosting a baby shower for Kate and Mike Fraser, 
 celebrating their anticipated arrival of twins(a boy and a girl)!!!!!!  I 
 will be collecting $20 or whatever you would like to give for a gift.  As 
 always this is not mandatory.  You can bring your donation to my desk 
 anytime. 
 
 Thanks
