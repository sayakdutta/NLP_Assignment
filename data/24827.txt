 The Cash Balance Plan
 
 If you are vested (at least 5 years with the company) you would be eligilbe for a distribution.  If you go to the HR Web page,
 click on Benefits, A New Look For  Benefits, Pension Plan.  Then you will need to type in your ss# and pin  (which is the last four digits of your ss#)  It will lead you to a place where you could see how to calculate this figure.  You can request a distribution by calling x37979  then press Option 2 Cash  Balance Plan.
