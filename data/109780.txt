 guy doesn't have enough pressure!).  Mark, this is very generous of you.  
 Good luck with your ride and I'll see you in LaGrange!  SRS

 I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to 
 Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this 
 weekend, time is running out and we need you!
 
 Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise 
 $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you 
 consider helping him reach his goal?
 
 Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...
 
 Sherri :-)
