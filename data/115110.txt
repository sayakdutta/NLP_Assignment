 
 I checked with Sean, who said he's finished entering his deals. Mike is just 
 finishing up with his. Jeff Richter, however, still has about 8 deals to 
 enter. This should be done within the next few minutes.
 
 Please let me know if these don't come through shortly.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate

 I am missing alot of deals for Mike Swerzbinh and Sean Crandall.  Do you know 
 if they are still entering deals?
