 Thanks.
 
  
     
 Hey, Dana - 
 
 No rush at all.  You can send it interoffice if you like. (EB 3339E)
 Early next week would even be okay - I just wanted to make sure we had gotten it this month (since it apparently got lost en route to us last month).
 
 Thanks!

 Dana,
 Please make a copy of the Hanson deposit for Pat.
 
 Pat, 
 We are just depositing it today.  Sorry, I got the check during my budget blitz and forgot to tell you.    
 
 Thanks,
 Tammy
  
     
 Hey, Tammy - 
 
 Have you seen a check from Hanson this month?  If so, can I get a copy?  And if not, I'll give 'em a call.
 
 Thanks!
