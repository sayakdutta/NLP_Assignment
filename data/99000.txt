 I just accepted approx. $250,000.00 settlement from the insurance company to 
 cover part of our losses and expenses from the Styrene contamination.  I have 
 been assured by the insurance company that this settlement will not hamper 
 Enron in going after Baytank for additional funds.
 
 Once I receive the paperwork on the settlement I will forward it on to 
 Richard Sanders here at Enron.  The Insurance company has recommended a joint 
 lawsuit to try and collect the remaining lost funds.  The insurance company 
 will go after Baytank for the $250,000.00 as soon as possible.
 
 We will still have roughly $500,000.00 on the books from last year.
