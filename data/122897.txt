 As of yesterday's curves, financial mid is 5.169 and physical mid is 5.311.  The physical Index premium is at TranscoZ6 is  ~.035 in summer and ~0.5 in winter.
 
 Let me know if you need anything else.

 Charlie & Steve,
 
 I work in the power structuring group and need your assistance in pricing a gas swap.  The details are as follows:
 	Jan 1, 2002 - Dec 31, 2012
 	transco z6
 	priced at mid
 	
 I'm sure I am missing some inputs since I am new to this.  Please tell me what else I need to provide you.  Could you please give me one price with basis included and one without basis.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Steve
