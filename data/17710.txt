 ??WALNUT CREEK, Calif. _ As Democrats prepare for their first statewide
 convention since the electricity crisis erupted, some elected officials and
 strategists are warning of dire political consequences if Gov. Gray Davis 
 fails
 to clean up the power mess.
 
 ??"All of us should be thinking about the effect the energy crisis is going to
 have on our chances of maintaining control of both houses, and the effect the
 governor will have on the ticket up and down," said state Sen. Don Perata,
 D-Alameda. "If he has not performed well and he has a D after his name, that
 could be problematic."
 
 ??Garry South, the governor's top political strategist, said Thursday that the
 state's electricity woes probably won't be over soon, but the voters 
 understand
 Davis didn't create the problem.
 
 ??"It won't be solved in six months," South said. "This is an immediate 
 problem
 that is not susceptible to an immediate solution. This is a several-year 
 process
 to get this situation back under control."
 
 ??As for the governor's critics, "I think they should be asked to produce 
 their
 own plan. It's awful easy to take pot shots, but most of those who I read 
 about
 in the newspapers have no plan."
 
 ??The intraparty sniping on the eve of the party convention highlights the
 frustration Democrats are feeling about the crisis_and its potential political
 damage.
 
 ??Four months ago, this weekend's convention in Anaheim seemed certain to be a
 Davis fete. Although Democrats had lost the presidency, Al Gore easily carried
 California and the party was in firm control of the Legislature and the 
 state's
 congressional delegation.
 
 ??Davis had led the Gore effort in California and the governor was personally
 and politically popular across the state. This would have been the convention
 for him to showcase his achievements for education, the issue he had promised 
 to
 make the hallmark of his first term.
 
 ??But electricity now overshadows everything else. To be sure, the governor
 will tout his policy achievements during a Saturday morning speech to the
 convention delegates. And he is not shying away from the spotlight.
 
 ??Tonight, he will host a party for the delegates at Disney's California
 Adventure Theme Park. That prompted one Democratic consultant from Sacramento
 who won't be attending to quip, "We're in fantasy land here, thank you. We 
 don't
 need to go to Disneyland for that."
 
 ??Some are shaking their heads in disbelief at how the governor has handled 
 the
 events of the past week. "In many ways, he appears to have gone politically 
 tone
 deaf," said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, political analyst at Claremont Graduate
 University. "His instincts are not serving him well."
 
 ??While his top aides were meeting with legislators last week to warn them 
 that
 a $10 billion bond package won't be enough to get the state out of the crisis,
 Davis was at a $10,000-per-person Palm Springs golf tournament to raise money
 for his re-election campaign.
 
 ??When his hand-picked members of the Public Utilities Commission this week
 approved an electricity rate hike that experts have been predicting for 
 months,
 Davis claimed that he didn't know about the plan before it was announced and
 that he thought it was premature.
 
 ??Other Democrats, however, thought the commission action was overdue. "I'm
 glad to see the PUC stepping out and doing something along the lines that some
 of us have been talking about needing to be done for the last six or eight
 weeks," said state Sen. Tom Torlakson, D-Antioch. "There's a high level of
 frustration. There haven't been clear answers to what the solution is."
 
 ??South, the Davis political strategist, said a lot of factors are outside the
 governor's control. "No one can predict with any certainty where this is going
 to go, and no one can predict when this situation is going to be brought under
 control. We don't control the generators, we don't control the FERC (Federal
 Energy Regulatory Commission), we don't control what Wall Street is going to
 do."
 
 ??As for the potential political fallout, South said the governor and 
 Democrats
 remain in a strong position. After all, he said, the deregulation plan was
 pushed through by a Republican governor and Republicans in Washington are
 blocking efforts to cap prices.
 
 ??Jack Pitney, government professor at Claremont McKenna College, predicted
 Davis could weather the electricity crisis. "People who are following it know
 it's roots run deeper than the Davis administration and the Republicans don't
 have any plausible alternatives," he said.
 
 ??"My read of public opinion is people don't think there's a simple and easy
 solution and they're not expecting one. They may be impatient but they won't
 necessarily take it out on (Davis)."
 
 ??It's too early to predict the political outcome, said Mark Baldassare,
 pollster at the Public Policy Institute of California.
 
 ??"The impacts won't be clear until people have gone through a few billing
 cycles and we've gone through the summer blackouts, until we see what the
 personal impacts are so we know what the political impacts are," he said.
 "That's the really crucial period for Gray Davis' political future, after this
 summer."
