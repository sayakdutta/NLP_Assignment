 Please plan to attend a meeting on Friday, August 11 at 11:15 a.m. in 30C1 to 
 discuss the transportation model.  Now that we have had several traders 
 managing transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss 
 any issues you have with the way the model works.   I have asked Zimin Lu 
 (Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they 
 will be available to answer any technical questions.   The point of this 
 meeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is 
 comfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those 
 who are managing the books believe in the model's results.   Since I have 
 heard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to 
 discuss them.
 
 Please let me know if you are unable to attend.
