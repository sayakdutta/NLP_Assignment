 
 Mary, I would say a couple of things.  I describe Enron's unique culture 
 using adjectives like , empowerment, innovation, innovation on steroids, high 
 energy, exciting, challenging, cool, a great place to work.  Each one of 
 these can be made into a sentence and/or a statement.  
 
 I hope this is what you were looking for.
 Mike

 I'm compiling the information for this year's Fortune survey.  One of the 
 questions included in the Culture Audit is "What makes your company unique?"  
 
 If you were asked this question, how would you respond?  Please send me your 
 answer by Thursday, July 20.   
 
 Thanks.
 
 Mary
