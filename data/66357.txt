 A blind guy on a bar stool shouts to the bartender, "Hey! Wanna hear a
 blonde joke?" The bar immediately becomes absolutely quiet. In a hushed voice,
 the guy next to him says, "Before you tell that joke, you should know
 something."
 "The bartender is blond, the bouncer is blond, and I'm a 6' tall, 200 pound
 blond with a black belt in karate.  What's more, the guy sitting next to me
 is 6'2," weighs 225 pounds, and he's a blond weight lifter." He continues,
 "The fella to your right is blond, 6'5" and pushing 300 pounds, and he's a
 wrestler. Think about it seriously, Mister. You still wanna tell that
 joke?"  The blind guy says, "Nah! Not if I'm gonna have to explain it five
 times.
