 
 My meeting with Rod is next Wed.
 
  
     
 Shelley, have you scheduled the meeting with Rod to discuss some measurement issues?  Raetta & Jodie are asking and I suppose they are preparing materials for you.  They must need a timeframe.  Let me know and I will put this on your calendar and advise them.
 
 Thank you, Ricki
