 I left a message for Michael. He is on vacation.

 Dear Vince,
 
 I am so grateful for your efforts.  I really appreciate you taking time from 
 your busy schedule.  If you have not contacted Michael Maddox, it's even 
 better.  I have updated and re-worded my resume to better reflect my 
 accomplishments.  Would you please contact Michael Maddox of CERA and forward 
 my resume to him?  His contact information is (617) 497 6446 or email: 

 
 Have you had a chance to talk to David Port?  Maybe there are other options.  
 I am flexible and willing to do whatever it takes.
 
 
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Bessik Matchavariani
