 Are you cleaning fishing boats, too?
 
 
 
 
  
     
 Hey there cheese dick. How's life in H-Town? This is my new work e-mail. I'm
 doing accounting work at this boat manufacturer. If you're in the market for
 a nice fishing boat you let me know. Capron filled me in on your quest for a
 Vegas trip. Doesn't look good. Due to my recent bout of unemployment, I
 don't think gambling would be a good use of my available fundage. Tara and I
 will be in Houston Nov. 15th thru 18th for Curry's wedding. Plan on throwing
 back a few that weekend when we get some spare time. Are you and Beth
 together or apart at this time? I really could just flip a coin and get as
 accurate an answer as you would give me, huh? Take it easy hombre. Go Cards!
