 Summer Schedule
 I'm not planning any camps for Chad the week of June 3 because of Swim Team (really busy first week of June).  
 
 June 10-14 is Grace VBS
 
 We'll be on vacation week of July 1-7
 
 Ashford VBS July 22-26
 
 Hopefully Nature Explorer Camp week July 29 - Aug 2.
 
 
 I'd like to sign him up Biron's or some other camp 1 or more weeks (either):
 June 24-28
 July 8-12
 July 15-19
