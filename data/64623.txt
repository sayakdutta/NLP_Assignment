 
 how is everything going?  did you have fun in denver?  how about the 
 cornhuskers.  they seem to be getting by barely.  it should be interesting as 
 they play better teams.  have you been golfing?  i haven't golfed in a long 
 time, but  i am going saturday.  i am also going to california next week and 
 will golf there.  give me a call this weekend if you get a chance.
