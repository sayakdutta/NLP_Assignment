 Listed below are some specific answers to your questions.  In addition, please check the www.enron.com <http://www.enron.com> web site regularly for up-to-date Q & A.  You may also call me if you need further clarification.
  
 1.  You will be receiving a termination letter and other information regarding your termination this week.
 2.  You will receive pay for Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday last week. This amount is included on a check that is being mailed to your home this week.
 3.  Your termination letter will be the document that you can provide to your wife's employer to enroll in her benefit plan.  This same letter will facilitate an unemployment claim as well as providing documentation for a judge where you are to serve on jury duty
 4.  Submitted and approved expenses are being processed.  Because there is a high-volume of requests, this is taking some time, and we are working as quickly as possible.
 5.  Please send me a copy of your unpaid phone bill and I will forward it to accounts payable for processing.
  
 Please feel free to contact me if you need further assistance or clarification.
  
 Take Care
