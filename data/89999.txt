 
 Let's bring him in for an interview.
 
  
     
 Kevin this is the forecaster with an attitude.
 
 Sounds like he has a fair amount of drive and would fit in well at Enron.
 
 I have been emailing Craig once a week until I heard from Gerald who I have a lot of faith in as far as reference as I did not want to inherit a problem PHD.  I have asked research (Vasant) to check him out as well.
 
 I believe that this cat might be what I need to get the forecast Rogers and Services need for our wholesale to retail delivery amounts with limited or no metering.  I would have him work on a project that uses the metering we receive to forecast Rogers wholesale delivery requirements hourly.
 
 I will proceed to bring him in unless I hear otherwise from you.

 I am on Craig's committee and worked with him for two years (1999-2000)
 through his major professor, Eric Bartlett.  I think that Craig is a
 self-starting person, familiar with neural networks and statistics.  He has
 done a good job with programming on the internet and is very interested in
 forecasting.
 
 I think that with the right opportunities, he will do very well.

 Gerald can you provide me with the link you are referring to.
 
 Also I have been in contact with a Craig Carmichael.  Can you provide me
 with any insight in his forecasting abilities and potential.

    I have been out of the country and out of town for some time.
 
    I was to visit with Vince Kaminski, but this was delayed and then not
    rescheduled.
 
    I would like to discuss the web page portal that ENRON has with regard
    to
    retail customers.  We are studying such portals for service marketing.
    Another student and I are designing a set of web pages for a given
    product
    set as a class project.  Could you provide a contact for a short
    conference
    call?
 
    Thank you,
 
    Gerry
