 Carol:
 How would the following work for you --  1-1:30 pm your time tomorrow
 afternoon or either 8:30 - 9:00 am or  1-1:30 your time on Thursday?  Mike
 Roach and I are in different cities, so if you and Ed Sacks are able to be
 at the same number, it may be easiest for me to initiate the call.
 
 Regards,
 Keith Ferguson
