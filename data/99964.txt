 No matter how hard I try to get BVZ to include float in the schedule, to
 allow for the "unknown things" which are bound to occur, they insist on the
 most optimistic outcome and it never happens.
 
 On Friday we will do the tests as detailed below.  After that there are
 other tests which will take place before the plant goes commercial.

 What seems to be the problem with start up.  When you do will you be in
 more test phases or commercial.

                  Saturday Sept 15, HE 7:00
 
    This schedule is for performance testing as follows:
 
    1) Cold Start Test
         Must bring the plant up to Base Load in less than 8 hours.
         Scheduled to start both CT's during HE 8:00
 
    2) Steam Turbine Trip Test:
         Scheduled to occur in HE 17:00 then bring CT back up to base.
 
    3) Operation at Minimum Load:
         Scheduled to occur  HE 21:00 to HE 22:00
 
    Special Request to DETM and WAPA for today to permit Griffith to change
    plant output without constraint as long as we strive to make the average
    MW
    shown on this schedule for each hour.  (This has been approved by Cal
    Ingram of WAPA)
 
    Note: If something happens and BVZ cannot stay on this schedule, then
    DETM
    can again call for limits on the timing of ramp up or down as required.
