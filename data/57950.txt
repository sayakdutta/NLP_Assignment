 rearrange his calendar to make it work.  I will let you know his itinerary as 
 soon as I have finalized it.

 Steve, 
 
 If you are available, the new UK Energy Minister Peter hain has asked to meet 
 with Enron at 3pm on 6 February here in our DC offices.  If you or another 
 senior Enron official cannot make it or do not want to make it, please let me 
 know ASAP as I will scratch the date from his diary.  Schroeder thought it 
 would be useful for you to do it.
