 
 Team,
 
 I still need comments on the GE break out contract which was previously 
 forwarded to Finance, Accounting and Tax. If anyone who didn't get it would 
 like to get it, please let me know.  
 
 Also, I am unclear as to whether the consent form we received earlier this 
 week is the final version from Enron's standpoint.  Any information on that 
 point would be appreciated.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
