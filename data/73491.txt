 
 I've got the crib, a playpen, red and blue check bumpers for the crib, a 
 never used airplane baby swing you hang on a trees (our trees were too tall), 
 perhaps a jogging stroller (don't think we gave it away), and I don't know 
 what else.  All have "baby Carnahan" on it.  Will she give the baby her last 
 name?  That would be cool.
 
 I met someone (a guy)  named Kayne.  Yes, I know it looks like Kay, but I 
 thought it sounded cool.  Kayne Carnahan.  Opps, sounds like a bull rider!

 Remember not to throw away baby stuff!  My oldest daughter, Sara has already 
 bought a complete wardrobe for the baby including girl and boy outfits.  I 
 guess I had better get on the ball and at least buy a "I Love Granny" bib or 
 something!  Ha.
 
 Do you know Carlos' cell phone number?  His normal secretary is out.
