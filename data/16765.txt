 
 Hi Cindy:
 
 Mark asked me to give you these to fax to Mark at the Four Seasons.  Three 
 things:
 
 Berkeley Academics "Manifesto"--very confidential
 My preliminary doodlings for a talk I'm giving at an EXNET conference in New 
 York on Monday
 A one page "backgrounder" that Jim and I put together for the Bush transition 
 team.
 
 Thanks a million.
 
 Jeff
