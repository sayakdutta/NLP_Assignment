 
 I have a copy of the signed Employee Services Agreement between Bridgeline 
 and ENA.  Would you like a copy of it?  Michelle

 David,
 
 I believe the agreement was signed.  It would have been a Corporate Services 
 Agreement.  I believe that Shonnie Daniel or Steve Van Hooser worked on 
 this.  I have cc'd this email to them so that they can provide you with a 
 copy, forward it on to the appropriate person, or let me know if one never 
 was signed, in which case I can prepare a new version.
 
 Thanks.  Michelle

 I was given your name by Steve Venturatos.  He said that you were involved in 
 getting a Master Agreement set up so that Enron would supply a Risk team to 
 take care of that function for Bridgeline.  I talked with Trevor Mihalik and 
 he believes that an agreement was never signed.  Can you help me determine if 
 there is an agreement in place and if not can we get one created?
