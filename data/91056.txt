 What I was remembering was the front months exposures we had at EDF MAN.
 	Prior to moves                After
 DEC	-2,003			 1,967
 JAN	10,502			-1,588
 FEB	 1,338			   552
 MAR	-7,013			   188
 APR	 5,831			     33
 
 the over all position before the move was 1,240 and as of yesterday it is 4,205.
 
 Let me know what the concerns are at EDF MAN and the request that they are making.
 We can shift some positions around if the have levels by months that they want us to stay under.
