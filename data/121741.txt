 
 Hi Kirk,
 
 I just wanted to check on you and see how the approval process was going.  Have you heard from the ACC Commissioners yet?  Please let me know if we can do anything for you.
 
 Thanks, Kim.
 
 
     Agreement - Revised 
 
 
 Hi Kim.
 Just wanted to let you know that the Big Sandy project is awaiting a vote
 yes/no from the ACC Commissioners on the 26th of this month.
 At this point, I think it is likely that the project will not be approved,
 and may opt to resubmit.
 Counsel for Caithness in the appeal process suggested a negative bias in the
 ACC Power Plant Siting Committee, and that was not well received by the
 Commissioners....major blunder.
 I will keep you updated as this continues to develop.
 If a yes vote, then we will proceed immediately with interconnect agreement,
 etc.
 Best regards,
 Kirk
