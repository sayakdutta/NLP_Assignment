 (requiring President level approval for all Demarc delivery deals)? Can Danny 
 revoke the policy, just like Bill created it?  DF

 As long as Dave and/or you are signing off on the EOL packages, I don't have 
 any problem with this.  As to non-EOL deals, we may also want to eliminate 
 the requirement that all Demarc deals need such a high approval level.  I 
 don't think there is anything uniquely risky about Demarc as long as we have 
 our capacity posting squared away.  DF

 Drew,
         Placement of a demarc delivery package on EOL necessarily means it 
 was approved.  An after the fact note from Linda will suffice.

 Tenaska Marketing Ventures accepted a package on EOL yesterday that delivers 
 to demarc.  Although EOL deals are pre-approved the CMS system is coded to 
 route demarc deals to the president level.  In order to expedite the 
 activation of this request and since it was a pre-approved EOL deal, I 
 approved the route for each of you in CMS per a request from marketing.  
 
 Please let me know if this process will not be agreeable on future EOL deals 
 that include demarc.
 
 Thanks
 
 Linda
