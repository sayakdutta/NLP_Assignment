 Kevin -
 
 Unfortunately I have a family wedding that weekend and my parent's are coming in town.  Thanks for the thought - if there was any way I could get out of my situation I would.

 A group of 14 people (West and East Power) will be taking an off-site to Cabo June 22-24.   We would like for you guys to join the group for a wild weekend in Mexico.   That's the good news.  Due to space limitations, we need you guys to fly commercial from Houston to Cabo (on company $'s, of course).   On the way back, you would fly on the company plane, and Zufferli would fly commercial directly to Calgary.
 
 We plan on departing Houston on Friday 6/22 at 3:00 pm and return Sunday at approx. 6:00 pm.
 
 Are you guys in?   We will have a blast.
