 Teb, I was finally able to get the imbalance quantities data from TSS--my reports were contending with other jobs.  Anyway, attached is the latest rendition of the Gas Daily prices, the Natural Gas Week Cash Out price, and the monthly imbalance quantities.  Any questions please call.  
 
 Thx, Jim
