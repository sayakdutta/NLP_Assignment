 
 Canada officializes one calc that includes both their price and basis 
 positions.  Risktrac only recognizes the book id to which it assigns the post 
 id.  Since the Canada post id includes two books ids,  we manually assign the 
 same post id to the basis book so that both books are picked up.

 Robin,
 I have to get this email out and I'm looking for your help. Can you proof 
 read what I wrote and "correct" things that are wrong...
 
 Thanks,

 Debbie,
 
 
 I spoke with Robin and she confirmed that:
 One post id for both price and basis books
 She overrides the price book
 
 The reason is that Risktrac needs unique book id/post id combo's.  However, 
 the price book comes in no matter what, so she overrides the price book in 
 order to pull in the basis book...She added that she also did not understand 
 why they use one post id..
