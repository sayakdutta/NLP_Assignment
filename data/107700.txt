 
 Absolutely OK to send me a resume on any good person.  Also thanks for the 
 update on the new car.  My dilemma is that I need a bigger car to carry 
 anything, as you know the porsche isn't the most conducive car for such 
 activity.  I'll probably be in before early 2002, as such.  
 Best regards,
 
 Jeff
 
 
 
 

    
 
 Jeff,
 I trust all is well with you at the office. 
 
 New Range Rover - I want to relay that I am privately informed Ford wish to 
 accelerate
 the U.S launch of the new car. The UK launch is Sept. this year so reasonably 
 may mean arrival here early 2002. Believing this to be accurate, this may 
 relieve you of making any decision on Range Rover right now.
 
 Given your continuous search for "good people" and assuming your firm remains 
 on the look-out for such people, I wish your permission to submit a resume of 
 a colleague.
 This lady has excellent work-ethics, is an outstanding achiever with high 
 energy and I believe, the suited attributes for the culture within Enron. 
 I would hope this could be reviewed and sent onward to the relevant people 
 who would invite her for an initial meeting in the near future. Please advise 
 this is okay.
 Alan
