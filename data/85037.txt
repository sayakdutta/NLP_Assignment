 Scott Sitter in Denver probably needs a copy of these docs.  Might want to 
 check with him and see if anyone else in Denver needs a copy.

 Regarding documents that I have had recorded in Campbell County, Wyoming, we 
 are now ready to send the originals to the file room.  Are there any other 
 originals that need to go with them?  Are there any other persons who may 
 need a copy of the recorded document(s)?
 
 Kim Bennick takes care of the distribution of our recorded originals after I 
 have finished having them recorded.  Please let Kim know if these Wyoming 
 documents should be treated differently than our normal Houston Pipe Line 
 recordings.
 
 Thanks!
 -Becky
