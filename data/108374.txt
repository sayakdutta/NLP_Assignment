 Regarding MTBE we all are aware it will likely phase out over the next 2/3 
 years BUT we are a producer of 15,000 bpd from our company owned gulf coast 
 plant. We also have several years left on our MTBE marketing agreement with 
 Dubai Natural Gas Company. As a producer we are in an Ideal position to make 
 markets in gulf coast MTBE. While the production facility was not a good 
 business for Enron (and has been mostly written off) MTBE Trading has been 
 and continues to be a good business. I would assume that the plant is also 
 now making profits with the capital expense written off.
