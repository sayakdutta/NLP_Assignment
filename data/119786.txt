 
 Good luck in your new position!  I'm glad things worked out for you.
 
  
     
 Hello.  I just wanted to tell some of my favorite people (to work with) that after today, Thursday, November 15th, I will no longer be part of the Regulatory Affairs Team.  I'm moving on to a different part of Enron, EES.  In fact, I officially start November 16th.
 
  I really enjoyed working with/and for you guys.  I've learned quite a bit from you all and I wanted to say Thanks.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Melinda
