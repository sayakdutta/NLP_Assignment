 
 You may or may not be able to do anything about this but I've requested access to several different desk in Sitara and the people that approve these items all work for UBS.  Now I'm trying to pull up a deal that was on the central desk ( I thought) and its showing up as a west desk ticket and I can't access it.  I thought I was the one that entered it in Sitara.  Sitara deal #1198936 is an example.
 
 Can you help get me access?
 
  
     
 I did submit a request via "e Request" - #83213.  I didn't know if you wanted to assign other people to do this and I don't know HOW you would do that either.  I just asked for everything to cover all the bases.
 
  
     
 You don't need UBS approval for access to estate files.
 
 Did you submit a request for access.  I will approve.
 
 You can not have access to AEP info however.
 
 thanks

 I hope I have the right Bob Hall.  I'm trying to get sitara access to the West and Texas Desk and they have not been approved yet.  I'm waiting for Phillip Love (now with UBS) to approve the West and O'Neal Winfree (not sure who this is) to approve the Texas Desk.
 
 Tommy Yanowski was able to help with a couple of these but it looks like we need to get the approving parties changed.
 
 I also left a message for the help desk about this.
 
  
     
 	You were not given access to AEP.
