 FERC is just a month and probably will be expediated to less than that.  I want all the transmission and pool agreements to start much earlier - what is the problem with starting the negotiation now.
 
 We really cannot accept these timescales - we have always assumed one month and all of this stuff is in place.
 
 I'll be on the phone call  - let me know times/numbers	
 
 Tammie - get Liz Sager to attend
 
 
 
 
 
 
     
 
 One final new year's email: the netco startup plan for power is assuming 45-60 days to get a FERC license, 60-120 days to get transmission and pool agreements, etc so transaction volumes will be trivial for the first few months unless we look at some new approaches such as buying a small marketer.  Presto, belden, sager, nicholai and I are meeting 9:30 wednesday to discuss.  Hillis set up a room if you would like to attend.
