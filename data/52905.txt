 Thanks. FYI. Our internal RAC models assign roughly BB credit rating to Enron.

 Hi Kelly,
 
 here is an updated version of the KMV writeup with some general positives as well.  I eliminated the last section on Enron, and changed some wording.  I did not think you wanted to explictly give Enron's EDF on the website.  Let me know if you want to add it back, and if you have any other suggestions.  I will continue to review how else we can change/extend the writeup.
 
 Thanks,
 Vasant
