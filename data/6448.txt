 I was thinking we would have an "organized dinner" on Friday and catch 
 something on the way back from the game on Saturday (since it is late).
 Let me know

 I will make reservations for dinner today. I sent Dad the info on
 restaurants yesterday but I forgot to ask him which one to reserve.  There
 is one near the hotel -Brio Vista - and two downtown - Jeffrey's and Louis
 106.  I'll talk to him and get back with you.  Dinner Friday night, correct.
 Are we on our own Saturday?  LU-M
