 Per my voice mail, in addition to other changes we are discussing, I would
 like to modify PG&E Affiliate and Enron Afiliate to mean affiliates who are
 party to an Underlying Master Agreement, and expressly recognize that PG&E
 Gas Transmission, Northwest Corporation is not a PG&E Affiliate.  These
 additions are shown blacklined in the first attachment to this e-mail. Also,
 add to signature block of the Netting Agreement and to the coverage of the
 Guarantee our affiliate CEG Energy Options Inc.   Thanks, Peter

 Attached is the revised netting agreement based upon certain PGE comments.
