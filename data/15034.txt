 Thanks Bruce, I appreciate it.
 
  
     
 I forward this on to McCabe.  Joe Toussaint will be talking to him.  I will
 get you an answer this week.
 
 
     
 
 Hey Bruce,
 
 Thanks for the response.  I think I would like to see Cinergy's bid.  I
 sort of have to weigh many nonfinancial issues as well.  It would be nice
 to know where we are at.  If you could provide me a rough number, that
 would be helpful.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Sean

    We have not reached an answer on the head trader.  McCabe is on vacation
    this week.  I would say we are not prepared to match any of your offers.
    I'm not sure it makes sense to show you an offer that is lower than your
    other deal.  If you still interested let me know.  Thanks for coming to
    see
    us.  We sure would love to have you on the team.
 
    
                 
 
    Hey Bruce,
 
       Hope you had a good vacation.  I was just touching base to see where
       we're at.  I leave for Europe on June 5 and I'll be gone until July
    2.
       My last day in the office here will be either Thursday or Friday of
    this
       week.  Some other places you can contact me are:
 
       cell:  503-805-2557
       home:  503-656-5253

 
       Thanks,
 
       Sean
