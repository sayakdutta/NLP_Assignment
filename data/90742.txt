 Good news bad news.   The course here in town would only take one tee time
 without a credit card.  It is at 10:57  Yuk.  The really nice course that is
 just as close to my house didn't have a time until 12:02  YUKKKK.  So I
 called Anahuac and they had a 9:32 and a 9:40.  So I booked the 10:57 and the
 two at 930.  The anahuac course is nice but it is another 15-20 min. from my
 house.  If we need only one tee time we can go from my house in my car.  If
 we have two then I'll drive and someone else will have to as well.  Let me
 know how many people and so forth.   (Evergreen is about 40 dollars and
 Anahuac is about 25.)
