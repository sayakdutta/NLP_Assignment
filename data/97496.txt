 Richard:  Following up on my voicemail message to you.  As I mentioned, we 
 were referred to you by Mark Haedicke in connection with some inquires I have 
 regarding the application of the attorney-client or work-product privileges 
 to internal operational audits.  In particular, I am interested in Enron's 
 standard practice in that regard and any standard or sample documentation 
 used to cover the audit reports by one or both of the privileges.  Im also 
 curious as to whether the same approach has been used with respect financial 
 audits regarding internal controls.  Pls let me know.
 
 Regards,
 
 Bill Krenz
