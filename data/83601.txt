 (If you're not planning on going camping this weekend, please disregard
 this memo.)
 
 The basketball Gods have issued a technical foul to the Indian Guides by
 scheduling a late Friday night game for all the boys that had RSVP'd to go
 camping Friday night, so, here's Plan-B:
 
 The official start-up time is now Saturday afternoon.  Let's plan on a
 caravan to the campsite from Butch Butcher's house.  Let's meet there
 around 2:00 pm.  If you can't leave at that time (earlier or later),
 information on the campsites are available at the park entrance under
 "Wilchester Indian Guides/Butcher".  Depending on the outcome of the game
 Friday night, an earlier caravan may be going Saturday morning.  Stay close
 to your phones.
 
 As mentioned in earlier memo,  we will provide food for Saturday night (
 hamburgers and fixin's for the boys).  If  Dads want something other than a
 burger, please feel free to bring a steak to throw on the grill.  We will
 also provide food for Sunday breakfast.  Please feel free to bring whatever
 snacks or drinks you want as well.  Remember to bring bikes, fishing stuff
 (optional), sporting goods, bug spray, camping stuff (I'm bringing an extra
 tent), cards, lottery tickets, ...  If you need help getting your bike to
 the park, call Butch (professional mover).
 
 Oh yeah, Directions (if you miss the caravan):
 
 From US-59, take Grand Parkway (TX-99)/Crabb River Rd exit and proceed
 South on Crabb River Rd.  Continue over RR tracks on TX-762 for about 15
 miles and take left into Brazos Bend State Park entrance.
 
 From Clear Lake area (who's coming from Clear Lake ?) take either FM-517 or
 FM-528 to TX-35.  Proceed to FM 1462 west.  Take a right on TX-762 and the
 Park entrance is about 1 mile on the right.
 
 Yah-teh-hay!
