 Lisa Bills and Roseann Engeldorf and Kay Mann need to be involved.  Thursday 
 afternoon or Friday is good for me.

 Roger/Herman,
 
 I've recently joined Ben Jacoby's Project Development team and have been 
 asked to look into how we can remove the four LM 6000 turbines from the West 
 LB structure for transfer to the Austin project.  As I realize that this 
 transfer must be managed carefully in order to avoid placing these turbines 
 and the remaining assets in the West LB structure on our balance sheet, I was 
 wondering if you could offer some guidance regarding this issue.  
 Specifically, if we could set up a meeting for Thursday or Friday of this 
 week to discuss how this might be accomplished, I'd appreciate it.  
 
 Thanks.
