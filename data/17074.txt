 now an absolute lost cause, or it's more urgent than ever to have Ken Lay 
 talk to him.  Given the situation, it would still seem prudent to have Ken 
 Lay talk to the Speaker.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 The following message points are being circulated by Assembly Speaker Robert 
 Hertzberg.  These are very confidential and should not be distributed. 
   
 Deregulation has been a failure of epic proportions, and Californians are 
 hurting because of it. 
   
 This is bigger than politics. People have energy bills they cannot afford. 
 Rolling blackouts threaten our economy - as well as the safety of our people. 
 We cannot allow this to continue. 
   
 This is not a bailout, it's a lifeboat for consumers. We support the 
 Governor's plan as a framework for negotiations with the utilities. 
   
 The state purchase of transmission lines -- at the right price and under the 
 right terms - will restore a measure of control to a system that is out of 
 control. 
   
 Our goal continues to be restoring reliable, reasonably priced power to all 
 of California.
