 
 I would like to invite each of you to participate in a brainstorming session 
 with me on Friday, January 12 from 8:30 am through lunch.  The purpose of 
 this meeting will be to surface and capture ideas around the potential 
 commercialization of mid and back office services that we provide.  I know 
 that many of you have ideas about services and/or products that could be 
 marketed and some of you have been involved in arrangements where we have or 
 are currently providing services to outside parties.  While there are efforts 
 underway with certain modules under CommodityLogic, I want this session to be 
 used to take a broader look at how we might market mid and back office 
 services.  I hope that you will be able to attend.  
 
 Details on location of the meeting and more exact timing will be sent to you 
 on Monday when Patti returns from vacation.
