 Because a large number of our invitees had conflicting schedules, we are moving the date of our Appreciation Luncheon for the LAST TIME!!! 
 
 This will be our last attempt to accommodate everyone.  Trust me, the food and games at Jillians will be well worth your patience.
 
 Steve's main objective was to include as many of  ETS' TW Teams as possible.  We feel that Friday,  the 5th of October would better suit the majority of our teams.  
 
 We thank you for your patience and please respond by September 26.
