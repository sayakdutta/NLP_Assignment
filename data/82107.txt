 Errol,
 
 There are two trades that were done with Mirant Americas through 
 Intercontinental Exchange.  TAGG does not reflect these trades.  I faxed the 
 broker statements to Sherry D. and she stated that she forwarded them to 
 you.  Trade dates were on Nov. 13th and Nov. 14.  I also asked Joe Hunter to 
 check into this and he stated that he had spoken to you some time last week 
 or the week before and stated that you would be getting back with me on the 
 TAGG deal numbers.
  
 When I querried TAGG this morning selecting Intercontinental Exchange as the 
 broker, no deals were found.
 
 Can you please let me know the deal numbers as these trades need to be 
 settled as soon as possible.
 
 Thanks,
 Mechelle
