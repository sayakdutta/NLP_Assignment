 
 Frank,
 
 I'm sorry,  but disregard the first message I sent.  The $234MM value I 
 alluded to is not the value for the one deal booked with a 1993 deal date.  
 This value represents the MTM value for all active deals w/ Sithe.  I'm still 
 working to find a deal like your requested.  I'll let you know.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Errol
