 I recently requested historical flow information from Questar pipeline.  In=
  their response they indicated that they will only provide flows for the on=
 e or two locations for which Enron has capacity allocations.  Chris Gaskill=
  indicated that you would be able to comment on whether this is consistent =
 with the FERC 637 reporting requirements.  We wish to aquire historical flo=
 ws for all metered points currently reported daily on Questars website (onl=
 y 30 days history is available on their system) from June 1, 2000 to March =
 1, 2001.  I have attached my original request and Questar's response.  Feel=
  free to call with questions (3-0472).  Thank you in advance.

 Gerry,
 
 Per our conversation, I am requesting historical scheduled (final cycle) qu=
 antities for Questar Pipeline meter points.  Questar previously provided fl=
 ows up to June of 2000.  We are now requesting from June 1, 2000 to March 1=
 , 2001.  I would prefer the information be emailed to me.  Otherwise the po=
 stal address is:  Rm#3299E, 1400 Smith St., Houston, TX 77002.  Please feel=
  free to contact me with any questions at 713-853-0472.  Thank you.

 Matt,
    It looks like Enron has only one active contract on QPC.  That is a rele=
 ase capacity contract from Chalk Creek to the Wasatch Front.  I can provide=
  daily data on that point for the period during which the contract is effec=
 tive if you would like.
 
 Because we do not offer the other data you  have requested to all shippers =
 on the pipeline, I can not respond fully to your request for historical dat=
 a on all or most points on the pipeline.
 
 Once again I would suggest that you refer to our website (www.questarpipeli=
 ne.com) to begin gathering the information you need from this point forward=
 .  I would be happy to answer any questions  you may have regarding data po=
 sted on the web site
