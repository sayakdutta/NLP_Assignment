We need to start pulling together explicitly why we lost so much in one day, what the var limits were that day and what has been the experience since then. Tx Rick
 
  
     
 Rick,
 I have no problem making the trip.  I will leave it to you to consider the resources necessary to give the pitch.  I don't think there is much else that as important.  I have just finished reading the book 'When Genius Failed' about LTCM and, at the end of the day, funding positions through turmoil is almost more important than being right in the first place.  FYI, I will be in Houston on 6/21 for the prc. Originally planned to leave on 6/22.  Could stay through weekend and fly back to London thru NY.
 Let me know
 Ted
 
 
  
     
 I hate to ask you to make yet another trip. However, there is probably nothing more important right now given markets view of us as a trading company. ?Let me check w/ Despain on pulse here. Get back to you. Rick
