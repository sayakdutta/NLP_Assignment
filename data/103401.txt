 
 Bob:  I left you a voice mail last week about a lunch that legal would like 
 to present next month for both groups (above).  We need a list of settlements 
 persons who should be invited.  The purpose of the meeting is to provide an 
 overview of the legal documentation process, including explanations of our 
 documents, and encourage dialogue among the groups.  Please send as soon as 
 possible.  Also, let me know if you have any particular topics which you 
 would like to see addressed.  Thanks.  Sara
