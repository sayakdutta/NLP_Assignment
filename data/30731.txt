 Thanks
 
 
 
 
 
 

   
  
 
 Blue, white, and orange are the colors.  I think blue or orange would be  
 good. Cliff and Lee will commit to one apiece.    Also you may want to call  
 all the parents about the practice shirts and remind them of the changed  
 practice time this Saturday which starts at 9am. Thanks Tracy!   CLR
