 Client received an FMLA leave request based on a Certified Nutritionist's
 completion of the serious health condition form.  This does not appear to be
 a person authorized by the regs to certify a person as having a serious
 health condition.  Any thoughts on how to respond to this leave request.
 Billable credit for the most helpful response(s).
