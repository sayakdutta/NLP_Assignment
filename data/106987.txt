 (1)  the BS&Co. confirm references the "Irrevocable Sell Order dated August 9, 2001".  Please forward a copy.  This apparently contains definitions for (multiple) Sell Order Execution Dates.
 
 (2)  according to your notes, the BSIL "Standard Terms and Conditions of Business" is subject to review by a UK lawyer.  Please advise of your conclusions. Forward executed version (which is incorporated into the confirms).
 
 (3)  the BS&Co. confirm references the Customer Agreement and incorporates this as a Credit Support Document.   Please forward executed verison.  [BS&Co. also claims that deals pursuant to your Customer Agreement are Specified Transactions for purposes of OTC derivative transactions]
 
 (4)  portions of the confirm do not match the unexecuted Term Sheet which you gave me.  Was a Term Sheet executed?  Is there an ENE guaranty which is supposed to be a Credit Support Document under the confirm?
