 After speaking with Iain Russell today and him coming to the Weather Group
 noticing the fax machine , he mentioned that it is outdated and costing
 a lot of money.
 He made a phone call to get the old fax machine removed therefore we 
 will receive new models soon.
 We would save half the rental cost on these new machines.
 
 FYI.
 
                                                           Thanks
                                                        Kevin Moore
