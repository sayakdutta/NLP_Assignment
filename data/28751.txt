 giving them the option on the Eldo-Spraberry line.  I haven't really thought 
 about it, but I guess the transfer price for the Hobbs line should be some 
 nominal amount--$10 or something.  I'll give you and Louie a call in a bit to 
 discuss.  Thanks.  DF
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
   
  
 Drew, thanks for the fax.  Quick question... is the purchase price a flat 
 3,000,000 without any adjustments for line pack... Since we are going to sign 
 and close same day, we won't need adjustments for cap ex.  I am putting 
 together a draft PSA now.  THanks.  Kim
