 Steve,
 
 Fyi!  I left Ken a message on the e-mail below and he said he wanted to get with you.  If you can reply by email to the people below, we will handle from there.
 
 I will be out of the office on 9/17, 9/18 and 9/19.
 
 Thanks!!
 
 Mary

 Jenny, I'm not sure you're the appropriate person with whom to address this; please let me know...
 
 Jeff Skilling and I will no longer be Enron employees effective 9/15/01.  We have sent out letter to several hundred business associates and friends of Jeff's letting them know how to reach him; however, I suspect we missed more than a few.  I'd like to keep our phone numbers (JKS x36894 and me X35984) through the end of the year for voicemail purposes only.  I will put a greeting on which give new contact information.  In addition, I'd like to have a "bounce back" message on e-mail for both of us giving our new e-mail addresses; we would not necessarily need access to Enron's e-mail.  I have already activited the "out of office assistant" on my e-mail giving a forwarding e-mail address and instructing those with Enron business to contact Liz Taylor in Greg Whalley's office; I'll do the same for Jeff.  We'd like to have that activated through 10/31/01.
 
 Thanks for your assistance, Jenny.  Please let me know if there is anything further I need to do to make this happen.  SRS
