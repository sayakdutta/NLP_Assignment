 speed on the India situation in case a new deal should arise there that 
 requires RAC input. He is a sharp guy with lots of project finance experience 
 and also worked in London for Eastern.  If you don't want him involved and a 
 transaction arises it will be difficult to get someone up to speed quickly, 
 given the complexities. Rick
