 
 Hour ending 3 for 5 mw's has been confirmed with HLP.
 HE 3  was 60 mw's originally,  but was cut intra hour.   The integrate mw's are 10mw'w and are reflected on revised oasis request 4405.
 
 HLP agrees with this.

 HE3 & HE5 ARE IN QUESTION
 
 I've already checked the quantities on the preschedule....The hourly deals (allegedly) for HE 3 & 6 are in question.
 
 OUR OASIS requests indicate 5 Mwh for HE3 & some other quantity (either 0 or 10--indicating a potential cut--the original deal was for 60).  The Oasis request will shed some light on this. 
 
 So we have for HE3 & 5:
 
 Our OASIS requests
 Deals entered in Enpower
 Deals entered in the P&L sheet.
 
 Call HL&P & see if they show anything ABOVE & BEYOND the preschedule for these hours.  I'll be back around 1pm & we can finish this and the minor price discrepancies.
