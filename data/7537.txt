 
 Bobbie,
 
 Sally is on vacation this week, but she can be available for that meeting 
 unless she has to travel to NYC next week.  I will put it on her calendar & 
 will confirm with you as soon as I know more (Monday at the latest).
 
 Thanks,
 Patti x39106

 I am trying to arrange a time for a meeting to discuss Dick Amabile and we 
 need to have Drew Lynch who is in London and Beth Tilney who will be in  
 Nantucket call in for this meeting.
 
 The only time that Cindy has that looks like it might work  and also works 
 for Drew & Beth is 
 
   Thursday, July 20, 2000
   8:00 - 9:00 a.m. (Houston Time)
   Location of Meeting: 50M Dining Room
 
 Would you please let me know at your earliest convenience if this time works 
 for you.
 
 Thank you
