 Barring any construction mishaps, the big tv will go into the wall this weekend.  As a result, Matt plans to have people over on Sunday for a Band of Brothers finale party.  I'll give you more details later but wanted to let you both know that you are especially invited(as is Robbie Mac).
 
 How was last night?  Lots of trick or treaters?
