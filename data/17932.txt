 credit card bill?  They can find each and every receipt, who signed it, etc., 
 so that we can make sure they don't screw us.  I'll bring my stuff over 
 tonite.  If they've double billed us, I'm going to suggest that they owe us a 
 comp up there.   No worries, though.  They've got the paper work, and if 
 we've paid twice, they're just going to need to credit my card.  No big 
 deal.  Just a hassle having to deal with 'em.  You around tonite?

 We definitely need to see the paperwork since we already paid a bill of at
 least that much so far.  Don't worry, though we will make sure that you
 don't get stuck with anything and work it all out.

 Hi.  I've got all the paperwork.  The bill (on my bill) for you guys is
 $740.  I'll get you the paperwork tonite.  Sorry for the mix-up  (should I
 ask Squaw for a discount due to all the mess!?!?).
 
 Best,
 Jeff
