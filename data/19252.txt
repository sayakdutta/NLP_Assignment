 
 Sorry that I've been incommunicado.  At the UC Berkeley conference yesterday, 
 and on my way to an AB 1890 meeting to present on gas in about 5 minutes.  
 Got your message re: PR firm.  Sounds good.  When I'm back in tomorrow, I'll 
 fill you in on yesterday's conference and today's meeting.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
