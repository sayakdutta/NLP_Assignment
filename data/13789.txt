 Yes, this mail never works right from home.  
  
 Michelle Cash needs to sign off on anyone asking for access that doesn't meet the requirements.  Since Mike is a temporary employee, he doesn't meet the criteria.  Via this email, I'll ask Michelle to approve or decline.
  
 Thanks,
 Kathy

 Kathy -- we have a summer intern who needs to connect wtih specific groups.  In order to do this, he needs access to org charts.  Therefore, would you please set him up with a # to access ExpertFinder?  Thanks.
