 
 Attached is the referenced counterparty approval list.  Per earlier emails, 
 no U.S. counterparty should be approved for european power until we hear 
 otherwise.
 
 Also, per my email yesterday, CMS Marketing, Services & Trading Company was 
 already approved yesterday to do basis financial.  All other prior approvals 
 for that counterparty should stay the same.
