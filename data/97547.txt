 1. As you indicated, "Yes" to the approver role, the form must be submitted 
 by someone at the appropriate approval level you are requesting. In this 
 instance, Mr.Richard Sanders or someone above him in your group, would be the 
 person to submit your request
 3. The aforementioned submitter must indicate their approval of your 
 projected role as an Approver within the body of the email. This indication 
 need be no more than the words: "I approve." placed in the body of the email.
 
 We will begin processing your request just as soon as receive your amended
