 
 I understand there is a little confusion regarding what products we can trade 
 under the "Master Master"  for the referenced Counterparty.  It's not 
 surprising, it's a confusing master!  This is currently the only agreement we 
 have in place that contains terms for trading both physical and financial 
 transactions in one agreement.
 
 There is a Master Trading Agreement dated February 22, 1996 in place between 
 ECT and  AIG Trading Corporation, now known as Sempra Energy Trading Corp. 
 (Global Contract Reference No. 96000160).  This agreement provides for 
 financial Swap, Option and Swaption transactions (excluding weather), and 
 further provides for physical natural gas transactions only.  It does not 
 provide for any other physical products.
