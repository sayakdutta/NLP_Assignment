 Sara,
 
 Please advise if you are still the lawyer who reviews RMT masters, when requested for preparation.
 
 If so, Legal has been requested to prepare an ISDA between RMT and Enron Japan Corp., which shall support their FX transactions.
 
 Let me know, so I can pass this draft on to you for review.
 
 Thanks.
 
 Cordially,
