 Richard,
 
 You and I have spoken about the costs in this case previously.  Matt and I 
 have asked our various attorneys/experts to bill us monthly from this point 
 forward, in order to get a better handle on those costs.
 
 Matt has offered to be the "billing contact" for all our attorneys/experts.  
 I am also available to do the same thing, although I obviously would have to 
 charge my time for it.  I do think that a central billing contact is a good 
 idea.
 
 Please let Matt and me know how you want to proceed with this.
 
 Britt
