 Here is a letter detailing what I feel our response should be. It makes no 
 absolute statement regarding pricing errors, but does commit to the validity 
 of "in the market" online trades. I do want to check the audio tapes to 
 review exactly what the trader said, before we send anything back. I feel 
 this letter highlights the difference between the situation on June 1 and the 
 other events. I also feel this should significantly quiet their stance.
