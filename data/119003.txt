 Please find attached a revised draft of the Bridge (both clean and marked
 up).  I am also attaching a copy, for information, of a memorandum to ISDA's
 Energy and Developing Products Committee, which is meeting tomorrow, and a
 copy of a slide presentation that I will be using at that meeting.
 
 I encourage you to review the revised draft of the Bridge, and to provide me


 convenient.
 
 Kind regards,
 
 John.
