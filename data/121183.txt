 Not too many questions - I think just one.  What is the location?  Thanks!
 
  
     
 Kelli,
 
 While on my adventures west yesterday, Burbank and Pasadena expressed some interest in the Peaker product that Lucci and Fuller were peddling a month or two ago.  Burbank is interested in looking at a 30 day call out of 365 days (Cal 02) for 5000.  Pasadena would like to look at 10 days out of the winter.  They just want indications for comparison to regular calls.
 
 I know you will have questions - please come by and we can talk about them.  I left my notebook at home and feel lost today.
 
 thanks,
 Kim
