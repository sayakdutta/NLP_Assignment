    Good Morning!  
 
    I was wondering if you all would be interested in going in together to buy 
 a 
    gift for Bob Hall.   I have picked out a little something that I thought 
 he would 
    like for home or office.  Take a look and tell me what you think, asap.  
 
    This is completely optional, I thought it might help some of you (like me) 
 who 
    have no idea what to get him.  If we all went in on it, it would cost us 
 $17.00 each.
