 ABX1 1 (Keeley) Regarding long term contracts with DWR was heard in
 Senate Energy today for the purpose of considering amendments.  The
 following items were discussed:
 
 The portion of the bill that would make entities who sell to the DWR
 regulated utilities will be amended.  This was not the intent of the
 author.
 
 The $.5.5 will be amended as the author and committee acknowledged that
 it was completely impractical.  No indication as to what the new number
 would be, although it is likely that there will be a number versus being
 silent on the issue.
 
 The bill will be amended to allow for portfolio purchases.
 
 The bill will be amended to eliminate the prohibition on the state
 owning T&D.
 
 The five year sunset review may be reduced to a hard three year sunset.
 
 According to the author, it is not the intent of the bill to enable IOUs
 to repay past debts with surplus revenue if the state is able to buy
 inexpensive power and there was room under the existing cap.  Consumer
 advocates believe under this scenario there should be a rate reduction.
 
 QF contracts are a major stumbling block as they have not been paid by
 the IOUs and would prefer to have contracts with the state.  Under this
 scenario, the $400 million would be far too small a number to make up
 the net short.  Current negotiations with the IOUs have ground to a
 halt.
 
 Several parties suggested that the DWR also be authorized to make gas
 purchases.
 
 The Calpine proposal of 2,500 mw at 5.5 was deemed insufficient due to
 its complex structure, thereby reinforcing the notion that 5.5 is not
 feasible.
