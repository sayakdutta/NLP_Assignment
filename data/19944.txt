 You might add the following:
 
 Utility Processing Risk  -  will the utilities try to reject contracts that
 are pre-Sept 20 but which are DASR'd afterwards for one reason or another,
 or will the utilities try to impose other restrictive requirements to limit
 the number of post July 1 contracts they must switch to DA?
 
 Confidentiality Issues _ As part of their policing responsibility on this
 issue, the utilities will likely try to insist on seeing all post July 1 DA
 contracts, including sensitive provisions, and we will have to resist giving
 sensitive commercial information.

 Before providing more elaborate descriptions, wanted to try to get a
 complete--but stripped-down--list of the key risk areas.  Please add
 anything I may have missed, send it back, and I'll take a shot at
 fleshing it out.
 
 Thanks,
 Jeff
