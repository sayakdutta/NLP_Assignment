 
 Attached is the updated scores.  Please check your scores to verify 
 accuracy.  As the scores stand now, Joey will win no matter what and the 
 second place race is between Chuck and Wolfe.  If Arizona loses, Wolfe takes 
 second and if Arizona wins, it goes to the tiebreaker.  The rest of us are 
 out of it.  If you have 0 all the way out, it means you do not have any teams 
 remaining.  By the way - nice score Lenhart(we will see if we can get you a 
 charitable deduction for your $10).
