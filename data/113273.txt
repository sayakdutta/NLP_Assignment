 Please examine closely the attached note from the CalPX.  In the letter
 they appear to want some guidance on how to allocate the refunds to
 buyers or they'll simply decide.  This is a quote ---
 
 d.	Allocation of refunds to demand (buyers).  As part of these
 proceeding the method of allocation of refunds to buyers must be
 addressed.  CalPX proposes to use its share-fraction allocation method
 to determine how to spread the refunds among its participants if there
 are no specific Commission orders on how to allocate the refunds.
 
 Please let me know the implication and if the CAISO has a similar
 provision in its tariff.
