 To be clear, we agreed that if the contract language was modified, it would be loose enough to support a mark this time but should not be used as the model.  We did not agree, though, that this in any way limited our risk from a business perspective.  I'm no trader, but my understanding is we have effectively sold the customer a call that we have to somehow hedge against?  Again, we can mark and support what business decision is made, I just did not want there to be any impression that accounting had opined on the business valuation post year 1.

 Janet																				We are proceeding with the contract changes that were discussed with Jim Brown and we have told the customers that the document should be ready for their review early next week. Are you still okay with us proceeding as we had discussed at the offsite?
 
     
 Guys -
 
 I am not comfortable leaving the appropriations risk "grey", as it has been referred to.  The risk is there and it is real.  If the EES Executive Comittee is comfortable with this strategy/approach then I would expect to have something in writing between EES and EWS releasing EWS of any and all $$ reponsibility associated with this potential, yet unmentioned, risk.
 
 FYI, last time we priced this risk we came up with a notional value of $5MM.
 
 I am on board with providing aggressive pricing and trying to enter new markets.  However, we need to recognize all the risks.
