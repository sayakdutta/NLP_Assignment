 
 Roberto, 
 
 These are good questions, and, in fact, are ones to which I am not certain of 
 the answer (at least for #2).  Let's get together next week to discuss the 
 specifics of how this program works and then determine the issues.
 
 Twanda, would you please set up this meeting for me?
 
 Thanks.  Michelle

 Enron will be implementing the Mailsweeper software shortly.  This 
 application is primarily designed for email scanning/content filtering.  We 
 have the following outstanding issue that need to be addressed before this 
 application goes into production.
 
 1. Legal disclaimer for out going mail.  (Propose verbiage listed below)
 
 IMPORTANT: THIS DOCUMENT IS NOT A BINDING CONTRACT. ENRON DOES NOT CREATE ANY 
 CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS BY TRANSMISSION OF THIS EMAIL.  THIS MESSAGE IS INTENDED 
 ONLY FOR THE USE OF THE INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY TO WHICH IT IS ADDRESSED, AND 
 MAY CONTAIN INFORMATION THAT IS PRIVILEGED, CONFIDENTIAL, AND EXEMPT FROM 
 DISCLOSURE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.  IF THE READER OF THIS MESSAGE IS NOT THE 
 INTENDED RECIPIENT OR THE EMPLOYEE OR AGENT RESPONSIBLE FOR DELIVERING THE 
 MESSAGE TO THE INTENDED RECIPIENT, YOU ARE HEREBY NOTIFIED THAT ANY 
 DISCLOSURE, DISSEMINATION, DISTRIBUTION, OR COPYING OF THE COMMUNICATION IS 
 STRICTLY PROHIBITED.  IF YOU HAVE RECEIVED THIS EMAIL TRANSMISSION IN ERROR, 
 PLEASE IMMEDIATELY NOTIFY THE SENDER BY TELEPHONE SO THAT WE CAN ARRANGE FOR 
 ITS RETURN.      
 
 2. Under the new setup, all out-going mail (including remote sites i.e 
 London) will be routed through Houston, processed through Mailsweeper and 
 then sent to its final destination.  How can be sure that we are not in 
 violation of a foreign country's privacy laws?
 
 Your comments on these issue is greatly appreciated.
 
 Regards,
 Roberto DeLeon
