 
 Matt,
 
 I did send on your email to 3 people at EBS:   Ken Rice, CEO; David Cox, MD; 
 and Kevin Garland, VP of investments.  They are all out of the office thru 
 next week.   If you don't hear back from someone in a couple of weeks, please 
 let me know.
 
 Thanks and good luck.  Say hello to my good friend Robin.
