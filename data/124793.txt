 Darin,
 
 I liked the services portion of the night discussion note that you wrote on the 13th, but you need more information on sales on behalf of EPE for both HE 6 and HE 7...you need to explain any sales to marketers or utilities. I also need you to only sell to a marketer as last resort. A marketer is usually just flipping EPE's energy and is taking your spread. 
 
 If you have any questions, just let me know. Otherwise keep up the good work!
 
 Thanks,
 Bill
