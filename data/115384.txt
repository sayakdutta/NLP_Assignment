 Kate,
 
 Thanks again for the info.  It just occurred to me that we should probably 
 get this on the first or second workday of the month to get the last days of 
 the previous months' prices (we have to send an end of month report to 
 customers), or as soon as all of the prices are available.  Is that doable?
 
 Caroline
