 
 Susan I would love to  - but as usualy I cant - I have a Dinner Scheduled 
 with Greg at APB Monday - and I am trying not to schedule more than one night 
 per week for outings... Sorry - I really am - I would love to catch up - on 
 your trip , on you , everything - 
  Also - I dont want you to think that I am ever taking advantage of you - 
 just like me know how much money I owe you for the Baby Basket.
  My house is still in working progress , but I got a few more things since 
 you have been there, drapes , chairs, decorations, etc - and I LOVE IT- I 
 cant wait to show you.  
  And FYI   _ - I MISSED YOU - You can never never go away that long again.
  Can I call you this evening on my way home?  Or you going to be busy?
