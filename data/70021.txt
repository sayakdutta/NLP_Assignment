 presentation, although I've worked with Herman, Roger and David on these 
 issues.  I'm sure they would be glad to give the presentation again for 
 others with a need to understand the complexities of off balance sheet 
 treatment of power plants.

 related to our power plant development and sale activities.
 
 Our presentation will be based upon the following attachment.  
 
 Hard copies will be available tomorrow in 38C2.

 Could you check with David and see if he could fax copies of the PowerPoint 
 plates to me in Portland so we have a fighting chance of following along by 
 tying in by phone?    If that is possible, try to send them by Tuesday. Thank 
 you very much.
