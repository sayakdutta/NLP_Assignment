 Errol,
 
 Please review the following file (the tab marked "2001 Summary") and help me 
 answer the following questions for March:
 
 1.  Two additional originations "corrections" of $379.50 each were granted to 
 Mexico, but I don't think they belong to us.
 
 2.  The $338,955 Vitro Corporativo Deal #QW8224 was not granted to Mexico, 
 but my originator, Agustin Perez, says it should have been.  Please let me 
 know if you are responsible for this deal.
 
 I will be in Monterrey from Wednesday through Friday but will be checking my 
 voicemails & e-mails periodically, so please feel free to contact me.
 
 Thanks,
 
 NHV
