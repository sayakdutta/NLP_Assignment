 
 I was very worried last night.  David's note made it seem like something had happened.  I didn't know my phone was out.  I hardly use it...i'm really not a phone person.  But when I realized it was out yesterday...cingular was closed and i couldn't call.  John is getting in today.  I am doing a fun run tomorrow morning and we will be in the rest of the weekend.  I should get the phone taken care of later this afternoon.  This evening I have another broker dinner.  I will try to call before I got to that.   Talk to you later.
 
  
     
 I called you Wednesday night and got the message that your phone was
 disconnected.  When I got the same message on Thursday, I got worried.  I
 called John's phone and left a message.  Hope you get reconnected soon.
 David and I are thinking of going to Ft. Sam tomorrow morning.  Need to buy
 some things on post.  Will talk to you this evening.
 
 Love you much,
 Mom
