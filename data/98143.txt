 
 By copy of this e-mail, I have asked Linda Guinn to pull the Tapes before 
 they are deleted. Can you work with Linda and Ed to pinpoint the tapes we 
 need to pull. Linda's direct no. is 713-853-6104.
 
 
 
 


    
 
 
 Richard, did you ever have a chance to pull the July, Aug. phone tapes for
 Ed Baughman? While we are waiting on service on Calpine I would like to go
 ahead and review them if possible.
 
  Do you have lunch plans today? If not, do you want to meet at the new Post
 Oak Grill (under Reliant's building) for a quick bite to eat?  Let me know.
 Laura
