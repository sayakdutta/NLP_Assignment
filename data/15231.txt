 
 thanks
 
     
 
 I've thought about you a few times in the last few months, didn't want to intrude upon an already bad situation with my bullshit questions.  I'm hearing some pretty depressing stuff from the people I know at ENE.
  
 I wish I had the capital to open my own shop?there will be talent and opportunity a plenty on the market soon.  I'll ask around?I've got some friends at Duke and Dynegy from B-school, the Gianoucous (spelling??) brothers (John and Dimitri?from elementary school) started their own outfit a while back, and my old man is at Schlumberger and has good contacts in general (if you aren't married to a trading environment).
  
 Give me a few days, and I'll be in touch.
