 Jeff,
 
 Here are some suggestions:
 
 11 Sonoma Patio
 3 Walla Vista         These 3 are nearby each other-
 4 Sacramento Patio  <--this one has hot tub-all have lots
                        of patio space.
 19 Brighton Avenue   <--In Bolinas, but it would fit
                         everyone in one house.
 
 I will not be in on Wednesday or Thursday, so ask for Sarah if you call
 then.
 
 Thanks,
 Sam
