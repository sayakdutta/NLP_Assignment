 Craig there is no old or new business on New Power at this time on the contracts listed below.
 
 NNG's Bear Paw contracts 102518 and 104442 has a nomination every month and predict one for Dec.
 
 NNG's Enovate contracts have no old or new business at this time.

 I just got off the phone Paul Cherry and there is an exposure issue with 3 affiliate shippers: Bear Paw, Enovate and The New Power Company.  Please check with the schedulers (if any) and determine if these contacts have been previously nominated upon.  Also, it is important that, if they nominate from this date forward, the activity is approved through Paul Cherry (may require pre-payment).  Thanks
