 Ellen,
 
 If we don't assign the ENA Master, the confirm will need to be a GTC Dedicated Reserves confirmation.
 
 John - Can you provide the Meter Name, number and working interest?

 John,
 
 Do we need to send out Revised Master under ENA Upstream Company LLC ?
 Otherwise we have to send out a revised Confirmation under GTC.
 
 Please let me know.
 
 Thanks,

 The Stevens Oil & Gas deal (06/01/01 - 05/30/02 - Sitara # 892828)) was only entered in the system today. Mary (Terry) Franklin entered it, but under John Grass instructions they entered it under ENA Upstream Company LLC  -  we need to send out revised Confirmation.
 
 The question is, do we need to revise the Master to ENA Upstream too  -  John ?
 
 Regards,
 Ellen
 
  
     
 
      The attached confirms/ contracts have been sent to Stephen DeBrular / Stevens Oil
