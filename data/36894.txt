 I was traveling on Friday.  The Doubletree is the closest.  I'll get you a number.  Dinner on Monday is a good idea.  If you have a 5:30pm flight, leaving the office at 3:00pm will give you enough time to return a car and get to the terminal.

 Is the closest hotel to the Enron office the Doubletree?  Do you have an
 address or phone number?
 
 I was thinking that perhaps we should plan to have dinner on Monday evening.
 This would be a good opportunity to get acquainted.  Are you available?
 Please let me know as we have not made our airline reservations.
 
 I think we will take the 5:30 flight back to Minneapolis.  I assume that we
 should plan to leave the office no later than 3:00.  Will this work or do we
 need to leave earlier?
