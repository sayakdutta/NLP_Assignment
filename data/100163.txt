 
 I'm in a really sour mood.
 I wish I wasn't so tired all of the time!
 I don't think there is a minute in any day that I don't feel like I'm going to fall asleep.
 It's the "pits"
 I almost called last night around 10:00 pm to just talk, but I figured that I shouldn't bother anyone if I'm feeling sorry for myself.
 I know I'm not real good at returning calls and following up on things.
 My excuse is that I'm always exhausted
 I feel like I must be doing something wrong since no one else seems to be like this.
 I do appreciate your friendship, and regret everything you have to put up with!
  
 ENE is down $1.42 right now!
 No news that I know of?
 The DOW is down (113) right now.
 It appears that things may be escalating in Afghanistan.
 I think the Special Forces are close.
  
 Have fun at Jackson Hole!
