 Sally,
 This is the communication summary we discussed.  I have detail behind the steps if you have any questions or would like to see more.  
 
 Please note that the "Management Closing Meeting" is referring to the meetings w/you and Wes that Bauer/Sorrells have been conducting in the past.
 
 Thank you.
 Mechelle
