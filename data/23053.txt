 I have reviewed your public information, and feel you may have interest in a concept that we have developed to secure nonqualified executive benefits. The concept, which we have trade marked, the Secured Trust  may provide the maximum protection to executive's retirement and deferred compensation benefits, without a charge to corporate earnings.
 Our organization has been on the forefront with these innovative designs. Our clients are many of the Fortune 1000. 
 I would like to have an opportunity to share this information with you, and also give you a copy of our "Best Practices Report", on non-qualified deferred compensation plans. Please let me know if you have interest.
