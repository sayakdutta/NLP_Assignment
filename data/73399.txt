 Chris, per our conversation this afternoon, this e-mail will document the
 fact that, due to travel schedules, NorthWestern is unable to obtain the
 necessary officer signatures for the incumbency documents requested by
 Citibank as part of establishing the escrow arrangement called for under the
 Letter Agreement.  You agreed that NorthWestern could complete the necessary
 paperwork with Citibank on Tuesday of next week.  Thanks again for your
 flexibility.
