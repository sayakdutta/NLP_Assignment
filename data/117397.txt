 and sent it to Alan.

 Hi guys,
 
 Louise was concerned that CommodityLogic might not have borrowed the latest 
 edition of EOL documents for use on the CommodityLogic website.  Could I 
 please ask you two to ensure that we are using the latest legal stuff.  I am 
 not sure who actually holds the definitive copy of the latest EOL legal 
 docs...
 
 Thanks very much,
 
 Tom
