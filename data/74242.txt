 I would think cocktail attire.  What time are the receptions?
 
 
    
  
 This seminar that Ric is going to in Las Vegas is having cocktail receptions 
 each evening and special shows by Dana Carvey and Penn and Teller.  There's 
 no dress specified, so I'm assuming something nice but not overdone.  What 
 would you think?
