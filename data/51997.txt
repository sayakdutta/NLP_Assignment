 No problem. I asked Shirley to reschedule.

 Vince-
 
 I apologize, but something has come regarding this afternoon. My server's OS 
 is acting up, and is affecting all of my apps right now.
 
 Can we think about later this week? I promise it will be worth it to you. The 
 EOL stuff is nice.
 
 Again, my apologies.
 
 Clayton
