 Please send a copy of the executed document to Tanya Rohauer.  We will review the amendment but need the original document.

 All:
 
 Just spoke with Harvard's lawyer Kim Noble who appreciated speaking with Bill earlier this week.
 
 ENE has triggered an Additional Termination Event under the ISDA (commercial paper rating at A-2 and ENE placed on "watch" status) but Harvard does not want to terminate. 
 
 Harvard will propose an amendment to the effect that our Threshold will drop to 0 as long as a short term rating is at A-3.
