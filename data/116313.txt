 
 I'm sorry, but I can't give you full credit on your answer to the second part 
 of my question. The correct answer was the author's use of the word 
 "stunning" to describe the $6.2 billion figure. The word is clearly an 
 editorialization on the amount of the refund requested, and is therefore 
 journalistically incorrect.  In addition, you failed to extemporize on why a 
 journalist for an energy trade magazine would leave such gaping holes in 
 his/her story. 
 
 But because I'm feeling lenient this morning, I'll give you the details.
 
 There was no date.
