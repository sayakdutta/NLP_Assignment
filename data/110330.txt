 
 um, are you serious about the cat thing because now i'm a little disgusted...
 
 
     
 
 yes, you were a little intoxicated when we spoke last night, but you were
 sweet.  That is kind of creepy that it is a full moon on Halloween.  I need
 to keep my cat inside because people steal cats on Halloween and skin them.
 Well buck up little camper, in the scope of everything, things really aren't
 that bad.  You could have to have life altering surgury.  Since this thing
 with my family, it really has put a lot of things into perspective.  I hope
 you feel better.  Call me later.
 
 Love,
 Laurel
 
 
     
 
 i feel a little awful...plus i'm tired.  I hope you weren't looking
 forward to speaking with a sober Mat yesterday.  i don't think i was
 that drunk, but who knows.  plus, i must be allergic to something
 because i can't stop sneezing.  oh, my life just sucks these days...j/k.
 anyway, are you looking forward to tonight...especially with a nice full
 moon...make sure to look out for the goblins... 
 
 
     
 
 Happy Halloween!
