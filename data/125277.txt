 
 Alton,
 
 Thanks for the concern. Fortunately, I transferred to one of Enron's pipeline companies in mid-September (just before things started getting really crazy). This is the most stable part of the company and we will survive no matter what ... although we may be owned by someone other than Enron. I was also fortunate to have very little Enron stock exposure. Many of my friends have not been so fortunate. They are losing their jobs plus they've lost most of their net worth.
 
 Andersen is tight lipped because their butts are on the line also. I don't understand how they could have allowed Enron to guarantee so much debt and then keep it off-balance sheet.
 
 Are you all going to Port Neches for Thanksgiving? Renee and I are going tonight. I hope that you all have a very nice Thanksgiving and Christmas.
 
 Many Happy Returns,
 
 Paul
 
 
 
 
     
 
 Someone was asking me the other day if I had
 any friends at Enron....you came to mind!
 
 Are you weathering the storm? Unbelievable
 is the word that comes to my mind.
 
 We use Andersen also and I know they are
 quite "tight lipped" about the situation!
 
 I sincerely hope everything works out for you
 and the other Enron employees that have done
 nothing more than "bust your rears" for the good
 of the "Big E".
 
 Stay in touch,
 
 Alton D. Heckaman, Jr.
