 Yes, I do have time on Wednesday afternoon and would like to meet with you.  Might you be available anytime after 2:00pm?  
  
 Thanks, Kim.

 Please see attached proposal per our discussion regarding transportation on NNG.  Please call to discuss when you have a few minutes.  I intend to be in Houston next Wednesday, if you would like to discuss in person.  Let me know if you have a few minutes and I will try and meet up with you.
