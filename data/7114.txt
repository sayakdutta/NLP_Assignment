 Hi Don.
 
 Were you going to send the trades?
 I thought that maybe you meant to attach them, but left them off.

       Can you please send your hourly trades for November 5 (yesterday).
       There was a problem with our/my e-mail system and I did not get your
       trades.
       It seems to be working now.
 
       Thanks,
