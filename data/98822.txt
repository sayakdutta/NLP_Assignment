 How about 1:30 p.m. your time, or any time after that? 
 
 The Baltimore meeting won't happen, but there is some background.? That's one 
 of the things we want to talk about. 
 
  
     
 
 I am around all day tomorrow. Please leave me a voicemail re when you want 
 to talk. Also-- any luck on my proposed meeting w/the Legg Mason?
