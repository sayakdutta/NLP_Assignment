 Plano/Pontiac as compared to the Peakers.

 Folks:
 
 Please note in my e-mail below that we need to go live with this by April 2. 
 This means that we all need to work together to make this happen. I would 
 like to see a comprehensive index of all documents we intend to include ASAP. 
 This list should include site plans and other drawings that we've spent a lot 
 of money on. 
 
 I look forward to reviewing this list.
 
 Regards,
 
 Ben
