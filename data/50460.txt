 
 Jim,
 
 CHARM looks more like  a prototype that requires a lot of work to make it 
 more a
 production tool.
 
 We have developed a similar model (without some nice functionalities CHARM 
 has)
 in about two weeks, at request of Rick Jones who joined EES from HSB. Rick
 worked on a similar model at his old company  and wanted to have a similar 
 tool
 for his projects with Enron. I can tell you more about it when we meet 
 (hopefully) later
 this week. 
 
 I would tell Willis that the model requires more work before Enron can
 consider it as commercial product.

 Vince, what feedback should I give Willis on their CHARM product?
