 Further to my discussion with Tim Nakaska, I confirm that we have $84,508.39 
 in
 out trust account as at March 28, 2000.
 We have retained an amount of $47,000 relating to the Canada Customs & Revenue
 Agency's trust claim, pending final determination as to entitlement.
 We prepared a wire transfer of the US dollar equivalent of $35,000 CDN to the
 same account as we transferred  funds to in September 1999.
 The balance of  $2,508.39 has been retained  in our trust account to cover
 incidentals. I am faxing our standard enclosure letter to your attention.
 
 If you require any further information, please advise.
 
 Regards,
 
 Tom
