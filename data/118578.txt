 Would you be okay if our group organized a lunch for Bill and the credit 
 group to celebrate his promotion?  It could alos serve the purpose perhaps of 
 catching up with them on the latest issues.  Let me know what you think.  In 
 lieu of going out, I was thinking that Suzanne could arrange to have it 
 catered by someone that serves good food.
