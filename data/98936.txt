 the open subpoena from the CPUC and the fact that we have been sued. Gary 
 Fergus is going to draft a memo for your signature.

 we are about to move a bunch of desks up here.  as people move their desks, 
 they will surely be going through old files and reports.  i want to make sure 
 that we are in compliance with data and file retention policies.  could you 
 please advise me on the need to send out a communication reiterating what the 
 hard copy retention policy is?
