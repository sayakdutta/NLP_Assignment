 Can you send them 2 months' rent and tell them the person from Enron who needs to sign the lease is out of the country? Or if you want , I will bring a check up to Sacramento on Wed to pay them. Let me know today as I am flying to SFO late today.

 Mike,
 
 I assume that you are in charge of the finalizing of the repository lease,
 and that you will be in touch with the folks at the building regarding
 status.  I am not sure how long we can go without sending them a check.
 
 Let me know if you need my help.

 If possible, don't sign a lease until I get back. If you need a immediate
 answer, let me know.

    Mike,
 
    I understand that you will be signing the lease for the repository.
    Attached please find (1) the lease, (2) attachment A to the lease, and
    (3)
    an outstanding invoice.
 
    Please note, I spoke with Tracy Wilson today at the Capitol Mall
    Executive
    Center.  She is expecting early next week the signed lease as well as
    the
    rent payment reflected in the invoice.
 
    Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
    Peter Meringolo
