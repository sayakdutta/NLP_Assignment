 
 yep.  looks like i found the formula.
 
  
     
 are you having a better day today?
 
 
     
 
 you are so mean.  why can't you be sweet like me?
 
     
                 
    whatever, i know you were kidding, so was i.
 
    
                 
 
    just kidding.  you need to relax a little.
 
        
                             
       you are a jerk
 
       
                             
 
       i am going to the strip club.  do you want to meet me there?  i will
    get
       you a lap dance.
 
           
                                         
           you'll be fine
 
          
                                         
 
          i resent that too
 
              
                                                     
             why? it's true.  i resent the fact that you can't be honest
    with
       me
 
             

                                        
 
             i resent that last comment

                   whatever, from now on i just won't listen to anything you
       say.
          i
                will
                   consider everything that comes out of your mouth
    worthless.
