 Attached is an executed copy of the Services Agreement for the Independent

 Would you please prepare a form of agreement for ERMT LLC?  We would like
 to get both signed up today.  Note that we are changing ERMT LLC's name to
 NETCO Holdings LLC.
 
 Thanks,
 Trish.

 Dear Trish:
 
 Attached is a draft of our Services  Agreement for CGNN Holding Company,
 Inc.  If this form is acceptable I will  draft a similar agreement for ERMT
 LLC (modified to include the non-economic  member).
 
 The independent director for ERMT LLC will  be Bernard J. Angelo and the
 golden shareholder will be GSS Contract Services I,  Inc., a Delaware
 corporation.
 
 Please feel free to call me with any  questions or comments that you may
 have.
 
 Best regards.
