 It seems that there may be an Internet bias as well (more affluent 
 and educated households are on-line).
 
 One solution: develop a control group. Arm-twist clerical 
 employees of the School to fill out the questionnaire
 and also ask them to provide the questionnaire to their friends  and families.
