 Apparently there are some problems regarding cutting checks for some of the Kern producers.  As such, we have to switch the letters around to reflect wire transfers.  In the case of The pertinent information for the letters requiring revision is as follows:
 
 1) Kennedy Oil
 First Interstate Bank of Commerce
 Gillette Branch
 ABA# 102300129
 Account# 362170342
 
 2) J.M. Huber Corporation
 ABA: 021000089
 Acct: 00050892
 
 3) Patina Oil & Gas Corporation
 Wells Fargo Bank, Seattle
 ABA: 121000248
 Acct. 4296915515
 
 4) FMI Weld
 The only thing that needs to change is the account number.  The correct number is:
 1018233241
 
 The letters will have to reflect payment as of tomorrow.  I'll call you shortly to follow up.
 
 Thanks.
