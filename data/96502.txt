 Attached is a draft letter for your consideration.  Our outside counsel 
 believes a letter like this would help us in our position that we do not have 
 to continue buying energy when there is no transfer capability at the SDP 
 because we know TVA will reject it.  Sending this letter is not critical to 
 the sucess of our position but would bolster it somewhat.  Before deceiding 
 to sent or not, I wanted your thoughts on how you think that giving this 
 information to TVA would impact us, particularly given TVA's actions today, 
 re acces to transmission through third party transactions.  Lets discuss this 
 afternoon.
 
 Thanks
