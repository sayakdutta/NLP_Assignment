 
 I would like to request a temporary increase of the Natural Gas var limit for 
 the next 10 business days.  I suggest Natural Gas Trading's limit increase to 
 45 Million limit from the current 40 Million limit.  The floor is very 
 bullish and we don't want to take off our West Basis positions which are 
 eating up a lot of var.
 
 Please advise.
