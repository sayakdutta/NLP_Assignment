 Tino's new number is 913-441-1800 (ext. 109).  Thanks Kevin and have a great 
 holiday!!

 I left Steve Thome (503-539-2340) in Portland a voice msg on this.  He is 
 travelling.  I'll check my voicemail while I'm out next week or feel free to 
 have Tino call him direct.

 Latest Tino-gram:  Apparently high power prices at 4 Corners have DOE excited 
 about the project all of a sudden.  The latest configuration is in the 
 300-380 mw range.  Tino needs us to check if the ENA guys would be interested 
 in buying the surplus capacity on a demand charge basis (I think these are 
 basically tolling agreements--ENA would pay a monthly capacity reservation 
 charge per KW of capacity and then pay actual fuel and variable cost for 
 power that is actually dispatched)  $7/kw if the thing is simple cycle or 
 $10/kw if combined cycle.  Variable cost would be $.005/kwh and fuel is 
 whatever it is--ENA's problem.   I'm trying to get ahold of Tino to confirm, 
 but I think these are prices at the plant, not FOB 4 Corners.  
 
 Please give me a call and see if you can get a quick reaction from our ENA 
 guys.  Thanks.  DF
