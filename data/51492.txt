 Here's another great service from Ynot.com:  In November, Ynot will debut 
 Audyo's! (pronounced Aud-ee-o). Audyo's feature MP3 music by real performers, 
 coupled with our great greeting card animation. Audyo's for many occasions, 
 so give them a listen!
 
 Environmentally conscious and more fun than flying a kite...Ynot.com, where 
 we put the fun in free greetings. Send your own card for absolutely nothing 
 (that means Free!) by clicking on the link below:
