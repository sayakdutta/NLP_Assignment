 For your records, here are my eol sim trades for the month of september through today.  I was out last week, but it appears that there was a trade around the 19th or 20th that i do not recall doing.  It looks like a buy of calendar 2003 of the Nymex for 5000 mmbtu per day.  I do not see this trade in my EOL transaction history.  Can you please look into this.  Thanks.
 
 Mat
