 
 Molly,
 
 Jill is a daughter of my friend. She contacted our Analyst/Associate Program
 but her background makes her a better candidate for an HR position.
 Do you know  if we are looking for somebody with her skills?

 Hi Vince,
 
 I'm Presly's daughter, Jill.  I believe that he had told you I would be
 sending my resume your way.  I am interested in the Associate HR and Analyst
 program that Enron offers.  I have actually spoken with someone in Hr
 regarding the program.  Her name is Adrianne Engel.  I have not heard from
 her any further at this point.
 
 I have been trying to get into the HR field here in Austin and it has been
 very tough in this tight market.  I would love the opportunity to interview
 with Enron.
 
 I appreciate any help you can provide.
 
 Sincerely,
 Jill Schoenemann
