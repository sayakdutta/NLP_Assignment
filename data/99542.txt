 I talked to Arvina this morning and she noticed that she has calculated the loss return using the wrong indicies.  She will be fixing that this morning.  I am attaching a summary of the loss return calculation and a quick summary of checking I did against Arvina spreadsheet.  There is a deal that we entered in differently, but the net result is the same.

 Diana,
 
 I heard back from Gwen and she has given me these deals to be fixed according to Modesto's spreadsheet.
 
 Sales
 875830.1.2 and 875819.2 Need to have a price of $29.00 11/7-11/30
 
 Purchases
 875830.3 and 875819.3 Need to have a price of $31.00 11/7-11/30
 

 
 Also, starting on the 7th we need to put in losses of 36 mw's per day using the Dow NP15 index price.
 
 let me know if you have any questions and what I can do to help.
 
 Thanks
