      RE:  Revised Form of Annex A
 
      Dear Mr. Sorenson:
 
      Your letter dated March 7, 2000 directed to the Cargill Legal
      Department regarding the above-referenced subject has been forwarded
      to me for attention.
 
      We are currently deeply involved in the negotiation of an ISDA Master
      Agreement between Enron North America Corp. and Cargill,
      Incorporation.   I have been working with Sara Shackleton, Senior
      Counsel in your Legal Department, to bring this document to
      completion.   To date, the few remaining unresolved issues require
      the involvement and response of Tanya Rohauer in your Credit area.
 
      As instructed in your letter, this is to advise that we do not accept
      the General Terms and Conditions of Confirmation and prefer to
      continue to use ISDA's recommended standard long form Confirmation
      until the ISDA Master Agreement has been completed.  Any effort on
      your part to expedite the conclusion of these negotiations would be
      greatly appreciated.
 
      Regards,
      Marty Oelmann
      Documentation Analyst
