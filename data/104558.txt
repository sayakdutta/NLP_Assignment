 
 Steve:  I don't believe that I have seen a revised forward confirmation since 
 our conversations in mid-September.  I have only a "draft" confirmation dated 
 May , 2000 which I marked and which served as the basis of further 
 discussions.  Also, I thought that CSFB was going to send language addressing 
 concerns raised by EITF Issue No. 00-19.  FYI, I have not received comments 
 from Mike Enerson.
 
 Is someone in your shop preparing a revised confirmation?  
 
 Thanks.  Sara
