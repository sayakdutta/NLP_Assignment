 I've made some changes, which I thought I would circulate internally for 
 comment before sending to GE.  
 
 I left Jeff Smith a voice mail asking how the initial payment is supposed to 
 be split between the on and offshore contracts since this document references 
 payments to both.  
 
 Comments?
