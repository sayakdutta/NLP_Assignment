As we discussed before, Unocal would need to enter directly into the FT with NNG or ENA would have to contract for the FT and then release it to Unocal pursuant to the capacity release procedures (which would include posting and bidding requirements).

 Gerald - 
 We are planning to provide a revised Term Sheet to Unocal sometime tomorrow.  Can you please review the attached revised Term Sheet and provide any comments.  It is not that different from the initial Term Sheet you reviewed and approved in September.
