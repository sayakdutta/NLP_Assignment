 
 Patti is sending you my slides for the offsite - I finally got out of meetings long enough to review them!  
 
 There will be four parts to the Mid/Back Office hour and a half on the agenda:
 
 	Global Risk Management Operations - Overview of Services (Beck providing slides)
 
 	IT Systems - Overview and Organization (Perlman providing slides) ) 
 
 	CommodityLogic Modules (Gros providing slides)  
 
 	Commercialization Effort (the three of us are working on a few slides - to come later today)
