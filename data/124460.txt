 Mark,
 
 Thanks so much for your kind hospitality.  Please thank Alicia again for me.  
 How did Lauren's play go last night?  I am getting more excited about a move 
 away from Houston, especially to Denver.  I hope you and your family have a 
 great trip and please do give us a call if you swing into Houston.  Talk to 
 you soon.
 
 Kind regards,
 
 -Larry-
