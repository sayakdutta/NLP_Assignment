 Lara: 
 
 Richard Sanders forwarded this email to me.  I spoke with Rick and he 
 suggested that I forward it to you (he mentioned that you met with Jade Eaton 
 yesterday) and that you are familiar with the Indiana investigation.
 
 Richard:
 
 Lara is our Government Affairs point person for DOJ and FTC matters, so you 
 can forward these types of requests to her in the future.
 
 Thanks Everyone.  Let me know if you need me to do anything further with this.
 
 Sarah

 Richard -- Yesterday, I received a call from Jill Ptacek, a lawyer from the
 DOJ's Antitrust Division, regarding the remaining aspects of the DOJ's
 Indiana Energy Investigation.  She has requested an interview with an Enron
 employee who can describe Enron's experience in obtaining capacity on the
 Texas Gas (Williams) and Panhandle (CMS) pipelines in Indiana.  The DOJ is
 investigating whether Proliance is using its its significant capacity rights
 on these pipelines to exclude or disadvantage third parties seeking access
 in central Indiana.  Ptacek is requesting an interview this week or next
 week.  Please let me know who we can make available for 60-90 minutes.
 Thanks. -- Paul Yde (202-639-6685)
