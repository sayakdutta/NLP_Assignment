 my return...but, I did go out a few of the nights I was in London with an 
 undergrad/grad school friend of his (among other people of course).  
 Surprise, surprise he didn't have many supportive words for Ted as dating 
 material either.  In summary he found Ted to lack attentiveness to his 
 partners and maybe even fidelity.  He said the break up of Ted's marriage 
 wasn't "ALL his fault", which is a decidedly different slant than the one Ted 
 gave me the night of our chat.  I also heard that he has worked his way 
 around Enron a bit.  All in all very disheartening information.  Regardless, 
 I'm still glad I dated him and think I learned a lot from the whole 
 situation.  Tell Brendan I said, "Hello" and good luck with the new role at 
 work.

 I have a hold on travel plans to Korea right now as work may interfere.  Oh, 
 well.
