 Hello John.  We are turning a new draft at the moment, and expect to have it 
 to you and David by the end of the week.  Let me know if you have questions 
 in the meantime.  Thanks.  --  Karen

 Hi John,
 
 Karen Jones in Portland has been working on it for ENA.  I don't know the 
 status.

 Hi, gang. Sheila called last Friday and let me know you were working on this 
 off-balance sheet EPC form, and that it was expected to be out on Friday, 
 maybe Monday for review and commment, which was needed PDQ becuase of a 
 looming project.  I have not seen any copy of the form or had any update on 
 the status of the project.
 
 Kay/Dave, could one of you send the form to me and let me know the big 
 picture status?
