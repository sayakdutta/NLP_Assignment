 Hi Vince,
 
 After we hung up the phone yesterday, I sent you an email as we
 agreed.  However today I looked in my "outbox" and see that nothing was
 sent to you.  Thus, I'm trying again.  If this is redundant, sorry.
 
 Attached is a copy of the Corporate Finance Forum I am trying to
 organize.  Any comments or suggestions you might have would be
 appreciated.  I look forward to Enron getting involved in this project if
 at all possible.
 
 Secondly, I am confirming the dates for the two visitors for the Risk
 Management chair.
 
 Philippe Jorion,  Seminar on 2/15 and dinner on 2/14
 Andrew Karolyi, Seminar on 2/23 and dinner on 2/23.
 
 Lets try to go flying sometime soon
 
 Thanks for your help and support,
 
 Dave
