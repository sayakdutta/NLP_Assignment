 I view chess as one of the incontrovertible pieces of evidence that the Peter 
 Principle is in operation in my life.  I know how all the pieces move but I 
 can't see more than one move ahead -- proving that I am basically an idiot 
 and have advanced well beyond where I long ago should have maxed out 
 professionally.  So if you want someone to use to provide nearly unlimited 
 examples of how to make mistakes in playing (while nevertheless following the 
 rules), I'm your man.

 Yes I did.  It looks great.  We will use the luggage tags as you suggested
 and will probably be able to do all carry on.  Although, if we do it will be
 a first for Amanda.  See you on Friday.  Bill
 
 P.S. Do you play chess?  I just got a travel set and was going to teach
 Amanda.  I will also have my trusty bartenders guide so I can help out with
 the "sailing."
 
 
 
     
 
 
 p.s.  Did you get the cruising guide I sent?
