 
 Carl, 
 
 Thank you for your e-mail.  Concerning Section 13.5, we will agree to New 
 York on choice of law.  For Section 2.5, ENA as confirming party.  Finally, 
 Section 3.2  we prefer Spot Price as this is a short term deal.
 
 Please let me have your thoughts regarding these issues.
 
 
 Best regards,
