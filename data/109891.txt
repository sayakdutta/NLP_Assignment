 
 Roxanne, there may be an opportunity to bring a guest, but I am waiting to 
 get RSVPs from the entire group before offering that as tickets are limited.  
 I'll be back in touch as soon as I've heard from the entire class.

 Sherri,
 
 I would definitely like to have a ticket.  Are guests invited or is it 
 limited to members of the Seal Class #64?  If guests are invited, I would 
 love to have one additional ticket.
 
 My office address is as follows:
 
 Roxanne Piper
 c/o Tucker Alan Inc.
 1415 Louisiana Street
 Suite 3250
 Houston, TX  77002
 
 Please thank Jeff for arranging this outing -- it sounds like it will be a 
 lot of fun!!  Call me at (713) 651-7217 if you have any questions.
