 the VP on my team that manages our Global Services, and this Executive Report 
 Viewer falls in that arena.  She will be closer to this than I.  You may want 
 to get her feedback as well.  --Sally 
 
 
     
 Sally,
 
 I just want to give you an update on the Executive Report Viewer project in 
 case you are not aware of the status. The development of the ERV project has 
 been completed and delivered on schedule. The feedback from the demo was very 
 positive. The application has been handed over for user acceptance test.
 
 Thanks
 
 Zhiyong
