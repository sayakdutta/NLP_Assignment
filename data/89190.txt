 Debra,
 
 Please work with Jan at AEP to establish a GISB contract between ENA
 Upstream and AEP.
 
 Jan - I have attached a sample of our GISB with special provisions for
 your review as well.
 
 Thanks,

 Attached is our standard GISB with Special Provisions.  Our Special
 Provisions add terms to permit netting, liquidation upon default,
 telephone
 recording, confidentiality, and to refine force majeure, audit rights
 and
 document priority.  Please review and let us know your comments.
 
 Attached also is our company information form for you.
 
  We look forward to hearing from you.
