 
 We'll just be doing some house shopping.  I think we're going to postpone the 
 upgrade to
 the existing house and look to buy a new house.  This would eliminate the 
 need to move
 out for 6 months.  I'm dying to live in a house that is complete.  Anyway, 
 besides this we
 don't seem to have much going on.  I'll just need to go into work for a few 
 hours on Sunday.
 
 Let me know what you want to do.
