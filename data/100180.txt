 
 If I already sent this to you just ignore this!
 I will need a new chair for the new building!
 The one I have now does not cut it.
 Please order one like I have now!
 
 	Thanks, Jim

 ONE MORE THING:
 
 Please let everyone know that the tag is for their chair to move over.  We are not getting new chairs after all.  
 Also, tell them to please leave their pink bag on their desk the day of the move.
 
 Thanks
