 
 I hear you.  Feels like I haven't slept for about a week.  
 
 Congratulations--securitization would be an extremely constructive outcome.  
 If there's anything at all that we can do to help, please don't hesitate to 
 ask.  (Since folks view us as, well, somewhat controversial, we continue to 
 try to do productive things away from the spot light.)  Talk to you soon.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
