 I know that you and I are both swamped, so I'm writing very briefly to give 
 you a brief update.  But first, thank you very much again for meeting last 
 week.  Greatly appreciated, and look forward to working together to help in 
 any way I can to find solution that is acceptable to all. Here's the update:
 
 Our "subcommitte" is meeting tomorrow to try to close the deal on a proposed 
 solution.  It focuses on 3 key areas:
 
 Using the utilities retained assets to moderate prices.
 Designing a framework for forward contracting that strikes a much more 
 appropriate balance in CA between state oversight and the need for utility 
 flexibility.
 Rate stabilization/Undercollections (utility solvency)
 
 I will update you tomorrow on the group's progress.  If thing's go according 
 to plan, we may be in a position to submit something to you a early as 
 Monday.  If there's a deadline from your end that I ought to be aware of, let 
 me know and I'll incorporate it into the subcommittee's work plan.
 
 In the meantime, if there is anything at all that I can do to help, please 
 don't hesitiate to contact me.
 
 Thanks again and all the best,
 Jeff
