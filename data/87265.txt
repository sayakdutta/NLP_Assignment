 In response to your fax of 1/12,  a draft of a Master between HPL and Admas 
 was previously sent in 1999.  I have attached this same draft for your 
 review.  Please give me a call after you have had an opportunity to reivew 
 this draft.    No additional  agreements are necessary for online trades.
