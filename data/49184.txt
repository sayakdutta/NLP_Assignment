 
 John,
 
 The outline of a message to Nesbitt.
 
 
 Dale,
 
 Thanks for your message. In our phone conversation before the meeting  you 
 mentioned 
 another contractual arrangement under which we could work with  your  company 
 employees on a case-study.
 
 The cost of a weekly project  would be $12,000 that would be applied to the 
 purchase price should
 we go ahead and decide to acquire the software. This project would allow us 
 to evaluate the model and
 come up with an estimate of the manpower necessary to support  the model 
 internally.
 
 Please, let me know more about this option.
 
 Vince
