 Thanks a bunch.

 Hi Jeff,
 
 As a member of the University Affairs department we try to capitalize on 
 opportunities that facilitate the exchange of intellectual capital.  I 
 realize that you are extremely busy, but it would be fabulous if you, or 
 someone else in your immediate department could help us answer this question 
 for the University of Liverpool.  Let me know if you think someone will have 
 the time to generate an answer to this question...obviously it is NOT a rush.
 
 Regards,
 
 Cindy

 Dear Sir/Madam,
 
 We are a small group of geography students from the University Of
 Liverpool, England.  We will be visiting Santa Cruz in April on an
 educational research visit and are  focussing our research on the current
 Californian energy crisis.  One aspect that we are considering looking at
 is effect of the energy crisis on the high-tech industries in and around
 Santa Cruz.  However, the information available at present is limited.
 Therefore, we would appreciate any help or advise you could give us or pass
 this e-mail on to somebody else who may be able to assist us.  
 
 Has the energy crisis reached Santa Cruz or Silicon Valley yet and if so
 has it/will have any affect on the high-tech industries?  Have any measures
 been taken to mitigate its effects or is it of no concern?
 
 We understand that you are very busy but would appreciate any feedback on
 this subject that you may be able to give us.
 
 Thank you for your time and we look forward to hearing from you.
 
 
 Eddie Ping, Martin Price & Ric Mason
