 FYI gents - the meeting yesterday with the Arizona DEQ did not result in significant progress. Basically the agency folks at that level are simply not motivated to engage in any effort to accelerate the permitting.  Local counsel is going to visit informally today with the agency's counsel to see if some progress can be made and attempt to set a meeting with higher level agency personnel early next week.  
 
 Attached is a copy of a hand out that was used at yesterday's meeting.
