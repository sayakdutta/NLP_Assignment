 Nothing but good news everyday. Not sure I mentioned this: kerrigan's now running non-reg finance side at txu in dallas. We started talking about possibility of txu resetting eastern contract and writing us a big check (discount for early pay to be negotiated based on size). No word yet from legal on rolling el paso - ecp swaps back into ena and arguing setoff rights to get our collateral back we are posting el paso.
