 
 Here are my initial comments:
 
 There's no clear triggering event which would expedite the internal approval 
 process.  For instance, paragraph 3 is a current obligation (re 
 landscaping).  It would be easier to process this agreement if the 
 effectiveness of this agreement commences when we  file for a building 
 permit.  I understand that we would have to pay some of this prior to the 
 time the permit is issued, but again, magic words help.
 
 Paragraph 6 on right of first refusal for power.  Looks like a free call for 
 the next 30 years.  Just want to make sure you've bought in on this.  Other 
 than the obvious valuation impact, it could impact a purchaser's ability to 
 obtain project financing.
