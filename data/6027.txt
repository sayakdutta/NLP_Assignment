 ACCUSED MOLESTER PLEADS INNOCENT IN MONTANA COURT 
    A man accused of sexually molesting a 12-year-old boy, then killing
 him and serving his body to his neighbors, has pleaded innocent in a
 Great Falls, Mont., courtroom.
    Court records indicate that the man, Nathaniel Bar-Jonah, is a
 career criminal. The 43-year-old is being held on half a million
 dollars bond.
    Police say they found notes indicating that Bar-Jonah called dinners
 cooked for friends and neighbors "little boy stews."
    He could face the death penalty if found guilty of murder and
 several other charges, including impersonating a police officer.
