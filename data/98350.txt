 This matter is riddled with insurance law and employment law issues.  If the 
 independent contractor is deemed to be an employee under Wyoming law, then 
 our insurance may come into play.  However, this has more significant 
 implications under the employment arena.  A very valid argument exists if he 
 is deemed to have been  an employee, then employment benefits may be due and 
 owing.  I am somewhat familiar with these issues as I dealt with a similar 
 issue for Enron Oil & Gas many years ago.
 
 Who should I visit with regarding employment related issues?  Furthermore, if 
 we have "independent contractors" driving their personal automobiles in 
 discharging their duties, if they do not procure the correct insurance we 
 will be facing this issue in the future. More specifically, when an 
 individual places auto insurance they must tell the insurer that they are 
 driving in their vehicle for business purposes, otherwise the insurer will 
 deny coverage on these grounds. This is one of the issues that we are facing 
 here.  
 
 I await your response.
