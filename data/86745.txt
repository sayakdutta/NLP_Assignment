 I reconciled the imbalance between Stingray and LRP, but as to who approached 
 who first, I don't remember.  It was my job to resolve all imbalance 
 discrepancies on LRP, and then give my findings to commercial.  As I was 
 working with Sherryl Cranford at Stingray, she made it clear that they were 
 anxious to get the imbalances resolved and settled as well, and that was the 
 only imbalance we discussed.  I think Sherryl and I agreed to that imbalance 
 sometime in september.  Whether or not they've been asking for the gas back 
 since February, I don't know because I didn't deal with LRP companies until 
 several months later.

 Leslie-
 
 When did we agree with El Paso/Stingray on the 11,973 dth owed to Stingray?  
 Have they been asking for this gas back since February?  Did you approach 
 them first on settling this?  The reason I'm asking these questions is that 
 HPL had a big imbalance due them from an El Paso operated line in Texas.  HPL 
 had been asking for the gas back from the beginning and El Paso finally paid 
 them back in kind this month.  I do not want to pay Stingray back in kind.  I 
 want to pay them Feb. 2000 IF NGPL-LA.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Susan
