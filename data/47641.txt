 
 I really don't know.  Maybe the icon, which is just a shortcut to the 
 database, won't work because of outlook.  I haven't had this problem with any 
 other people on outlook before.  You might want to talk to your computer 
 person.  He can probably find the database the long way.  It is just a misc. 
 Lotus Notes application.

 Tana -
 
 I am unable to access the link for the Financial Trade agreements Notes DB.  
 I am wondering if my access problems are related to the fact that I have 
 outlook and the file is searching for the notes.ini link.  I'd appreciate any 
 assistance on this.
 Thanks!
