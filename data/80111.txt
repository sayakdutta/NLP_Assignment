 Cathy,
 
 Pls provide Ono-san in Tokyo with Mike's travel details so that we can 
 arrange.
 
 Mike:  We are putting together  a presentation based on the discussion we had 
 during our call the other day.  This would be our outline (and vision) for 
 our interactive web site and how we plan to take reg/gov affairs online as 
 well as some other initiatives.  We will be able to get you  a draft of this 
 presentation before you arrive in Tokyo.  We will also look into activities 
 for the weekend.

 Joe, 
 
 I am looking forward to the upcoming trip.  
 
 Everything is all set for Korea but what do you suggest as an agenda for my 
 two days in Tokyo?  Also are there some presentations or items that i could 
 review before I arrive that you believe might be helpful?  I will also be 
 there over a weekend, I would like to do some site seeing on Sat and Sunday 
 (my flight to Korea leaves on Sunday late afternoon).  I would appreciate 
 some suggestions and I will need a guide, could you have someone arrange it 
 for me?
 
 Thanks, and Cathy will co-ordinate everything.
 
 Mike
