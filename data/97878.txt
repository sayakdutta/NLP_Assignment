 Richard,
 As I mentioned in my phone mail message to you, we are compiling info on the 
 above-referenced entities in connection with a due diligence request by a 
 potential purchaser. The prospective purchaser has requested information on 
 the entities' litigation, whether complete, existing or pending including any 
 eminent domain proceedings and insurance litigation. Could you let me know as 
 soon as possible if you can provide me that information. The goal is to have 
 all requested information in the data room early next week . 
 
 Thank you,
 Sandi
