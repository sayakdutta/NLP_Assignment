 	Thanks for the message regarding a possible intern for your group.  Right now, we are in the process of evaluating both our new hire needs and our summer needs and will be making those decisions after the first of the year.  Until we have come up with those numbers it would be premature to make any offers for the summer.  What I would like to do in this case is get the information to Jeff Davis, who is responsible for Georgia Tech and ask him to get Sungjoo's resume and start a file on him with a notation that you would like to hire him for summer. 
 
 	When we start the summer process, we will interview the candidate and slot him for your group.
 
 	Is this okay with you?
 
 	Hope all is well  with you 
 
 	Take Care
 	Traci 
 
 
 		 
 		 		 		 		 
 		Traci,
 
 		I have visited Georgia Tech on Thursday.
 		One of the students indicated that he is
 		interested in a summer internship.
 		He came across as a very bright person,
 		very personable.
 
 		I can take him as a summer intern.

 		Dear Dr. Vincent Kaminski,
 
 		Hi. How are you doing? I hope you have a good flight back to home.
 		It was a good opportunity to know about Enron and its finance sector.
 		Thank you for your time.
 
 		I have already submitted my resume and cover letter right after the talk.
 		However, you ask me to send a copy of resume and cover letter again. Those
 		attachments are what I was asked. Again, it was a good chance for me to
 		get to know what I can do in this field and what I have to more focus on
 		in school.
 
 		I am looking forward to hearing from you soon and have a nice day.
 		Thank you.
