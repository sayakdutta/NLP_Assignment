This is actually GE Capital's form of lease agreement, but would be executed between Hanover and Enron Compression Services Company.  Please review and provide any comments you may have.
  
     
 
 	Gerald,
 	
 	Dave Gutierrez with Hanover has provided the following template agreements.
 	Apparently Hanover's methodology for this Operating Lease takes the investment
 	of equipment, packaging and installation to GE Capital for the resulting Operating
 	Lease structure.

 Mark,
 
 Per Dave Gutierrez's request, I am forwarding to you our Master Lease
 Agreement and documents for a synthetic lease structure as an operating
 lease.
 Please let me or Dave know if you have questions or comments about any of
 these documents below.
 Best Regards,
 John Stam
