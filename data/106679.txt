 Sara:  I probably have them somewhere but if you could forward to me the 
 latest guidelines, I will look at them and we can discuss.  All I remember 
 looking at was a marked up copy that you had while we were in Sao Paulo.

 Lynn:  Weren't you going to take a look at the Trader Guidelines for 
 Argentina?  Let me know if you have any questions or if I can help you 
 further.  Thanks.  SS
