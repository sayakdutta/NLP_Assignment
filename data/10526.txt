 Since we do so much business with ENA I thought I would send out this reminder:
 
 1.  NNG and ENA are entirely separate entities and our businesses are run entirely separate from one another.
 
 2.  Customers may think that they can net ENA invoices against NNG invoices.  NNG is a separate business and is not responsible for ENA invoices to their customers.
 
 3.  Should suppliers cut volumes for ENA; NNG will cut the market accordingly.
 
 4.  Creditworthiness status for ENA remains the responsibility of the Commercial Department. We are to maintain our normal course of business until instructed otherwise.
 
 
 If you receive any calls regarding dealings with ENA from our customers, please pass them on to me or keep me informed if you should handle these calls.
 
 Thanks,
 Jean
