 I received a call form Bob Bradly who is representing Vern E Falkner, and he needs to talk to someone about possibly doing a tie-in to our pipeline in Hansford County Texas. His phone number is 405-842-4334.
 I attempted to contact both of you via phone and was unsuccessful, hence the e-mail. Did not wish for this to fall through the cracks.  Thanks, John Toews, OCC
