 
 The attached is a letter agreement reflecting the resolution of certain 
 issues with Westinhouse relating to the Gleason and Wheatland projects.  It 
 also reflects that Enron isn't going to go after SWPC for a return of an 
 option payment for the Blue Girl equipment.  SWPC has requested that 
 everybody sign on the dotted line, including NEPCO, EEPC and my dog Jack.  
 Please review and advise if there is any problem with you obtaining signature 
 for your respective groups.
 
 I'll handle the LJM and ENA signatures.
 
 Please call if you have any questions.
