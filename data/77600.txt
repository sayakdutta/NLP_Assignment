 
 Hi Rob,
 
 I think we would prefer if you would route the document back this way, and 
 Sheila or I will send it to the folks at GE.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay

 All - Attached is a rewrite of Articles 20 (Indemnity) and 27 (Limitation of 
 Liability) of the draft agreement which includes our collective thoughts.  
 
 Rob - I understand that you "volunteered" to pull together our changes to the 
 draft agreement and to then forward on to GE.  
 
 If you have any questions, please give me a call.  Thanks.
 
 Scott
