 Saturday).  It was not pretty and Jeanne did a great job of remaining calm 
 and exceedlingly professional---and what a camera presence!  Unfortunately, I 
 wasn't thoughtful enough to send flowers, but a large bouquet is certainly in 
 order.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Jean received a lovely bouquet of flower Friday.  She thinks it came from one 
 of us, but I think it must have come from her boyfriend.  Were any of us 
 being very thoughtful on Friday?
