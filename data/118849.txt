 The CFTC issued a Regulatory Framework for some new regulations in late 
 February, a copy of which is attached.  No proposed regulations have resulted 
 but could come out at any time now.  There is also some activity on the Hill 
 (bills percolating through various committees: House Banking, House 
 Agriculture and Senate Agriculture) which are also of interest.  We have been 
 monitoring these developments and I'd be happy to talk them over with you.  
 Please give me a call if you'd like at x37459.

 Do you have anything you can forward to Robbi (she is one of the lawyers 
 working on bandwidth trading issues now for EBS) about new developments with 
 the CFTC?

 Alan,
 
   I understand that there are new CFTC regulations scheduled for release that 
 may impact our trading world. Do you have any info about these proposed 
 changes?
