 Mark - yesterday, I gave an update/projection presentation to Delainey, 
 Donahue and Bowen and as you know part of it included the status of the 
 various HR related issues (harassment, dismissals, etc...).  Hopefully, 
 you're aware that Michelle Cash, Dan Lyons and Butch Hayes (Fulbright & 
 Jaworski) have been guiding me all along and are fully up to speed.  However, 
 Delainey wants me to get with you to make sure you're 100% in the loop as 
 well.  
 
 Let me (or Beth) know what's convenient for you and I'll flex my calendar as 
 much as possible.
 
 Thanks, RANDY
