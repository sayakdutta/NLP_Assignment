 In response to your request about any Firm contracts on the 8" line between Atoka # 3 & #1.  There are 3 contracts using the 12" and 8" common lines, one is a Socal contract # 8255 at Rio Pecos for 6000 mmcf and an Agave contract # 26490 for 800 mmcf.  The third is an Agave contract # 27377 for March 2002 only.  I would suggest changing the contract primary points to something other than Rio Pecos.  The Socal volumes have been delivered, for sometime,  at the Discharge of Atoka #1.  The Aid State POI has been where this Socal gas has flowed.
