 
 Luis,
 
 I haven't heard when the season is supposed to start, but it should be in 
 early April.  So, I will try to schedule a practice.
 
 Let me know when you are back.

 Eric,
 
 I am finally coming home this weekend (from India).  Doesn't flag football 
 start soon??  If so, shouldn't we get a practice together at some point next 
 week??
 
 Tim,
 
 I can only imagine your excitement w/ LSU and the fact that for one day and 
 until your team is eliminated, you are the superior school.  I havent seen 
 one minute of one game so your picture was what I had in my mind from what my 
 friends told me.  I also know that my tournament brackets are fucked up and 
 absurdly low.
