 Dear all,
 
 As we know, some of the persons on the distribution list of Polish weekly 
 updates still receive the updates, although they have changed their positions 
 and/or responsibilties. As we would not like to bother you with our e-mails 
 with the reports that you do not need, please confirm that you wish to 
 continue receiving the reports on Enron's activities in Poland. 
 
 The common address ECT London European Trading will be deleted from the list 
 as a whole. Only the persons who send the confirmation will be added to the 
 list.
 
 Thank you.
 
 
 With best regards,
 
 Jarek Ferenc
