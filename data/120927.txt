I am assuming that you have now left the boat and are wondering your way to Austrailia.  Hope you are enjoying yourself.  I just spent the weekend in Memphis - visiting family and friends.  It was a lot of fun!
 
 If the show runs again and I am able to see it, perhaps I will record it for you!  Have fun and keep in touch!
