 year so I don't know how they check everyone at the door.  
 
 I know what you meant in your earlier email.  That was kind of strange.  
 Hopefully I'll get out of here at a decent time.  And if I can get my 
 accomplishments done during the day today that would be fabulous.  Maybe I 
 could even come watch you play soccer.   But all that hinges on my 
 accomplishments.  And of course since I put it off until today, we violated 
 every limit we have this morning!  Well we didn't violate p&l, just VAR and 
 positions.  So I'm sure I'll spend most of the day answering questions.
 
 See you at lunch.

 I have a question. Do you think it is possible to RSVP for the X-mas Party - 
 you and your invitee- then your invitee shows up without you? Do you think 
 they'll let him/her get in?
 
 I'll explain what I am trying to do at lunch or Brown Bag.
