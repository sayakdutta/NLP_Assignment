 
 I was just talking schmack.  
 
 
     
 
 Not a big deal to me.  I dont even know the guy or his dad.  I just
 thought you guys may be hiring.
 
 thx
 
 
     
 
 I will forward this to HR.  By the way, no one gets an MBA to be an
 energy broker.  Tell him to focus on trading.  I might be too busy to
 meet with him next week.  Have him go by and spend the day with Knauth.

 Mike and Joe,
 
 Is Enron or Reliant looking for any traders?  Mike Cook used to be a
 semi-pro hockey player.  I am sure he can handle his own on the trading
 floor (ie - kick your ass).
 
 He is going to be in town next week.  Are either of you up to letting
 him come by and introduce himself?
 
 Thanks,
 Curtis
 
 
 
     
 
 Dear Curtis, 
 
 Your father, who is a friend of my father John from Princeton, was kind
 enough 
 to give me your email address.  I am in my second year of business
 school at 
 the A.B. Freeman School at Tulane in New Orleans and I graduate in May.
 My 
 concentration is in finance and my goal is to obtain a position in the
 Energy 
 industry, either as a trader or broker.  
 
 As you must know, this is perhaps the worst time in recent history to be
 
 looking for a job.  Your father gave me your name as a long shot.  He
 figured 
 that since you live in Houston, you may know someone who might be able
 to help 
 me out.  I greatly appreciate any thoughts, advice or insights you may
 be able 
 to give me on the job market and any opportunities in Houston.  
 
 I have attached my resume in case you do know someone who is looking to
 hire.  
 If you have any questions for me, my phone number is (504) 289-9783.  I
 will be 
 in Houston next Thursday through Sunday for a Alumni networking event
 for our 
 school.  I would like to meet you in person and talk about Houston over
 a 
 beer.  Thank you for your time and I look forward to talking to you.
 
 Sincerely, 
 
 Mike Cook
