 hey,
 
 i don't have your phone number at work.  i have some bad news - i'll be flying out 3 days 
 later than i told you before.  either my booking got screwed up or i never booked the flight!
 i think it got lost on the internet some where, but i can't even remember what airline it was
 on, so it's impossible for me to check!  just booked a one week flight and i'll be coming 
 out on the 19th.  i'm still going to take the days off from work and relax in calgary a little,
 which is good.  
 
 by the way, if you haven't already gotten me something, i thought of a xmas present.  
 a squash raquet.  lots of people play here and i'm looking to get into it.   
 
 number here is 403 974 6946 if you want to chat.  
 
 love,
 coop
