 Dear Ross:
 
 Thanks.  I believe that's a good idea.  If he is unable to find a job within Enron via redeployment, this may be an opportunity for him.

 Sharon,
 
 Tobias is not associated with any of the team with whom we have scheduled a meeting.  However, I would be happy to add his team to the list of parties with which I discuss a potential sales transaction.

 Dear Ross:
 
 Thanks for the information.   It does not appear that there would be a conflict of interest if Mr. Munk puts together a team for the propose of discussing the transaction and ultimately purchasing DealBench.com.
 
 Is he associated with any of the teams with whom you are meeting to discuss the transaction?
 
 Thanks.

 Enron Net Works is currently exploring alternatives as it relates to DealBench.com, which would include selling the platform to an independent third party.  I work for Brad Richter and have been asked to lead/manage the sales effort.
 
 We have already begun to initiate discussions with third parties as it relates to the sale of DealBench.  A team from FreeMarkets, Inc. will meet with us next Tuesday to discuss such a transaction, and we are currently setting up a similar meeting with PurchasePro Com Inc.  We have also targeted several other companies that may be interested in buying DealBench and will be discussing the opportunity with them in the near future.
 
 Please let me know if you need any additional information or clarification as it relates to your questions below.

 Dear Brad and Michelle:
 
 I have reviewed the letter from Tobias Munk.
 
 Has Enron determined that it will no longer be involved with DealBench.com and given permission to allow Mr. Munk to independently raise funds for a proposed management buy-out or sale to an independent third party?  or Has Enron determined that it will not go forward with DealBench.com at this time, but it is possible in the future that it will still be involved with DealBench.com?  I note that Mr. Munk states that Enron is actively seeking a buyer for the platform.  What discussions have taken place with respect to a transaction for the purchase of DealBench.com.   
 
 Regardless of Mr. Munk's intentions, as stated in his letter of August 7, 2001, Enron must make a determination to allow Mr. Munk to use Enron's idea, etc. for DealBench.com as it is proprietary and belongs to Enron and not Mr. Munk.  If Enron has made the decision to sell DealBench.com and Mr. Munk, now no longer an Enron employee, is able to put together a group to purchase this Internet platform, I don't believe that this would constitute a violation of the Conflict of Interests Policy as described in Enron's Code of Ethics. 
 
 It appears that Mr. Munk is requesting permission from Enron to move forward with respect to DealBench.com as described in his letter. 
 
 Please confirm Enron's intentions with respect to DealBench.   In addition, please advise of any communications/discussions with Mr. Munk regarding DealBench.com and his ability to be a part of DealBench.com in the event he finds a buyer or becomes part of a group which purchases DealBench.com.
 
 Thanks.
