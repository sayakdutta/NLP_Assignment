 
 Outside of moving the deals to another book, I don't think you can avoid 
 liquidating at the end of the month.  So I'm going to leave these in the 
 portfolio.
 
 Thanks for the info.

 Robin, the book for Todd Richardson is technically dead.  We are the deals 
 that are in there monthly.  Is there a better way to do this?  We hate having 
 to remember to liquidate it at the end of the month.  I think it deals in 
 there until Aug 2001.

 Please review the attached file.  The books listed for each trader are marked 
 for removal from the portfolio.  If you are currently using one of these 
 books or will be using it in the future please highlight the book id in 
 YELLOW.  If the book is no longer used please highlight the book id in BLUE.  
 When you have finished please return the file to me.
 
 
 
 Thanks for your help,
