 Dear All,
 
 please find attached hereto the draft of the stock option agreement
 according to our call held last Thursday and the subsequent electronic
 messages. Modification includes (i) item 1 - ref. to the Committee and
 Black-Scholes valuation; (ii) item 4 - ref. to the former vesting scheduled;
 (iii) item 6 - expanded non-compete clause; (iv) item 7 - expanded
 confidentiality clause; and (v) new item 8 - non-soliciting
 (customers/employees) clause (please confirm/decide the terms for those
 obligations). Having everything decided, please let me know so as to change
 the Portuguese version.
 
 Should you need any clarification, please write or call.
 
 Kind Regards,
