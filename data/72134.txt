 
 Hi Ed,
 
 I can't find (or recall) that I received the subsequent email referenced in 
 this email.  Can you direct me to the right place?  I looked under 
 Administrator and Legal Net X, and all my emails from 3/8. 
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay

 Ladies and Gentlemen:
 
 This afternoon you will receive a Logon ID and Password to a secure website 
 known as LegalNetEx ("LNX").   LNX will provide the Enron/GE Turbine Contract 
 
 Team with a centralized location for the efficient and organized exchange of 
 contract drafts and revision proposals.  It works like this:
 
 1.  When you log on to LNX, a set of instructions will lead you to the most 
 recent version of the contract.   To review and revise the contract you will 
 
 download the document onto your PC or LAN.     
 
 2. Consistent with normal drafting, you will need to save your revised 
 version of the contract on your system, under a new name.  
 
 3. When you are ready to provide your revised version of the contract to the 
 rest of the team, you will upload the your document onto LNX.  Peter Thompson 
 will 
 receive an automatic email from LNX each time a team member uploads a revised 
 document.  
 
 4.  When Peter  has incorporated the various revisions proposed by the team, 
 he will upload the resulting revision cycle on LNX.    Each team member will 
 
 receive an automatic email notification when Peter uploads the latest and 
 greatest version of the contract. 
    
 
 Additionally, you will not have to redline your document for the group, LNX 
 will handle redlining for us, it's automatic, too.
 
 
 If you have questions or difficulties with LNX, please contact Matt 

 
 For nontechnical questions or comments, please feel free to contact me, Ed 

 
 Thank you,
 Ed
