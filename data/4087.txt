 What did I tell you??  That's good though- I'll get to see you.  I need to go 
 to the grocery- but I left my list at home.  Guess I'll go tomorrow.  And 
 I'll cook Thursday and Saturday night.  How does that sound?

  I hate to say this, but maybe its best if we reschedule.  it doesnt sound 
 like we are all going to be able to make it by 6 and i would rather not be 
 rushed considering we see each other once every 6 months.
 
 let me know what you girls think.  maybe we should try a weekend lunch?
