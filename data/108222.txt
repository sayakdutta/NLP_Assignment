 ok...so I do want the low-down on last night b/c I am sure there is a lot 
 that is inappropriate for email!  I will be out of the office all afternoon 
 so if you want to talk I'll be on my cell phone 256-5582.
 Big....small....it is still the Enron Executive Committee and you should feel 
 extremely proud.  I am so happy for you!
 I hope that you have a great lunch and that your speech went will this 
 morning.

 Great!  Sorry YOU weren't there...
 I'm on my way out  for a lunch.  I'll call you later.   (I'm excited about 
 the exec committee, but it is a little big, so I told Skilling we should 
 rename it the exec villiage!)
