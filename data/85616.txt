 Gerald,
 
 There is a meeting scheduled for Tuesday, Sept 25 at 9 am to discuss, among other things, the hazardous waste issues at Assumption Parish with Kyle Purvis and David Owen.  Would you be able to make to the meeting for about 10-15 minutes to discuss this issue? 
 
 Any changes on the chain of title issue for the Assumption Parish deal?
