 
 I'm not sure whether we want Hoecker to make the fourth point.  What do 
 others think?
 
 



   
 We thought it would be good to basically give Chair Hoecker talking points 
 with any numbers that Enron provides.  We will visit on these later today 
 when the numbers are ready (before 3:00).  Comments?

 Here is my stab at the talking points  to be sent in to FERC along with the 
 gas pricing info they requested for the California markets.  Let me or 
 Christi know if you have any disagreements, additions, whatever.  I am 
 supposed to be out of here at 2:15 today, so if you have stuff to add after 
 that, get it to Christi.  Thanks.
