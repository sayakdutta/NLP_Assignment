 
 Because I'm not quite sure who to direct this request to, I'm e-mailing 
 everyone I think might be involved in entering new counterparty names. One of 
 our mid-marketers has executed a deal with Sierra Pacific Holding Company, 
 which is a new counterparty name and needs to be added as a choice in 
 Enpower. Please let me know if I've contacted the correct people, and if I've 
 contacted the incorrect people. (Sorry!)
 
 Thanks,
 Kate Symes
