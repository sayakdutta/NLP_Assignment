 Jim and Sara:
 
 Jim, I received your voice mail and apologize for taking so long to get back
 to you.  I attach a copy of the last draft we discussed that contains the
 new jurisdiction language.  I used some of your suggested language, ISDA's
 section 13 wording and then just lifted the rest from the language in the
 indemnity to the engagement letter that I faxed to you earlier today.
 Please let me know if this is acceptable.
 
 Thanks,
