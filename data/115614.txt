 deals to reflect APB's price 
 554905 is $350
 554912 is $325

 I'm trying to get ahold of Jeff Richter on this, but without the brokers 
 around we probably can't get it done tonight. I would just say we have a 
 discrepancy with the broker at this point. Let me know if that's okay.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate
