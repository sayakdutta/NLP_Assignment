 Good Morning..........sir,
 
 I am wearing my sweatshirt and my new boots to work, so my feet are warm and I feel like I have you wrapped around me. My roses are starting to really open up now, they are so beautiful.
 
 I had fun at the party last night, danced my fool head off.  Good natured fun dancing with the buds from work.  One guy tried to dip me and failed miserably, I fell on my right hip, but not before I nearly knocked myself unconcious on part of the wall. I ended up sitting there for a minute with a packet of frozen soybeans on my noggin.  I told him no more of that stuff. On the way home from the party I almost just showed up at your house, but figured you needed a break from me for some rest.  
 
 You have a good day, hope you are rested and feeling good.
 
 :)
