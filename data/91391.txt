    Hi Jai,
 
    I'm in the middle of one of the most incredibly busy weeks I've ever
    had.
    But I couldn't possibly forget the guy who wore one of the most unique
    and
    enticing shirts I've ever seen...(we met last Saturday)
 
    Thought you might like to meet for lunch next week....
 
    Jenny
