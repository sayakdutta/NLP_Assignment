 Chris,
 
 the pipeline maps I found are worth looking at. They don't cost much ($950 for paper version and $795 for CD rom version) for both US and Canada. I think that CD-ROM version is a better bet: you can zoom in and out and you can print the parts you need. The real value is that they show every interconnect with every facility (power plants, industrials, even prisons:).
 
 I think that it is something that would help us look into details when we approach different regions, and I think basis traders would appreciate it too.
 
 Sample map of Montana is attached.
