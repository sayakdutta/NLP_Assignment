 Was Lorraine able to get you an answer before she left?  I know she had a few calls into Nevada Power.  Let me know if you need me to do anything on this in her absence.

 Can you please find out who the person(s) in charge of fuel procurement for Nevada Power currently is? Name, phone number and title would help (either someone at the director or VP level). Thanks.  
 
  
     
 The last time I spoke with anyone at NP was about 2 yrs. ago.  John Olenick was against any more FT because of the impending dereg.  To my knowledge, no one at Las Vegas Cogen has been approached directly.
 
  
     
 Who at Nevada Power are we talking to about capacity? Las Vegas Cogen?

 Steve - In response to your previous questions regarding customers behind SWG.  SWG's largest customers are power plants.
 
 	Nevada Power (still owns generation)
 	El Dorado (Reliant and Sempra)
 	Nevada Cogen Assoc. (NCA1 & 2) (partially owned by Texaco)
 	Saguro Power Plant (NRG partially owns)
 	Las Vegas Cogen (Enron involved?)
 	
 Parties who are either planning to build new power plants or are already building power plants in the Southern Nevada area include
 Mirant
 Reliant
 Calpine
 PG&E
 
 APS/Pinnacle West was among the buyers of one of Nevada Power's plants before dereg in NV was postponed.
 
 Please let me know if you need other info.
