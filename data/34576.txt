 that someone in Global?

 The contract for Hunt Petroleum has been assigned from CES to Enron.  I need 
 someone to change the names on deals 136863, 135898 and 136845 from CES-Hunt 
 Petroleum to Hunt Petroleum (without CES).  All of the deals are on the East 
 desk.  Let me know if this request is to go to one of you or if I need to 
 forward this to someone else.
 
 Thanks,
 Megan
