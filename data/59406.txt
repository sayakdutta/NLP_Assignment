 Bob,
 
 Here are all active in-the-money trades in our books as of last night.
 The summary tab gives you the deal count and MTM value by month, the next tab breaks the value down by counterparty if needed.
 I already sent this to Kristen. 
 
 
  
 Here are the performance deals as well, James may have already sent this to you...
 
  
 Let me know if there is anything I left out.
 
 Thanks
 
 KK
