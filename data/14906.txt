They have been bugging us to visit and I don't see another date on the calendar that will work.  Nov 3 for example, there is no children's church, but I am open/close trustee.  Don't worry about the CD player -- it's no problem.  I don't mind exchanging it until we get a CD player and duplicate copies of music (which I'm working on).
  
 We received our INS approval to adopt Alina, but with court date delays etc., it looks like our most likely travel time is late November or early December.  When I get a little better info.  I will make Children's Church plans.  If it turns out that I'm gone several weeks in December, then perhaps we can talk Patty into letting the kids sit in regular church during Advent.  It is always such a fun time for them to be in church & they recognize so many of the songs.  If I'm only going to be gone in late Dec & first week of Dec, then we can probably continue with Children's church as planned.  I'm really just guessing now -- since this international adoption stuff changes by the minute.
  
  
  
 
 
     
 
 Of course, that will be OK.  I'll need to find another helper so we have 3.  Will Kim be there?  If not, maybe I can enlist my husband. 
 Will you be at 8:30 service?  If so I can get the CD from you then.  I really need to buy a CD player - maybe I can do that by Saturday so we don't have to pass yours back and forth.  I'll let you know if I'm successful. 
 Thanks for the attendance numbers - I'll call Jackie tomorrow.
