 of love germs is almost too much to handle. Hey, if you get this in the next 
 half an hour, write back with your phone number and I'll call you when I get 
 off work. (I'm leaving at 5 p.m. ON THE DOT today....whooo, hooo!) But this 
 newfound life perfection sounds like it deserves a phone conversation.

 Hey lady!
 
 What's up?  I just had the most hectic week of my life!  I had such a great
 time with Dad and Laura - is it just me or does he get cooler every time you
 see him?  He took me, Nathan, Michelle and Monica out to this awesome
 restaurant and totally paid for everyone.  I was so touched, especially
 since I think they're kind of trying to watch the funds.  My car is great!
 It's so little and perfect.  Then as soon as they left I went on my Outward
 Bound weekend, which was incredible.  We went snowshoeing, did a ropes
 course, and learned how to use a map and compass (the last thing was SO fun
 - I want to buy a compass and carry it around with me everyday).  Anyway,
 I'll have to tell you more about it on the phone since it was kind of
 complicated, but super fun.  I had SUCH a great time, and I'm even more
 convinced that this is the right job for me right now.  Nathan is still good
 - I'm installing a toothbrush at his apartment, which I think is a good
 sign.  He's great.
 
 So what's going on in your life?  Call me tonight if you get a chance!
 
 Love, yo sista
