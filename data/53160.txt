 I hope you are doing well.
 The UBS Energy business will definitely miss you and
 your weather group! I have to say everyone is quite
 concerned how will we be getting the weather forecast
 :).
 
 As for me, I have accepted the UBS offer and will be
 back in the Gas Fundamentals group for now.
 
 This is my personal e-mail address, I hope we can stay
 in touch,
 
 Best regards,
 Biliana Pehlivanova
