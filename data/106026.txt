 We're glad to hear that you are coming and we're looking forward to seeing
 you again.
 
 You can fly into any one of the three Washington area airports.  Reagan
 National is the closest (about 35 minutes by car in non-rush hour traffic),
 Washington Dulles is about 40 minutes away and BWI is about 50 minutes away.
 That is generally our order of preference in looking for flights.  However,
 flights into BWI in general may be cheaper than flights into Dulles or
 National, and National tends to be the most expensive.  You need to check all
 three as to price, because airfares change frequently and sometimes USAir or
 another airline will quote a decent price into National.  Once you have
 decided which airport you will be using, let us know and we will e-mail
 directions.
 
 Love - Anita and Steve
