   Can you think of any other means to find out if this deal that we have in the system is good?

 Dear Settlements Coordinators,
 
   I'd like to ask a favor...
   Could you guys please check your counterparties to see if anyone has a dispute on 3-14-01 regarding a purchase or sale of 40 MW at HE 3? 
     
 
    Sincere thanks,
