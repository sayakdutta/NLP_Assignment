 Yes - told the rug guy to make it around 6:45p- I have a call that might keep me at work until 6pm
 FYI- talked to our insurance (health) about all the claims we have been paying in full for services
 and they will reimburse us 50% of reasonable and customary charges even though he is out of network
 so that is good news- I have just mailed them my last visits- please keep your receipts thanks
 
 
     
 thnx , talk to the furniture people and they will call back , they thought tonight between 5:30 and 7
 that fits in with the rug right ?
