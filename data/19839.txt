 Thanks very much for the note.  For the moment, we do still intend to go ahead with the projects and will stay in very close contact with you should the situation change.  If you have any questions, please let me know.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Jeff and Stan:
 
 I lead the group responsible for assuring safe, reliable and timely
 generation electric interconnections with PG&E's D and T systems. I work
 closely with Rod Boschee's group that handles gas gen interconnections.
 
 I just wanted to check in with Enron to see if the company was still
 planning to go ahead with the Los Banos project and the Lodi project. It's
 important we know Enron's plans to assure we conduct the most accurate
 transmission planning studies possible given the number of projects in the
 application process, notably at Los Banos. While we have sufficient funds to
 continue the pending electric study at present, we are unsure of Enron's
 desires. 
 
 As for gas interconnection issues, given the discussions about the Lodi
 project extension, it would be useful to know Enron's intent with that
 project also.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Paul Sivley
 Manager, Generation Interconnection Services
