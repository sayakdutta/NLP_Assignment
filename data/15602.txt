 Hi Steven,
 
  Attached is the first of four documents that we have prepared for
 the focus groups.  All of the exercises are works in progress and I am
 sending them to you for comments. (Hopefully, we are on the right track.)
 As we discussed, I am happy to fly down to Houston tomorrow so that we can
 review these materials together.  If, however, you feel that we can edit the
 exercises via email that's fine too. Just let me know which arrangement
 makes you the most sense to you. Hope all is well.
 
 Regards,
 
 Liz
