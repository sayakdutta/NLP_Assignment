 
 I forgot about Grandma.  I bet you love the temperature today (BRRRR).
 
 Hamburgers sound good to me.  
 
 I think MAM does ok in the morning, he just needs his hours of sleep.  Paige 
 was worse to get up.
 
 
 
 


   
  
 I had to drag him out of bed this morning. He is not a morning person like
 his mom. I think he is more like his sister in that regard. We made it on
 time and he even finished breakfast.
 Remember I will be taking grandma to the doctor today. If the weather holds
 maybe I will grill burgers tonight and get Michael can get to bed early.
 Love, Neil

 Michael, the game, etc.
