 may want some outside help.  If we are building a plant and selling power, 
 there are lots of folks at Enron who weigh in on it.

 Would I the one to handle a PPA term sheet with a potential offtake party for 
 a Wisconsin-based peaker facility that someone in Ben's group, Ron Tapscott,

 Doug,
 
 see attached term sheet for NMC (Arpin, WI site).  Please provide comments 
 and changes as appropriate (plus add language for your insurance product in 
 the place holder).
 
 Carlos,
 
 Doug and I will provide you background.  I am not sure if you are the 
 appropriate Legal Support (please direct us to the appropriate person if you 
 are not).
 
 This is a starting point and is fairly general (to facilitate discussions 
 with NMC).
 
 Thanks, Ron.
