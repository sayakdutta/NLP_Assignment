 Gentlemen:  I work with Bill Abington, Partner in our Financial Advisory
 Services Group at PricewaterhouseCoopers - Houston.  Bill met with you on
 Wednesday and asked that I add your names to our mailing lists for the
 various activities hosted by our group during the year.  In order to make
 sure that I put you on mailing lists for the events that you would find
 most interesting, would you please advise me if you play golf or shoot
 sporting clays?  We have our annual Sporting Clays event coming up on
 October 19th at American Shooting Center.  If you are interested in either
 golf or clays, would you please let me know?  Thank you.
