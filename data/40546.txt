 Thanks for the "heads-up", Julie!   Stan would like for both Danny and Rod to 
 send subs to our staff meeting on January 8th, and please let me know who 
 they will be.
 
 Thanks,
 Cindy

 Cindy:
 
 Please note that I just received information from Cindy Olson on the Year-End 
 2000 VP and MD PRC meeting.  It is scheduled for Monday, January 8th and 
 Danny is required to attend as he serves on that committee.  Danny would not 
 be able to attend Stan's staff meeting.  Thanks.
