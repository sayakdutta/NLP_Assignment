 ES--Can one of the attorneys comment to Joe this week on any legal issues in 
 these proposed NERC documents?  Thanks.

 Jim -- EPSA already acts as our agent on generic NERC matters, especially the 
 Market Interface Committee.  EPSA will not get involved in the NERC regions 
 such as WSPP, since these are local matters.  If we do not have the resources 
 to be effective in the WSCC region, we should discuss pulling out with Tim.  
 
 Christi -- Please forward these documents to Jeff Hodge or Elizabeth Sager 
 and ask for their help.
 I will need to vote on them early next week at the WSCC Board of Directors 
 meeting.  Thanks  JOE

 Joe --
 
 Not sure if we ever decided anything on this?  Have we ever thought about 
 having EPSA act as our "agent" for NERC matters and working through that body 
 to cover legal / policy change reviews?
 
 I don't know if we have the $$ to review these documents.
 
 Jim

 Attached is a summation of the WSCC Executive Policy Issues Task Force 
 meeting held in San Francisco on November 2,  In addition there are several 
 attachnebts that will be voted on at the Board meeting in December including 
 the By Laws for the formation of the WIO.  It is anticipated that the WIO 
 will be ready for a FERC filing during the 1s half of 2001  There is a large 
 amt of material and some of it needs review by legal in my opinion.   Note 
 that we voted  "no" on the EHV ballot  because it restricts access to 
 information.  The bylaws and the detail documents are most critical for legal 
 review.  For clarity read them in the following order:  EPITF Nov 2;  
 wiosummary; bylaws;detail doc.  If there aqre questions you can call me at
