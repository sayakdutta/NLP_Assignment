 
 Hey, guys:  I'm negotiating a rush ISDA for ECTRIC under the law of England 
 and Wales.  I believe that Michael drafted originally.
 
 (1)  submission to English courts and waiver of all objections
 
 (2)  setoff  for all events (excluding affiliates) except for Tax Event or 
 Tax Event Upon Merger
 
 Are the foregoing acceptable for ECTRIC?
 
 Your immediate response is appreciated as Michael Moulton wants to book deal 
 Tuesday,  Nov. 7.
 
 
 Thanks.  Sara
