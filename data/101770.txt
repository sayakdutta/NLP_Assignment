 that's fine...i can meet you by the elevators for the parking garage
 
  
     
 how about 4:30 Janie is out at 4:00
 
  
     
 you tell me...you're the one that is actually working these days.
 
 Would you mind mentioning it to Janie as well...I'd hate to not offer?
 
  
     
 I would love a ride. What time
 
  
     
 Was wondering if you'd like a ride home this evening.  Also, if Janie would like one she's more than welcome to join.
