 
 Just got a call from a fellow named Jame Edgerly at the Enterprise Zone, 
 Inc.  He told me that Ken Lay (through Ken's secretary Vanessa) referred me 
 to him.  He is very interested in getting us to help him work with the 
 Legislature to establish an "Enterprise Zone" energy tariff to encourage 
 investment in California's Enterprice Zones.  Before I launch on the effort, 
 just wanted to check in and see if this rings a bell with you.  Thanks.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
