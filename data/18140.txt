 
 It was only a draft.  The commission has to vote it out for it to become 
 effective.  They've delayed doing that.  Therefore it's status quo on the 
 SoCalGas system.

 Jeff - I read this in Com. Bilas' draft final opinion. Are you saying that 
 the draft final opinion was never truly final? 
 
 I am looking for the windowing process and how intrastate capacity is 
 allocated. Any suggestions?
 
  
     
 The interim settlement never got voted out.  Therefore it ain't official, so 
 there's no requirement yet to refile anything.  (Welcome to California.)  In 
 fact, folks are still trying to get the Commission to reject the IS and 
 approve the one that we worked on (though the chances of that are not huge, 
 at this point).  Give a holler if there's anything else.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 In Commissioner Bilas' draft Final Opinion of the IS (page 51), Socal was 
 ordered to withdraw advice letter 2837 a file a new advise letter to 
 implement a revised physical receipt point allocation system.  Was that ever 
 filed and, if so, can you please send a copy?
 
 Regards,
 
 Stephanie
