 In response to an anticipated low participation rate in the Nov. 15 Vision 
 and Values meeting, we are rescheduling the Vision and Values meeting to 
 Tuesday, Nov. 14, from 2-3:30 in eb8c1.
 
 Please plan to attend this rescheduled meeting.  Please let me know if you 
 are unavailable for the meeting.
 
 Thanks!
