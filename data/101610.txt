 
 i think i'd make an excellent ski bunny...
 
 fun, likes the outdoors/being active, loves the water (i.e. hot tubs) and can top anyone in the "roaring fire/glass of merlot" department.
 
  
     
 how about "ski lift tech level 1"
 
  
     
 you would think...the 1st time you hear the comment....but those have been made now with careless abandon..everyday...regardless of whether i'm doing good, bad or even breathing
 
  
     
 i thought it was a compliment.
 
 you and boxing.....bad
 
 
 and the frymaster comment....hilarious
 
  
     
 like the pendulum would be anything different after one of those...i was considering a position as fry master at Mc D's
 
 
 i now completely understand suzanne's comments about condescension....i feel it non-stop.
 
 the "watch out"..."maybe i should get my resume together" comments are rubbing me the WRONG way.
 
 i need to give thomas a call...i feel a boxing urge coming on
