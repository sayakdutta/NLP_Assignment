 Hi, Mark - still waiting to hear from traders.  Sara
 
  
     
 I wanted to follow up with you regarding the draft statement I sent around
 for comment last night.  I know you are very busy, but would greatly
 appreciate it if you could send me any comments you have by noon New York
 Time.  I re-attached it for your review.
 
 Thank you in advance.
