 
 Give me a call.  I'm thinking that from your note, the CA meetings are 
 getting in your way.  I was hoping that KL could meet with Bryson on the 4th, 
 but looks like they already scheduled.  I just want to make sure that Rosie 
 doesn't get all crossed up with many of us sending her stuff.  Let's talk and 
 maybe I can get the Bryson meeting rearranged.
 
 Your pal,
 Jeff
