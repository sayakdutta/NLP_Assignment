 would do it.  I have a lot of respect for Geringer.  I may try to persuade 
 them that they should reach out to FERC and Congress as a state that sees the 
 need for a federal role in transmiission and encourages FERC to act.  Any 
 background you have would be most appreciated.
 
 
    
  
 Steve--unfortunately, I really do need you to do this one.

 I'd prefer to skip.  How big of a problem would that be?
 
 

 
  
 Steve/RIck ---as you may be aware, Governor Geringer personally asked Ken Lay 
 to come to the kick off meeting of the Wyoming Energy Task Force, a group 
 that was created by legislative mandate last month.  The meeting is on May 
 30th in Cheyenne.  Mr. Lay told the Governor that he would not be able to 
 make it on that date, but promised that a senior Enron exectutive would be 
 there.  I spoke with Governor Geringer's staff person again this past week 
 and was hoping that Paul Kaufman could be the senior executive, but no such 
 luck (unless you give Paul a huge new title!).  
 
 In talking with Maureen I understand that you have a previous conflict Steve, 
 but I am hoping that you can review your calendar to see if you could make an 
 adjustment in order to meet the request of the Governor.  Your speech would 
 be in the morning--I've been told about 9 o clock or so---which would allow 
 for you to leave by noonish.
