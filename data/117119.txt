 by phone.  Ken is available from 9 to 11 and then again from 3 or 4 onwards.  
 Which would you prefer?

 Cool and Yup to the lawyer - probably both of you if you can make it as we 
 will revisit the regulatory issues in depth for the paperwork - can we set up 
 Wed in NY?
 
 

 
  
 Louise:
 
 The S & C first draft of the Posting Agreement was fine as far as it went, 
 but it was only a first draft and needs a rework before the meeting to make 
 the best use of your time.  Mark and I plan to redraft it and recirculate it 
 in the next couple of days -- I wouldnb't recommend you look at the current 
 draft, because it doesn't really say anything other than what is already in 
 the True Quote term sheet.
 
 Do you need a lawyer with you in New York when you meet with S & C?
