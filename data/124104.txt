 Hey guys!
 
 Sorry I wasn't able to get to some of you and tell you what we got him.  
 We gave him an XL Jansport Backpack.  Believe it or not this is something 
 that he has wanted.  He seemed to really like it.

 Thanks to all you for the back-pack.  I needed a new one.
 
 My daughter had taken my old one.
 
 Mostly thanks for making this place a great place to work.
 
 You make my job easy.
