 1.  I take it "ECTRL" is the Master Agreement between ECTRIC and ENA.  All 
 the internal masters are kept in Houston.  I will send you a copy.
 2.  Moravske Naftove is an agreement that London Legal got in place.  We do 
 not have copies here, I suggest you contact Matt Dawson to get a copy.
 3.  Risk Mangement & Trading/ECTRIC-I will send you a copy.
 4.  State Street Bank, as Trustee/ECTRIC-this was for the Cash VI Project and 
 is not for general trading purposes.  I will send copies to you.
 5.  Elf Trading S.A./ECTRIC-London Legal should have copies.  Contact Matt 
 Dawson
