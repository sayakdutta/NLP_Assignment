 Scott,
  
 I did the last four pages of this.  The pages before that look like they have already been done.  I just spot checked most of them but the entire first page was done already.  I didn't want to waste time, Bridgette is out until next year so I couldn't ask her what the problem is.  I'll leave the pages on your desk.

 Please note that I am resending Part 6 because I had to remove deal# 309909 and 309408,  they are Enron affiliates.  Sorry for the inconvenience.

 Jeff, 
 
 Please find part 6 of the ENA deals that still need to be moved into the bankruptcy books as a result of our contracts auto-terminating.   We have been compiling a list of deals that will need further review by Legal and/or Risk and will have these to you very soon as well.  
 
 Since Stacy Richardson is on vacation, feel free to call me 3-3818.  If not, please call any of the people listed above if you should have any questions or concerns with this data.  
 
 
 Thanks, 
 Bridgette Anderson
