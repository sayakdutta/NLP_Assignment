  Here is what I have pulled based on the areas I currently have access. If 
 you are looking for Financial contracts on a commodity not listed let me know 
 & I will track down who can pull it for you. Sorry this took me so long.

 After our meeting last week I spoke to Mary about getting a list of the 
 products trading restrictions in our financial master and I haven't received 
 it.  With Mary out I don't know who to contact to get it, can you help me 
 with this?  Also, would it be possible to get a list of the global contract 
 numbers for our financial masters?  Thanks!
