 
 Matt and Denis:
 
 I spoke with Matthew Flett about an hour ago and he advised that 
 EnronCredit.com Limited had finalized its ISDA.  I requested a copy burt he 
 has not yet sent it over.  Both ENE and ENA want to execute masters with MSCS 
 and we would like to work from your document.
 
 Can you email me a copy?
 
 Thanks.  Sara
