 Jason had a few ISDAs for Cayman Islands (the Tudor group of docs) which he 
 advised were final.  Samantha prepared final docs.  I looked them over just 
 generally and signed off.  I am however asking Samantha to just check with 
 you regarding the docs before we send to credit since they are Cayman/FX and 
 I think you worked with Jason on them.  Thanks.  Mary
