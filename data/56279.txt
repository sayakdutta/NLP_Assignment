 Vince,
 I hope you are well. Sorry I have not been in touch but I have been swamped 
 trying to build my organization simultaneously as I endeavor to understand 
 EBS and navigate its political terrain. Quite interesting. I shall tell you 
 more later.
 My wife, Elisabeth and I would love to have you for dinner at our house any 
 Saturday at you convenience. Would please let me  know which Saturday would 
 be suitable? We are both looking forward to it so please let me know.
 Thanks,
 Tony
