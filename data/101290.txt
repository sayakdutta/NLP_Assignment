 
 Adriane,
 
 Thank you so much for helping me out Friday night.  Just one of those things....you think you're doing great and the next thing you know you feel like you've slammed into a brick wall at 100 mph.  I have now barred myself from any sort of contest with Bass (they always turn ugly) and have instituted a personal limit for myself.  Hopefully, I'll find the maturity that was missing during our gathering at Teala's and will be able to stick to the new limit.
 
 Thanks again,
 Susan
