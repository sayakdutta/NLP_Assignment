 
 I just forwarded this e-mail to Stan and then spoke with him about the 
 confirm on this deal. He said he's never received a letter of confirmation on 
 these Valley Electric deals - they just verbally confirm them. I've given him 
 your name, and he should be contacting you shortly to discuss how to proceed 
 on this. Please let me know how I can help.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
   
  
 In regard to this deal, could you please email me a copy of the confirmation 
 that the trader prepares.  We will need to put a copy into the our files.  We 
 will also need a copy of the executed confirmation for our files.
 
 Thanks!

 When you change this to no confirm, please put a note in the comment section 
 about why we are not domfirming it, because it falls within our guidelines to 
 confirm and at somepoint, I will be asked why we did not confirm this deal.
 
 Thanks!

 Deal should be no confirm. It was done by Stan Cocke in Services, and those 
 guys deal directly with their counterparty contacts. He thought he marked 
 this no confirm, but must have defaulted to confirm anyway. I'll change deal 
 as soon as risk is done with their calc.
