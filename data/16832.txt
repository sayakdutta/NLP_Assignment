 questions of my accountant brother-in-law.  You did a great job.  I don't 
 know how much time I'll have, but I'll see if I can throw in a bit of text 
 and raise the issues.  See you tonite.
 
 
 
 


  
 
 Hi Jeff,
 
 I guess you would make a better accountant than me.  Your analysis sounds
 right.  Feel free to make changes as fit.
 
 My apologies for missing out on these items.
