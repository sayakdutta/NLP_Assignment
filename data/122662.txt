 
 Dennis,
 
 Thank you for your kind note.  It is amazing how our pets become so much a part of our lives.  John has talked me into going to the cat show which happens to be in town this weekend.  Of course, we will pay special attention to the Turkish Angora breed.  Thanks for your thoughts.

 ...to hear about Herschel.
 
 You were really lucky to have such a fine lad in your lives for so many 
 years, but I know that doesn't help a bit right now, and I know nothing I 
 write will help a bit either.  He was a very, very cool cat [and he knew it, 
 too].  The "penthouse" fit him to a "T".
 
 Just know that I am feeling for you both.  We lost Coco about this time last 
 November and I still miss him every day.
 
 Take care.
 
 Thanx,
 Dennis

 >Americans travel smartly, safely, and affordably in a way that
 >broadens our understanding of this planet and our place in it.
