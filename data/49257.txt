 
 Gary,
 
 Any interest in this candidate? His profile
 does not exactly match my  requirements.

 Dear Vince:
 
 In following up on my voicemail message today, I attach my resume below for
 your review and consideration.
 
 It's ironic that you called while I was putting the message together.  I
 will keep it short and look forward to speaking to you at your convenience.
 
 Best regards,
 
 Paul
