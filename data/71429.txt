 
 You are not just buying a pig; you are buying a brighter future for the youth 
 of Texas.  When you purchase a pig from the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo 
 (HLS&R), Junior Swine Auction Committee, all proceeds will go into the HLS&R 
 Scholarship Fund benefiting Texas youth.  Pigs are $600 each and are 
 approximately 225 lb. gross weight.  The pigs can either be donated to The 
 Houston Food Bank or delivered to a processor for your personal use.   To 
 participate please contact Jessie Jewell at 5-4983.  Because this is a 
 tax-deductible contribution, Enron will match your donation dollar for 
 dollar.  Click here to print out the Matching Gift form.  
 
 Individuals donating $600 or more are eligible for an invitation for two to 
 the Whole Hog Cookers BBQ Tent at the Championship BBQ Cook-off held February 
 9 and 10.  Individuals donating $600 or more can also receive an invitation 
 for two to the Swine Auction Breakfast and Swine Auction on February 28.  
 Cash contributions of any amount are gladly accepted.
