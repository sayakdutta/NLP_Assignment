 Ken said that given he will be in town on March 15, he will plan to attend 
 the meeting also. By way of this e-mail, I'll check with Joe's office to see 
 what time it's scheduled.
 
 Thanks.
 
 Rosie
 
 
 
    
 
 Ken and Joe
  Jim Harmon, Chairman of EXIMBank will be in Houston March 15 and would like 
 to meet with Enron to see where there are opportunities for EXIM to work more 
 closely with the company.  He will be accompanied by Jeff Miller VP who 
 oversees the finance operations and perhaps Barabara O"Boyle, head of the 
 project finance group.  As you know we have done little with the Bank since 
 Trakya. We intended to use the Bank for Dabhol 2 but were prevented to by 
 sanctions imposed against India.  Joe is now on the EXIM Advisory Committee 
 so it would be a good opportunity to sit down with the Bank. 
  I understand that Ken has received a letter from EXIM about the meeting and 
 referred it to Joe.  I would propose that Joe lead the meeting with some of 
 the regional finance people (parallel the Munoz schedule, but shorter) with a 
 brief courtesy call on Ken or Ken could step in for a moment whenever he is 
 available.
  I will check with Pam re Joe's availability and follow up with a memo re the 
 market window initiative with EXIM where my office is heavily involved.
