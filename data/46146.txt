 
 So, back to my original question, is this a name change?

 Please contact Cheryl or Marilyn Colbert for any name change, mergers, 
 acquisition documents

 Is Calpine Energy Services, L.P. a name change from Calpine Power Services 
 Company?  If it is I need to see the name change, because I have a financial 
 master executed under Calpine Power Services.  Can you fax it to me at 
 713/636-3490.  Thanks!
