 
 Dear Dr. Whitaker,
 
 I was contacted a few days ago by my friend, Richard McMinn, who is currently holding the Swiss Re Chair in the Management of Risk,  Centre for Risk and Insurance Studies, Nottingham University Business School. Before moving to England, he was for many years with the University of  Texas at Austin. He is also an editor of The Journal of Risk and Insurance.
 
 Richard expressed interest in coming back to the States, and specifically to Texas. I remember from a number of conversations with you and other rmembers of your staff, that you are thinking about making several additions to the Faculty of Jones School, especially in the area of risk management. Richard is a well qualified candidate that you may consider in your search.
 
 I am attaching the address of Richard's CV. Please, feel free to contact me if you need more information about his academic credentials.
