 I haven't written because I haven't figured out what we learned at the 
 meeting.  We can discuss next week at our conference.  We are arranging to 
 have Michael re-tested.  I think it is more of an issue of a difference 
 between potential and performance.  Michael has been tested in the past, and 
 tests as extraordinarily bright, but he has had some performance issues which 
 don't match up.  At least that's how I understand it. He just has some 
 disconnects which we are working to overcome, but I must admit to not 
 understanding it all.
 
 I left you a note about Michael possibly missing next week.  After I dropped 
 him off this am, I had a thought that next week might be when they visit in 
 1st grade, in which case we probably wouldn't want him to miss that 
 opportunity.  I think he is excited about 1st grade, so you must be doing a 
 great job of getting the kids prepared.
 
 Thanks for everything, and see you next week!

 Kay,
 I'm interested to hear how things went at the meeting.
 Michael was the star of the show.  He did a great job!  Glad you both made
 it.
