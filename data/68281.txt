 This is an update to keep you posted on recent changes:
 
 The October start has been waved-off.  November is now the firm target.  Russell is planning to have the contract executed a week from today, Oct 5th.
 
 The Mich vs ML7 and Consumers vs ML7 basis spreads have been moved back into the main body of the summary sheet.  We are going to use those tickets.
 
 Geoff said to drop the two NYMEX fuel hedge tickets.  He is not going to put that hedge on with the NYMEX desk.
 
 The contract language hasn't evolved in a manner that supports the 2nd and 3rd winter Mich and Consumers FPPrgm.  Therefore, that volume will revert from FPPrgm to Mich index sale.
 
 The treatment of summer injection cost still has not been resolved.  If MGU agrees to bear that cost adjustments will be required to our Mich index sale ticket.
 
 There's probably more but that's all that come to mind right now.
 
 Let me know if you have any questions.
