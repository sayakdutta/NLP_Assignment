 Debbie/Tom,
 
 Attached is a new version of the counterparty and product type matrix.  The 
 counterparties are broken into three sections.  The first section contains 
 counterparties that were included in credits original approved list with 
 limits noted.  The second section contains counterparties that were included 
 in credits second approved list without any limits noted.  The third and last 
 section contains counterparties that will be included in the initial 
 mailshot, but have not yet been reviewed by credit.  Please note that there 
 are also new product types in row 7 that were not on any of the matrices you 
 have previously reviewed.  These new product types are highlighted in yellow 
 and inserted next to similar product types.
 
 Please call me with any questions/comments.
