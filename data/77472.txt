 Kay, I talked with Mark Shaffer in our Atlanta office;  he has no
 information on options in the Hart County area.  Sorry we couldn't help.
 
 
     
 
 I'm looking at the Skelton option (Hart County, GA), and can't figure out
 when it was executed. (must confess I didn't read EVERY word) Can anyone
 help me with this?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
