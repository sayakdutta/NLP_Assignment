 Vince,
 
 I have been meaning to invite you to my home for dinner for some time now, 
 but you havew been so busy lately that I have not made a formal invite.
 
 Please tell me what would be a convenient day, and we can plan for it.  I'd 
 love for you to meet my wife, as well as see our daughter.
 
 Regards,
 Sandeep.
