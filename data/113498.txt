 
 Fine.  
 
 Dick and I have worked out exactly the hours for my group that he will work through mid-Oct.  Why not have Dick submit his charges for your group directly to your assistant?  Bernadette is in DC and having these charges running around the country may cause great confusion.  Finally, since I have not looked at his contract lately, I assume that in using this contract to move forward immediately we are not creating any other obligations with Dick?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Jim
 
  
     
 Jim,
 
 I intend to sign a new contract and become the primary point of contact.  This will probably take several weeks to complete.  I want to use the existing agreement to mobilise services immediately.

 Please give me a call.  I would probably recommend that you sign a new contract with Dick given that we did not intend to renew his option year.

 Jim,
 
 I'm responsible for Asset Development in Enron Transportation Services.  Joe Hartsoe advises that Gov't Affairs has a consulting agreement with Dick Ingersoll for certain regulatory support activities.  I'd like to retain Dick to support commercial activities currently underway and, with your consent, have him bill against the existing agreement with Gov't Affairs.  I would outline the tasks + deliverables for him to complete in call-off letters.  Dick would continue his practice of submitting monthly invoices to Bernadette Hawkins, who could liase with Susan Wadle, my assistant, to validate charges and cost centers.
 
 I understand that Dick's consulting agreement expires in October.  I plan to renew with him going forward.  
 
 Please advise how you wish to proceed.
 
 Regards,
 
 Eric Gadd
