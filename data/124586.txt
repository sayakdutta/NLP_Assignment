 I am going to paper this transaction today and I wanted to be clear that Credit is completely on board.
 
 Velsicol's current booked transaction is 310 mmbtu per day at 140% of IF-HSC through January 31, 2005.
 
 I am going to book 310 mmbtu per day at $5.25 from June through December 2001 and 
 					at IF-HSC  plus $1.50 from January 2002 through January 2005
 				

 
 I believe Tanya and Jason both have given me approval in April but I wanted to verify one last time prior to booking.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Gary
