 
 Dear Dr. McMullen,
 
 A few weeks ago I received a call from your University
 regarding employment opportunities at Enron.
 
 I called back and summarized the  needs of my group (an ideal profile of a 
 candidate):
 
 1. mathematical finance
 2. computer programming (C, C++)
 3. understanding of the energy markets
 
 I shall appreciate any information about potential candidates.
 
 I have also given some other suggestions regarding potential
 opportunities for graduates with different profiles.
 
 Please, feel free to call me. My number is 713 853 3848.
