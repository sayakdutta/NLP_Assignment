 Attached is the first draft of the eCommerce Commercial and Origination 
 Activities Contact List.  This is being prepared for a wider distribution, 
 therefore, please take a moment to review the list carefully and let me know 
 if you have any changes to the list or if you would like to add any 
 additional names to the list that you feel are appropriate.  The purpose of 
 this document is to provide a consistent means for all areas of Enron to 
 direct questions and inquiries related to specific eCommerce issues.
 
 Thank you.
