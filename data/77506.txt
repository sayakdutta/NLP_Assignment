 Matt - Thanks for the explanation.  That makes life much simpler, at least 
 for now.  Illinois is currently the only state where we have employees or 
 inventory.  We are merely purchasing and selling natural gas in the other 
 locations.  If that changes in the future, I will let you know.
 
 As always - thanks for your thorough review,
 
 Gregg
 
 
 
 
    
 Gregg:
 
 We should register Midwest Energy Hub, L.L.C. ("Midwest") for Sales & Use Tax 
 in those states in which Midwest has nexus.  Nexus requires a physical 
 presence (employees or inventory).  If Midwest, in foreign states (outside of 
 Illinois), is merely purchasing and selling natural gas, for delivery by 
 common carrier; Midwest does not have nexus.  Rather, Midwest is acting much 
 like a mail order seller.  
 
 In light of the above, could you please advise regarding Midwest's physical 
 presence in Iowa, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Oklahoma, Texas and 
 Wisconsin.  Thanks.

 Matt - Per our conversation today, the following e-mail was sent by Russell 
 Murrell regarding the impending name change of Midwest Energy Hub, L.L.C.  My 
 understanding is that we have already bought/sold natural gas in Oklahoma, 
 Texas, and Louisianna.  The remaining states in his e-mail are potential 
 future places of business.  I will leave it up to your discretion as to how 
 you want to pursue registering for taxes in these locales.  I am guessing we 
 may want to register in those states we have already transacted in.  Please 
 let me know what you think we should do.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Gregg
