 
 Anurag,
 
 I forwarded the resume to London but I have not heard from
 them. I shall be in London late in June and I shall bring it up
 in person with the IT people.

 Vince,
  
 I  wanted to follow up with you concerning our earlier exchange regarding my  brother Vikas Saksena. Have you had a chance to speak to your IT folks? I will  be meeting with Vikas in London by the end of this month and will get a chance  to talk to him in more detail. May I ask him to call you directly. For your  reference his phone number in London is 44 208 343 3298.
  
 Thanks
