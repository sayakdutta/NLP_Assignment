 
 I have cleared my calendar, so any time in the morning works for me.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Jeff/Michael,
 
 In preparation of Ken Lay's tour through California next week, Steve Kean 
 would like to meet with the two of you (in Houston) on Tuesday morning.  
 Steve's morning is wide open, so please give me a time (one hour) that works 
 with your schedules.  
 
 Please cc Maureen McVicker .  Thanks!
