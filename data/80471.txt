 I just got the tickets the day I left for Telluride.  Why don't we just pick
 you guys up for the game.  We aren't arriving until 3:00 on game day.  We're
 staying at the Breakwater Hotel on South Beach (305) 532-1220.  I will have
 my mobile phone (512) 426-1033.  What Hyatt are you staying at.
 
 Your Spring Break schedule is great.

 Pup,
 
 Hope your holiday is going great.  Talked with your office and got your
 Telluride number but you guys must be out playing.  OU game is coming
 quickly.  Chris is not going down, Mark and I only, and we are arriving to
 Miami on Tuesday afternoon and staying at the Hyatt.  We are out on
 Thursday afternoon.  Golf on Wednesday afternoon at Doral.  It should make
 for a fun trip.
 
 When are you guys going down and where are you staying?  We need to set up
 a time to get together and to get the tickets.  Have you heard anything on
 Hieple (bad spelling) arm?  If he is healthy I would take the points!
 
 We have made reservations for Continental for spring break but need to make
 sure that the timing is fine before we confirm.  We plan to fly out on
 Tuesday and return on Saturday.  I have a scheduling problem to get there
 any earlier.
 
 Give me a call if it is convenient, (713) 853-1450.  I've got a very light
 schedule on Friday, or you can email, whichever is easier.
 
 See you in a couple of days!
 
 Love to all,
 Mike
 
 Go ENE stock, we back to 85!
