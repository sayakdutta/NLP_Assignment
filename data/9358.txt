 
 Thanks for the resume.  She has had some good experience.  Do you know much 
 about her performance here at Enron?  Can I call and talk with her directly?  
 I would certainly keep the conversation confidential at this point.  --Sally

 I am sending you a resume of  Renee Smith, an employee of EBS.
 
 She is considering  a transfer at some point to another position within Enron.
 
 She has a lot of brokerage industry experience and she is very enthusiastic
 about Enron.
 
 No need to mention it's a confidential request.
 
 Have a very happy Thanksgiving.
 
 
 Vince
