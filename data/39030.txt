 would drop you a line.  I am doing good.  I am sorry I missed your call on 
 Saturday night.  I was at home and in bed by 9:30.  I went out until 3 am on 
 Friday night and then Rick and I went skiing on Saturday morning and left at 
 6:30 am.   We were skiing until 7pm up at Meadows so by the time I got home I 
 just went straight to bed I was soooo exhausted.  Skiing was awesome however, 
 and I did really well as I went and had my skis tuned.  What a difference 
 that made.  While I was waiting for them to be tuned I ended up buying new 
 skis, boots and poles.  I can't wait to try them out!  Anyway, things are 
 going good for me.  I am a little depressed however as today is my Dads 
 birthday. Also Cita is back in the hospital again.  She had another heart 
 failure.  She is doing better though.   I am leaving tommorow morning to 
 spend the rest of the week with my sister/visit Cita and then I am going to 
 Vegas on Saturday with Jay, Jimmy, Caitlin, Nicole and a few other people.  I 
 am excited to go and in a way it is kind of a deal for my dad as he loved to 
 go to Vegas for his birthday and the Super bowl weekend.  Anyway, I better 
 run.  I work tonight so email me back so I have something to read for the 
 night shift.  How is everything with you?
