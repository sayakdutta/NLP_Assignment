 
 Cynthia,
 
 All of the deals below have been rebooked except for the one in red.  For 
 some reason I can't find the counterparty in the system.  You may want to 
 check and see if it has been set up yet, if it has let me know the proper 
 name (I may be looking for the wrong counterparty) and I will rebook it as 
 well.
 
 Thanks,
 Susan

 Hi Susan:
 Can you set up the counterparties for the 
 following missing deals?  
 
 NW8878 legs 5-8
 NW8903 legs 5-6
 NW9742 legs 3-4
 NW9790 legs 1-2, 4
 NX1037 legs 1-2
 NX3659 legs 1-4
 NX3790 legs 1-4
 
 I don't know what you're schedule is and I
 know that you're probably really busy.  But,
 let me know when you would be able to 
 set these up.  These are the leftover deals
 from that original list that I submitted to you.
 Thanks for all your help!  I am pulling across
 all the new ones that you set up for me last week.
 I really appreciate it!
