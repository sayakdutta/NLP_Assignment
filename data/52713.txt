 
 Billy,
 
 We had an interview with Bobby and we were not impressed at all.
 
 He started with a statement about his option pricing experience and when we asked 
 a question about a basic concept in this area (the definition of volatility) he could not
 define it. An answer to any question was that he did work in a different  area.
 When we followed up with a question from this area (like quantum physics), he would
 complain that the question is too detailed.
 
 
 He comes across like a classical consultant (many buzzwords, little substance).

 Vince,
 
 Good point.  Just let me know what you think.

 Billy,
 
 We can give Bobby a call and carry out a preliminary interview over the phone.
 I am always a bit suspicious when I see somebody trying
 to leave a very good company after a relatively short time.

 Vince,
 
 This person looks "scary smart", and when I see that, I always think of you.  Please let me know what you think.
 
 Hope all is well with you,
 Billy

 Bobby,
 
 Thank you for your interest in Enron.  I've copied Traci Warner who leads recruiting for our program.  Traci or someone from her team will follow up with you.
 
 Regards,
 Billy Lemmons

 I hope all is well.  Per our discussion today, provided as an attachment are
 my cover letter and resume.
 
 Kind Regards,
 Bobby Demissie
