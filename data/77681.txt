 made to expedite the process, and I do think the first time will take the 
 longest for obvious reasons. 
 
 For the purposes of scheduling going forward, I think it would help to keep 
 that type of time frame in mind, with the thought that maybe it can happen 
 more quickly.

 Thanks for the email.  However I am a bit concern that the 2 - 4 processing 
 of the forms may not support the Austin Energy construction schedule.  I am 
 working on that and will let you know if it does or does not.
 
 Thanks,
