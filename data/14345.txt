 I have no idea.  You know, if you call the insurance company they can recommend someone.  Are your eyes OK?
 
 
 Andrea recommends Dr. Cheryl Pickering as an optician (eyeglasses and stuff...) 
 Elizabeth recommends Dr. Milton Boniek as an ophthalmologist (for surgery and serious eye stuff...)
 
 Hope this helps!

 Hey Vik,
 
 Since you live close to me do you know any good eye doctor in that area? Can you please recommend?
 
 Thanks,
 Monika
