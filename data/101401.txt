Tomorrow you will want to roll the file over to the new month...Errol should be able to help you with that.  Make sure you also follow the Liquidation instructions for the gas daily post-id's...you can find them on that color coded sheet George has.
 
 Swing by if you need anything else.

 what changes need to be made to the P&L GDOPTIONS file?  Can you remember?
 
 
  
     
 what is it exactly you need help with...maybe i can answer your questions via email.
 
  
     
 Susan,
 
 Do you think you could stop by George's desk this afternoon when you
 have a free moment. We need a little help as it is end of month!
 
 Thanks,
 
 Sean
