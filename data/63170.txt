 All;
 
 As requested yesterday in the VP PRC Committee meeting, the following 
 comprises a list of your Business Unit VP's who have  either not accessed 
 HRGIS or not fully completed the required information. The following 
 information is considered critical for PRC profiles:-
 
 - Current Responsibilities (VP to input info)
 - Date of Promotion to VP (VP to audit info for accuracy)
 - Date of Hire (VP to audit info for accuracy)
 - Photo
 
 
 Access information:
 
 To access HRGIS, via the HRWeb intranet site, the employee will need to use 
 their SSN (no dashes) as the Logon ID, and their password is their data of 
 birth YYYY/MM/DD. 
 
 Please contact me if you have any questions or need further information. 
 Thanks in advance, 
 
 Gina Corteselli
