 
 Thanks!
 
  
     
 This actually went out for signature yesterday afternoon.
 
  
     
 Cindy:
 
 Has this guaranty been processed?  We've received the original signed master agreement from the counterparty and need to deliver the original Enron Corp. Guaranty.
 
 Thanks!

 Hi, Cindy:
 
 I'm assisting EBS in some of their trading work for awhile, so this is why I am sending you the attached memo requesting an Enron Corp. Guaranty.
 
 Please let me know when the guaranty is ready and I'll arrange for pick-up.
 
 Thanks!
