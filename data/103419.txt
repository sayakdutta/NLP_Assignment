 mansion was FAB! and we bought a Piero Fornasetti table (that belonged to 
 Stanley Marcus) at a neat shop called Collage.  I am currently into Danish 
 modern and bought a Poul Kjaareholm chair at the annual Knoll sale (and I 
 know that the owner of Collage is Danish [modern!!!]).  Star Canyon was 
 outstanding and we had a delicious bottle of pinot from Williams & Selyems 
 (which we had been trying to locate).  And, yes, we went to a museum with 
 Mike's mother and then for Mexican food.  We also saw "Run, Lola, Run" which 
 is a cool German film with English subtitles.  I wish you would show Mother 
 how to send e-mail and just get to search engine like Yahoo! so that she 
 could check her stock portfolio periodically.  I spoke with Daddy this 
 morning but he had to cut me off as usual.  See you soon, dahling!  CALL ME 
 when you get this message.  Sass

 Dear Sass,
 
 Did you go to Dallas?  Did you have fun in Dallas?  How was your July 4?
 Zachary called yesterday from his trip out of camp.  He told me that his
 counselor has stolen a bunch of his clothes.  I'm not sure if I believe
 him.  I think he may have just lost everything.
 
 Let me know if you get this.
 
 I miss you.
 
 Debba
