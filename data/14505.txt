 In the never ending world of changes at Enron, upper management has determined that we will not be using the PEP system for feedback this year.   I apologize that this decision was made after you put time into selecting reviewers and completing reviews.   I have not received word on whether ETS year-end feedback will occur in any alternate form.  
 
 As a result of this development, the feedback training session for this afternoon is cancelled.
