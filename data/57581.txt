 agreed to shelve the legislation for this session.  He said he had been 
 hearing from several others, including Proctor and Gamble (which has a big 
 facility in his district) that the legislation was not going to help 
 competition develop in the state.  He expressed willingness to work with us 
 on a better package and also expressed interest in coming to Enron's 
 offices.  He is going to be in San Antonio in August and would like to come 
 to Houston around that time.
