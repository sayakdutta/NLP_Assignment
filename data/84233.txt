 Gerald,
 
 Greg and SCS recommended we put a cap in for our expenditures on operation 
 costs that HPL was willing to eat for the HPL Operated Facilities.  I have 
 modified section 5 accordingly for your review:
 
 5. Operation.  RNP shall operate and maintain the RNP Facilities in 
 accordance with sound and prudent natural gas industry practice and shall be 
 fully responsible for the routine operation and maintenance thereof and for 
 all cost and expense associated therewith.  HPL shall operate and maintain or 
 cause the operation and maintenance of the HPL Facilities in accordance with 
 the Standards and with sound and prudent natural gas pipeline industry 
 practice and shall be fully responsible for the operation and maintenance 
 thereof and for all cost, expense and risk associated therewith.  HPL shall 
 operate and maintain or cause the operation and maintenance of the HPL 
 Operated Facilities in accordance with the Standards and with sound and 
 prudent natural gas pipeline industry practice and shall be fully responsible 
 for the routine operation and maintenance thereof and for all cost, expense 
 and risk associated therewith, except RNP shall be fully responsible for any 
 cost and expense associated with any repairs, maintenance, and capital 
 expenditures that are in excess of $3,000.00 for a single item (the 
 "Maintenance Items").  HPL shall invoice RNP for the Maintenance Items 
 performed by HPL on the HPL Operated Facilities, and RNP shall pay such 
 invoice within 15 days of its receipt thereof.  RNP shall be responsible for 
 any Meter Fee assessed, as defined in Section 3 above, and for the electric 
 power and phone service, required for the Interconnect.
