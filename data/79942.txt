 
 Thanks for the email.  Reorganize and grow this business?  Not me??!  Upon 
 first look, this business appears to have huge opportunities and ones that 
 can be executed upon, especially if they consider themselves a core 
 business.  It will  be a big challenge but we will make it work in a big 
 way.  A lot of people have tried to make this business work.
 
 I'll follow-up on Treasury Connect, thanks for the heads up.
 
 By the way, science is Gary's passion and he has an undergraduate and MS in 
 chemistry.  He might be an interesting guy to get involved (at least at the 
 edges) with this project.  I told him about it and he really would like to 
 get invited to the next meeting.  What do you think?  It always helps to have 
 an avid supporter in a new business.

 Congrats!  Those guys better watch out, you might organize them.
 
 FYI, we have an investment in a company called Treasury Connect that has an 
 interest rate swap portal.  Gary is working with them to do a trade.  They 
 are currently negotiating with the World Bank to provide a private label 
 product to them.
 
 TC's clients include Xerox, GE, Duke and us.  I know with the webification of 
 everything that we will be looking at those markets, but I would like to make 
 sure our guys evaluate their technology offering before you move to far into 
 their market.  They are focused on the very low value, commoditized 
 transactions, so I don't know if it is an area Enron will compete for.
 
 Thanks,
 Mark
