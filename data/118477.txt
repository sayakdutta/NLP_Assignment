 
 I suggest you insert "with respect to the Transactions" after the word 
 "Counterparty" in the second line of paragraph 1.  Otherwise they look great 
 to me.

 PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
 SOLICITOR-CLIENT COMMUNICATION
 
 Attached are:
 
 1. the revised Termination Agreement with BMO; and
 2. the draft Termination Agreement with Banque Paribas.
 
 With respect to the BMO Termination Agreement once the deal is finalized, I 
 only require:
 
 1. the Agreement date;
 2. the Effective Date;
 3.  the payment amount; and
 4. the payment date.
 
 With respect to the Paribas Termination Agreement, I will need the same 
 information, as well as to confirm the date of the ISDA Master and deal 
 identification numbers/legs and to obtain copies of the Confirmation 
 Letters.  I will try to track down this ancillary information today, but I 
 realize it is U.S. Thanksgiving.  Otherwise, I will follow-up Monday morning.
 
 Regards, Peter
