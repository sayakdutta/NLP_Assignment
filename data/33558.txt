 
 Hey team.  I changed the wire date to Friday and I updated the MTM value on the cash request.  Ed signed the wire and its sitting on Doug's desk.
 
 Thanks.

 The prepay to Reliant for Thur April 11th is $22,000.  I left the Cash Request on Doug's desk.
 
 Priscilla, please leave the wire on my desk in the future.  I need to get Ed to sign before it goes to Doug Sewell.
