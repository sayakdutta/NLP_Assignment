 One guy, John Neslage, from Corporate/Regulatory Affairs is putting together 
 a talk for state regulators and wants to talk about fundamental modeling of 
 energy prices.  He was wondering if our group could shed some light on major 
 fundamental variables, possibly even for new commodity markets.  I am not 
 sure if we have done much fundamental analysis, since we focus mostly on 
 option valuation.  Also, since market power is an important variable, 
 marginal cost analysis is not sufficient, but if anybody has any info, please 
 let me know.  I have referred him to the "Managing Energy Price Risk" book.
 
 Thanks,
  Vasant
