 	me Mike Belcher's phone number.  He is the person coordinating all the condensate
 	issues.  If we send a letter I would send it to Terry Spencer and reference Mike Belcher.
 	If you need more, let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

 Jim,
 Here is another matter I need to really push, a letter demanding payment of the Mt. Jesus condensate reimbursement short payments.  Please review this letter and give me your observations, suggestions. << File: Mt Jesus2.doc >> 
 
 Lynn,
 Any better name than Spencer to send this to?  
 
 Dan/Mark
 Can you get me updated numbers?  Here is a spreadsheet that Debbie provided to me.   << File: Mt. Jesus Shortpay Analysis.xls >>
