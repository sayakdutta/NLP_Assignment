 >  Dividing into 10 groups of three, the only rule was they had to use
 >past  ad  slogans that captured the essence of Viagra.

 A couple drove several miles down a country road, not saying a word.
 
   An earlier discussion had led to an argument and neither wanted to concede
   their position.
 
   As they passed a barnyard full of mules and pigs, the husband
 sarcastically
   asked, "Relatives of yours?"
 
   "Yep," the wife replied, "in-laws."
