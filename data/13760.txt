My view is that we should encourage people to be contacted while out on leave to identify reviewers and submit a self-evaluation.  Presumably, if they have a Click at Home PC, they can do it from there.  If not, we should be able to facilitate it manually.  Your thoughts?

 Michelle,
 I received the below message, but still have questions:
 
 If someone has been on leave for less than 12 weeks, but is currently out, what should we do in terms of selecting reviewers for them?  Should the supervisor select?  What should we do in terms of the self evaluation of listing 5 accomplishments that will be flashed on the screen during PRC meetings?  Should we just leave theirs blank?  If it is blank will it be viewed as a negative?  Can the supervisor contact the individual at home to ask them who they want for reviewers and what do they want to put for 5 accomplishments?  If the employee knows that we are going through this process and wants to select reviewers and do their accomplishments from home, should we allow that since they are on leave? 
 
 Sorry to throw all of these questions at you, but the EES HR group has thrown them at me and I agreed to send you one e-mail to keep from all of us contacting you.  
 Also, I need to get information from you on what to do in submitting my list of PRC attendees to you for review in terms of diversity.  It would be helpful if I understood what exactly you want and what you are looking for.
 
 Any gudance you can provide on these matters would be appreciated.

 We have decided that someone who is out for more than 12 weeks during the review period should not be reviewed.  That guideline should be communicated to all of HR soon.  Michelle
