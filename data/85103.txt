 
 Chris,  My comments are as follows:
 
  1.    The term (Article 4) was revised from the previous draft (month to 
 month) to now being a definitive term with no evergreen provision.  Is this   
 acceptable commerically?  Should we add an evergreen provision on to the end 
 of the current definitive term?
 
  2.  Section  9.9 - Doesn't give a time frame for this approval process.  
 Hattiesburg has no obligations under this agreement until this approval 
 occurs.   What if it doesn't occur for 3 years?  Need either (i) ability to 
 walk away from this agreement if not done by date certain, or (ii) assurances 
 from   Hattiesburg that this is a short process or has already been 
 accomplished.
 
  3.  Definition 1.2 in the GTC of "day".  Does this day match the gas day for 
 the interstate pipelines?  If not will this cause problems in scheduling. 
 
  4.  General Comment:  Does this interruptible agreement provide the level of 
 service that this power plant will commercially   require?  Hattiesburg can 
 interrupt service at any time at  its discretion and furthermore, never 
 provide service under this   agreement by indicating to Caledonia that its 
 storage capacity is full with other storage committments.  Does this work?
