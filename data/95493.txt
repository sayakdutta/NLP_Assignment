 
 Steve,
 
 Not a lot.  Just working and watching my company's stock get the
 shit kicked out of it.  
 
 I did get married last year, but everything else has been pretty quiet.
 How 'bout yourself.  What have you been up to?  Who have you kept in 
 touch with?
 
 Kevin
 
 
     
 
 Sorry you can't make it.  We'll miss ya!
 
 What have you been up to lately?
 
 
     
 
 Steve,
 
 Hope everything is going well.  Unfortunately I won't be able to attend
 the reunion.  Hope you have a great time.  Talk to you soon.
 
 Kevin

 Dear Class of 1996,
 
 **Note:  Response to this email requested, thanks!
 
 Well, our much anticipated 5-year Reunion is less than a month away!
 The
 planning committe is working hard on the events, and we are trying to
 firm
 up the list of attendees.  We got a GREAT response to the last email,
 thanks
 for taking the time to let us know your status.  If you haven't
 responded
 yet, please do so just so we can adequately reserve space.
 
 Just to remind some of you, the event will take place on: *** November
 2-4th
 *** in Los Angeles, CA!   The rough schedule of events is shown below.
 In a
 subsequent email today or tomorrow we will provide some details about
 hotel
 accommodations.  You will also be receiving an information packet from
 the
 Alumni Office in a mailing that should be out next week.
 
 If you are planning to fly I've heard there are some great deals on
 Southwest and United among others (<$100 from SF).  Anderson Alums also
 get
 a 10% on Southwest (see below)
 
 If you would like to respond to this email regarding your status, please
 use
 this form:
 
 1) Status of your email account
 	A)  Got this info - email address is correct
 	B)  Got this info - but would prefer to use another address next
 time
 	C)  I did not get this info (not sure how you would answer this,
 but...)
 
 Note:  You may have received this note twice - it was sent to all
 members of
 the Class of 1996 currently registered in the Alumni Database, as well
 as to
 the Class of 1996 Email List (which is opt-in).
 
 2) Plans for attending the Reunion Weekend
 	A)  Will definitely be Attending
 	B)  Will make a brief appearance (1 or 2 events)
 	C)  Still Deciding
 	D)  Will not be Attending (but wish I could)
 
 3) Comments/Suggestions - Any thoughts on how to make this a GREAT
 reunion?
 
 As mentioned previously, its been a rough year for many of us and it
 would
 be great to end the year with some fun and good times!  I can tell you
 from
 what we've been hearing, and from the number of responses received, that
 we
 are going to have an awesome turnout for the events, so you don't want
 to
 miss out!!!   So get your tickets, review your facebook (so who was that
 Doug Dahl character anyways), dust off the old Anderson attire and let's
 party!!
 
 Sincerely,
 Steve Smith
