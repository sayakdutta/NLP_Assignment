 
 Robin & Jeff:
 
 Mary Hain asked that I advise you she had one change to the information she 
 gave you yesterday.  
 
 Instead of saying, "It doesn't mean the FERC hasn't set a rate..."
 you should say, "It doesn't mean the FERC has accepted a rate and that a rate 
 isn't on file".
 
 If you have any questions about this, you can contact Mary on her cell phone 
 (503/807-0928) AFTER 12:45pm Cnetral Time.
