 
 I sent Kari Dohn some more information today--thanks, Jim, for the 
 Pennsylvania info.  In the note, I asked her if the rumors about 
 securitization are true, and whether the Governor, indeed, intends to push it 
 actively.  
 
 I also mentioned that we viewed it as a very promising option, particularly 
 if accompanied by significant concessions by the utilities.  The response 
 from Kari is very encouraging, and will hopefully help the utilities' credit 
 position, though I heard PG&E was downgraded to junk by at least one credit 
 agency today, but haven't confirmed it.  
 
 Think it's prudent to keep Kari's info very close to the vest--here's 
 Kari'her response:
 
 Jeff -- thank you so much for the information!
 
 Re:  securitization, I don't think the exact form has been decided in terms
 of legislation, but its fair to say there are very active discussions at the
 highest level regarding the best way to do this (with good support, between
 us, it appears).  All major parties will need to be supportive.
