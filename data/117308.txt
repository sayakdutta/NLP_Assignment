 Mark:  (1)  Did you consider my voice mail about updating authorized trader 
 lists and resolutions (by Samantha or Tana)?
 
 (2)  Have you thought about electronic notice provisions?  Shouldn't 
 default/termination notices be in writing to the appropriate counsel/Corp. 
 secretary?  And, can we agree to "electronic notices" at all?  There is no 
 electronic address for a Documentation Desk or Assistant General Counsel.  I 
 am seeing this type of provision in electronic trading agreements.
 
 Thanks.  Sara
