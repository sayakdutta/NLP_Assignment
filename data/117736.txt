 
 Thanks Justin - I was planning to come over some time shortly after the first 
 of the year.   A month or two ago Mark H. mentioned that there might be an 
 ISDA meeting in January that he wants me to attend so I'll probably try to 
 schedule something around then.  I believe that's around the 28th.  Let's try 
 to set up dinner again!

 Hi Mark,
 
 The document we use is an adaption of the Enron Master Swap Contract, but 
 tailored for a single one-off swap deal.
 
 When are you over next?
 
 Hope to see you shortly!

 What documents do we use for these deals?  Is it the German translation of 
 our Industrial Master?
