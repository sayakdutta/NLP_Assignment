 
 Dear John,
 
 On May 9, 2000, you sent a cover memo along with a business proposal for CMI 
 to Jeff Skilling.  That e-mail was inadvertently deleted, but fortunately not 
 before Jeff saw a printed copy.
 
 Jeff has asked that you send that e-mail to Dan Leff in EES for review.  Upon 
 his review, a determination will be made as to whether or not Enron will 
 pursue this opportunity.
 
 Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
 
 Regards,
 Sherri Sera
 on behalf of Jeff Skilling
