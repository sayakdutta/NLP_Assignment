 I want to move next weekend.  If we can start at 2 PM on Friday it would be fine.

 John, 
 
 After your conversation with Paul yesterday, we have evaluated the option of moving all of GAS and POWER next weekend, we will be able to move everyone in a single move, however we will need a firm commitment by midday Tuesday, in order for us to get the workforce, move the broker lines and all the other tasks associated with this scale of move.
 
 If you would like to proceed, please let me or Bill Donovan know as soon as practicable, so we can facilitate the migration. 
 
 If we do not move next weekend, this will cause real problems with the resources and contracts in place, staff and suppliers are on vacation through thanksgiving and the move data will soon be out of date which will need to be reconciled which would increase the cost.
