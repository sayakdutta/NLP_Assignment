 This is a reminder to the email that was sent to you on May 17th from Kim Melodick regarding the Enron Americas Commercial PRC.  I would like to remind you of ALL of the scheduled PRC meetings.  This short list will not include your individual group PRC meetings.  I believe that there has been some confussion.
