 
 I'm assuming that's the law suit related to your former employer?  Sorry to hear about the hand that rocks the cradle!!!  So have you found a new nanny?
 
 I REALLY REALLY REALLY need a vacation soon, so we should talk!  Vegas could be "in the cards" by late July or August, but maybe we can do something prior to that even...I've had sort of a bad last couple of months....we can get into that in more detail later.
 
 So, do you like the new job?  How's Ethan doing?  Any non-psycho love interests?
