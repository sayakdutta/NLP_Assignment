 
 Thanks.  I was glad to do it and would do it again... next time my computer 
 will work.
 I benefitted a great deal from what I heard from the group, especially 
 regarding the PRC.

 FYI -- we conducted a post-event survey on opinions about the HR employee 
 meeting held last month and the HR management team thought you should know 
 that participants rated your presentation very high.
 
 When asked what should be kept the same next time, participants commented as 
 follows about your presentation:
 "I think a presentation from Corporate HR is of great value."
 "Keep the presentations by the officers . . . to talk about the business."
 "I liked having other people from ETS/Enron there to better understand the 
 big picture and where Enron is going."
 "Continue to bring in invited guests to keep the group apprised of Corporate 
 activities. I liked the opportunity to hear both Stan and Steve--the field 
 staff don't get as many opportunities to hear from corporate management."
 "Visits by Steve Kean and Stan Horton. Their perspectives are very good . . ."
 
 Clearly, your participation provided much value to the group and we 
 appreciate very much your taking the time to come meet with us and share 
 information. 
 
 You should expect that we'll be asking you to come back again!
 
 Regards, - Roger
