 Pls send Alan the overviews you and Ray put together earlier - thanks.

 As I talked with Jim yesterday, Belden would like a short overview of the refund proceedings:  schedule, key issues, etc.
 
 If you can pass on whatever you have I can prepare such a memo.  Or let me know and I can call Fergus.
 
 Thnks.
