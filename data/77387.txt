 
 Can the gas company also make the same requests?  
 
 
 
 
 
 




 
  
 The NC Attorney General asserts a statutory right to intervene which I think
 misreads the statute but which the Commission has always allowed.  The AG
 routinely intervenes.  I suspect that in this case they are interested in
 the possibility of bypass and the merchant plant issue.  I will call Len
 Green today to find out.  The AG can make the same discovery requests that
 the Public Staff makes, subject, as was the case with the Public Staff, to
 the execution of a confidentiality agreement.  
 
 



  
 
 Hi Allyson,
 
 What is your impression of why the NC attorney general's office has
 intervened in the CPCN proceeding?  Is this typical?  Does the AG's office
 (or any other intervenor) have any special rights to discover any of the
 confidential information we file?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
