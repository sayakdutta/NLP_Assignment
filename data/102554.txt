 
 I am very excited about my trip to London.  For one thing I get to visit 
 Emily, but at this point more importantly I don't have to think about work 
 for 6 days straight.  You guys are going to have a great trip to China and I 
 say if you find a rug that you really like (i.e. you're not just getting one 
 because you think you should) you should definitely get it.  Just think what 
 a great conversation piece it would make over the years.  
 
 And don't worry about my appetite for travel getting spoiled...that is 
 impossible.  I can't wait to see you guys.  I think that you being in Korea 
 and Emily being in London has made this whole Ted situation that much harder 
 to deal with.  I've realized how much I appreciate y'alls insights now that 
 they aren't as easy to get.
 
 Love ya,
 Susan
