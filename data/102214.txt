 The suction strainer was removed last night.  The piping spool was=20
 reinstalled without the major compressor alignment problems that were=20
 expected.  This significantly reduced the downtime necessary for the remova=
 l=20
 of the suction strainer.
 
 No major foreign materials were found in the strainer.  Some small weld bea=
 ds=20
 were found.  There were some signs that the strainer may have been vibratin=
 g.
 
 Several compressor test runs were made early this AM to measure the vibrati=
 on=20
 levels without the suction strainer.  The high frequency vibration was=20
 reduced to safe levels.  There is no longer any risk to the unit piping=20
 integrity.
 
 The compressor bearing vibration did not decrease due to the removal of the=
 =20
 strainer.  Rolls will continue to assess the collected vibration data to=20
 determine the cause of the high drive end bearing vibration and construct a=
 =20
 game plan.
 
 The station once again became available for service around 4 AM.  The=20
 compressor may or may not be run dependent on need.  Gallup Ops and Gas=20
 Control are in close contact.
 
 The station will be manned if the compressor is running due to Gas Control=
 =20
 being unable to send remote setpoints to the station controller.  The probl=
 em=20
 stems from OPTO-22 not supporting the particular Modbus function required t=
 o=20
 send setpoints.  This is a =01+lack of functionality=01, in the new LCM4 ve=
 rsion=20
 controllers/software utilized on the Gallup Project. =20
 
 EECC has been in contact with OPTO-22 to determine the time table for=20
 resolving this problem.  EECC, TW Ops are working on a temporary fix to=20
 enable Gas Control to send remote setpoints to Gallup.  Gas Control is=20
 currently able to monitor data from Gallup.
 
 Some instrumentation will be replaced today that failed due to the high=20
 vibration over the fast few days.
 
 Final tuning of the station control loops and surge control will be also be=
 =20
 conducted today.
