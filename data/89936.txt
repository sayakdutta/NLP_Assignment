 
 Fine.   I don't need to attend.
 
  
     
 Kevin this summit is right after the hourly Las Vegas trip and I would like to attend.  There is no costs associated with this summit, ESCA is covering the accommodations and I will all ready be in Las Vegas.
 
 Did you want to attend?  
 
 I was told by ESCA that some of our regulatory folks attended last year.
