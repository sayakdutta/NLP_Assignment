 No problem.  Sean paid me for his and Molly's dinner and Eldon and Nancy will 
 pay me for theirs.  No problem on the toast--I'm sure the favor will be 
 repaid many times over.  Rite Spot is always great.  I actually got to bed by 
 11:30, so I was OK yesterday.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Dude,
 
 Thanks for everything last night. I know Cameron had a great time. Do you 
 want me to help you collect funds for dinner? Also, thanks especially for 
 reminding me to give a toast; I had totally spaced! That was fun at Rite 
 Spot, too.
 
 I hope today is not too painful.
 
 Scott
