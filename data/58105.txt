 Steve,
 
 Attached please find the pro-regulation speech.  We have a studio reserved
 between 4 and 5 PM today.  If it's possible to get comments on the speeches
 before the conference call, we would really appreciate it.  I'll forward the
 edited deregulation speech to you shortly.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Liz
