In the process of having the Navajo EPA take over the drinking water program for the Tribe, the EPA as overseer wants to be kept in the loop for a little while longer.  In light of this, we need to not only send to the EPA all monthly sampling reports for drinding, but also to the Yolanda Barney of the Navanl Nation.  I spoke with Danny about this and he said that the EPAs involvement would start  to deminish in the future but he didnt when.
 
  
     
 Larry-
 Do we or do we not have send analysis results to Danny every month?  I thought you said to only send them to Navajo Nation EPA (Yolanda Barney) so that's what I was doing.
