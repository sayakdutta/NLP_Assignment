 Mark-
 
 We have been discussing whether to have a press breakfast or other press
 contacts in Houston for the March 6 conference.  We think there could be
 some interesting media coverageand press interest.  
 
 I look forward to your thoughts and would be happy to have a short call to
 explore further Monday. Please advise.
 
 Thanks and regards, Ruth
