 RE: NOx SIP Call Implementation - Draft EPSA Letters to Michigan
                 and North Carolina Attached
 ? Comments Due By Wednesday, April 4th, Close of Business
 
 Most of the 19 states subject to the NOx-SIP Call rule have submitted draft 
 or final plans to revise their state implementation plans (SIPs) to meet the 
 rule's emission-reduction requirements.  U.S. EPA is in various stages of 
 reviewing and taking action on the plans.  It is expected that Northeastern 
 states' plans will generally be acted upon first since they were among the 
 first to be submitted.
 
 North Carolina and Michigan are both in the process of finalizing their plans 
 for implementing the NOx SIP-Call rule.  Both of their rules, as currently 
 drafted, contain approaches of particular concern to merchant suppliers.  
 Specifically, both feature provisions that could limit significantly the 
 number of allowances available to new generating facilities.
 
 EPSA has drafted comments to these states advocating more reasonable 
 approaches, which will be more likely to ensure sufficient allowances to 
 support capacity additions.  A copy of the drafts is attached for review.  
 Please provide any comments on the letter to Samantha Slater at (202) 

 Wednesday, April 4th.  Please contact Samantha Slater at EPSA for further 
 information.
