 We have completed the preliminary Transammonia valuation analysis with an 
 equity range of $70MM to $80MM (enterprise value of $250MM to $260MM).  The 
 conditional and non-binding letter to the counterparty will be faxed today 
 with an equity range of $60MM to $80MM.  I lowered the bottom end of the 
 range to $60MM for negotiation purposes.
 
 Attached is a presentation we've put together focusing on Transammonia's 
 business, deal specifics, and our financial valuation.
