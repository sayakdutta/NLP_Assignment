 The following short quiz consists of 4 questions and tells whether you are
 qualified to be a "professional". Scroll down for each answer. The questions
 are not that difficult.
 
 1.  How do you put a giraffe into a refrigerator?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The correct answer is: Open the refrigerator, put in the giraffe and close
 the door. This question tests whether you tend to do simple things in an
 overly complicated way.
 
 2.  How do you put an elephant into a refrigerator?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Wrong answer: Open the refrigerator, put in the elephant and close the
 refrigerator.
 
 The correct answer is: Open the refrigerator, take out the giraffe,
 put in the elephant and close the door. This tests your ability to
 think through the repercussions of your actions.
 
 3.  The Lion King is hosting an animal conference. All the animals
 attend except one. Which animal does not attend?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The correct answer is: The Elephant. The Elephant is in the refrigerator.
 This tests your memory. Okay, even if you did not answer the first three
 questions correctly, you still have one more chance to show your abilities.
 
 4.  There is a river you must cross, but it is inhabited by crocodiles. How
 do you manage it?
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The correct answer is: You swim across.  All the Crocodiles are attending
 the Animal Meeting. This tests whether you learn quickly from your mistakes.
 According to Andersen Consulting Worldwide, around 90% of the professionals
 they tested got all 4 questions wrong. But many preschoolers got several
 correct answers. Anderson Consulting says this conclusively disproves the
 theory that most professionals have the brains of a four year old.
