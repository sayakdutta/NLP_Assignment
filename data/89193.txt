 Chris forwarded a message to me, indicating that there might be some confusion as to the attachments. In order to alleviate any confusion and to assist in speeding up the process, I am attaching a copy of the same document draft I sent yesterday. Please let me know if you are unable to open this and we will work out some other method.
 Thanks for your help,
 Lora
