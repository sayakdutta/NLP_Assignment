 
 Agustin,
 
 I am trying to confirm the counterparty on one of your deals so that it can 
 be properly assigned in TAGG.  The ticket for the deal in question reads 
 Barcel Mexico.  However, I spoke recently with Beatrice Reyna who informed me 
 that you believed the counterparty to be one of the Bimbo companies.  If you 
 wouldn't mind looking into this and getting back to me with the correct 
 counterparty name it would be much appreciated.
 
 Thanks,
 Susan
