 Elizabeth,
 I am having trouble getting a churn processed for Holly Strong.  According to Judy Martin, a churn cannot be processed
 without the approval of a VP or above.
 Holly is currently based at the Ardmore facility but needs a space here.  All she needs is 
 a desk and a phone.  We already have equipment for her to use, so nothing has to be ordered.
 Can you please ask Steve if he can approve this request?  All that needs to be done is an email with Steve's approval
 to Judy with the referenced request #11385.
 Thank you.
 
 
 
 
  
     
 Clare,
 
 This move can not be scheduled until we receive an approval.
 
 Please forward this request to a Vice President or an Officer of the Company.
 
 Thank you,

 Clare,
 
 EPSC has been requested that each relocation request submitted is an "essential business" move.  When this has been established, it must be approved by a Vice President and/or an Officer of the Company of the requesting department.  Your request will be scheduled once approval is received.
 
 Please have the approval sent to Judy Martin.
 
 Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.
