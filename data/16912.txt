 unequaled.  can't thank you enough.  were there any materials giving more 
 specifics of what the governor proposed today?
 
 thanks very much.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Governor Davis held a press conference earlier today at the Calpine Sutter
 Power Plant project where he unveiled his plan to increase generating
 capacity by boosting output at existing power facilities, accelerating power
 plant construction, streamlining the review process for new facilities, and
 providing incentives for distributed and renewable generation.
 
 In addition, Governor Davis appointed Larry Hamlin of Fountain Valley as
 California's energy construction czar. Mr. Hamlin is on a leave of absence
 from Southern California Edison where he serves as Vice President of Power
 Production and Operations and Maintenance Services.
 
 IEP is releasing a statement in response which I will forward shortly.
 
 Thanks,
 Jean
