 Mark: Do you know off the top of your head who Enron uses in Frankfurt,
 Germany?  
 
 I am trying to help out someone who is looking for a U.S. firm (or a firm
 with a U.S. office) that also has an office in Frankfurt, to assist with a
 large business transaction.
 
 Many thanks.
 
 
 Hope you are doing well.
