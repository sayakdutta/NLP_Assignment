 
 I agree with your statements on phase II. I'll start working on the priorities and requirements.
 
 Also, what is the status of Colleen?

 Zhiyong Wei to be added to signature lists.
 Timeline to include production dates - ie include UAT and production roll-out dates.
 Dependencies - where there are dependencies on other groups (any interaction required with any group outside of Zheiyong's), these need to be highlighted and a representative from that group needs to sign off on that portion of the timeline ( a representative can not be below Director level in the organiztion).
 
 There are clearly many people rolling off early in this project who can be utilized for Phase II - I would suggest the specfication for Phase II is completed in the very near future as the majority of the work in this is done in the very short term by the developers and it moves to the test team.
 
 Please re-issue today.

 I understand we have now finalized 90% requirements on the GTV II.
 
 Please could we pull together the format inception document this week for signature on your meeting next week with Geof and Colleen.
