 it's easier, I can come to you...I know you guys are swamped.  SRS
 
 PS - I didn't realize that I sent you an e-mail from Jeff's box - didn't mean 
 to alarm you if I did!

 Sherri-
 
 This is not a problem.  I probably can't get them with the other two but they 
 will be in the same area.  I will bring them up some time this afternoon.  
 Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks!
 
 Greg

 Greg, if there are two more tickets available for sale for Friday's game, I'd 
 like to buy them.  Let me know.  Thanks, SRS
