 approach you want to take with the documents.  I'll call in for the meeting 
 with Stan tomorrow.  I have the phone number.  Sorry we got cut off on the 
 MOPS issue today.  I'm a little communication impaired up here, but I'll call 
 on Wed. or Thur. on MOPS.  in the mean time, please grab whoever you need 
 from my group to get the thinking underway on the new strategy.  Thanks.  DF

 These look fine to me. My sense is that Stan will go over Northern's offer in 
 the initial phone call with Ted Davis; therefore it may make sense to just 
 combine the two for Stan's purpose but keep the 2nd one seperate as the basis 
 for a document to fax to Davis after the phone call.
