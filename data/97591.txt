 Please forward to Alan Yudkowsky, Richard Sanders, Pat Mar and me your
 suggestions for proposed counsel to handle the commandeering litigation.  I
 would like to schedule a Committee meeting to consider the candidates as
 soon as possible after the Court approves the Stipulation at the May 17
 hearing.
 
 Thanks.
