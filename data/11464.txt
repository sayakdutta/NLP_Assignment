 Ricky . . Economist is working with Enron  pretty extensively.  You're on the roster for the upcoming NYC eBusiness  event and everyone is absolutely convinced you're best of breed on this  'managing risk inherent in transitioning to ebusiness model' that I asked about  yesterday.
 May we keep your name (placeholder?) in brochure  and plan to identify another person to fill-in closer to the event  date?
 Please?
