     if Jean does not have time.  Just thought I would throw that out there if there is an interest.  Thanks. Lynn
 
 
     
 
 FYI, I have reserved some dollars for PDA's or the new blackberry devices.  As soon as Jean gets her blackberry she will demonstrate the features of each device so you can determine what best fits your needs.
