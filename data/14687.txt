 
 Does Fri at 10 work for you?  I may be in tomorrow too after I make sure Alina won't freak out with the babysitter.
 
 Next week sounds fine for vacation.
 
 I wasn't able to use the global phone in Kazakhstan. But a friend recently rented one and used in Europe.  The neat thing is that you use you're reg cell number.
 
 Playdate sounds great
 
 Talk to you tomorrow.
