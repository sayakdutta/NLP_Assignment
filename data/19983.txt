 
 Sounds reasonable.  Let me know what time you can meet this weekend.  After noon on Saturday, and  anytime before 4 pm on Sunday works great for me.
 
 Understanding that it's a T&M job, would you nonetheless be able to give a ballpark figure once we've spoken this weekend and you've had a chance to think about it?
 
 Also, I've got some longer range plans (barn, house, etc.) for the property that I'd like to run by you, too, but that's longer off.  Really want to get the deck done before the rain starts.
 
 Thanks again.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
 
 
     
 
 Hello Jeff,
 
 This would be a project that we, my guys and I would take on, not just a side job.  I propose we do the job on a T& M basis, which is essentially all I do anymore.
 
 The following are my labor rates for my guys and myself, I don't do cash work as it leaves me and my employees vulnerable, should some accident occur.
 
 J. Docker  $45.00/hr.
 Paul $30.00/hr.
 Dyton $30.00/hr.
 Diaz $27.00/hr.
 
 I tack 15% on top of labor and materials, when presenting an invoice. I request payment for ongoing projects on a bi-weekly basis or upon completion of the work.
 
 If this meets with your approval, let me know so we can get together this weekend and go over your plan. As mentioned could probably start this project in about two weeks, and if its not to elaborate a plan could probably complete in about two weeks.
 
 Home/office tel: 785-3929
 
 Best Wishes,
 
 Jim Docker
