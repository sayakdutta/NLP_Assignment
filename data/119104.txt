 
 A spoon is a good start.  I think it's good as a cake frosting, as a filling between a couple of cookies, maybe spread on toast or even dissolved in coffee?  In Buenos Aires I remember it coming in a tiny little jar at breakfast along with the marmalade and honey -- goodness knows what they put it on.
 
  
     
 So tell me....Exactly how do I eat the dulce de lece?  With a spoon?  Do I put it on other things?  Mix it in anything?  I don't want to waste any of it experimenting............

 Had a great weekend and looking forward to next time.  Hope you made it
 back to town ok.  I had no problems but I think you should just assume
 that from the Newark airport it's at least 2.5 hours, probably a bit
 more.  The Avis lady didn't bat an eye; of course I stood towards the
 back of the car so she wasn't really looking at the front and there was
 a big line forming behind me so she was in a hurry.  Did the kids get
 away even close to on time?
 
 Thanks again!
