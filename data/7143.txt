 thoughts and support mean a lot to me.  How lucky I am to have you for a 
 sister and friend!  --Sally 
 
 
 
 

    
 
 Sally,
 
 Have been thinking quite a bit about the work news you told me.  We were
 talking about you last night with Mom and Dad.  You really have such a great
 gift--you must be able to be able to work so hard, focus so concretely, AND
 come up with creative solutions AND manage people.
 
 If I haven't said it recently, I am very proud of you!
 
 Love,
 
 Cindy
