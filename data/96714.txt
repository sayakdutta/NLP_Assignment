 Elizabeth/Paul:
 
 Please find attached my markup of the Draft Power Sale Agreement with New 
 Hampshire Electric Coop.  I have added some important language in Article 
 14.2 to reflect that Installed Capability will still be credited by ISO-NE 
 even during an outage at Seabrook (i.e., they should have full liability for 
 providing ICAP regardless of whether the plant is operating).  The rest of my 
 comments should be pretty clear.
 
 We need to have comments to NHEC by noon eastern time, Monday March 13th.  
 Please call me at 978-449-9936 to discuss.  Thanks much.
 
 John
