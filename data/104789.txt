 (1)  Yes, I did verbally approve the Merrill Lynch "Other Provisions" section 
 of the rate swap (10/26/00 deal).
 
 (2)  Yes, I received your Fax of 11/21/00 from Bank of Montreal with your 
 email to the bank.  The language which you sent to the Bank of Montreal 
 ("BOM") was to be based on the Merrill Lynch "Other Provisions" section of 
 the above rate swap.  In that regard,
  (i)  you inadvertently left out a phrase when you retyped the Merrill Lynch 
 language.  However, BOM's subsequent revision is acceptable.
  (ii)  it is not clear to me whether ALL of Paragraph 3 in the original BOM 
 confirm is being replaced.  Your message to BOM seems to imply that it is 
 fully 
         replaced (which is what we want).  You should definitely verify that 
 this is the case in your latest BOM confirm.
 
 (3)  Yes, the Termination Agreement format from Deutsche Bank AG looks fine.  
 Just be sure that all transaction references are correct.
 
 Sorry for the delay.  I am trying to identify another lawyer to back me up.

 Good Morning Sara,
 
 Hope you had a nice holiday weekend! I wanted to follow up regarding several 
 issues.
 
 1) Please provide me with your e-mail authorization wherein you verbally 
 approved the "Right to Terminate" language for the Merrill Lynch Interest 
 Rate Swap Confirmation.
 
 2) I faxed you Bank of Montreal's response to the "Right to Terminate" 
 language on Friday for the Interest Rate Swap that was originally traded on 
 11/3/00.. Please advise with your opinion. I have another trade with the 
 identical language from 11/14/00 that I am faxing to you this morning. We 
 received it at 5:37pm Friday afternoon.
 
 3) Please advise your opinion on the Termination Agreement for the Default 
 Swap with Deutsche Bank dated 10/12/00.
 
 Looking forward to your response.
 
 Regards,
 
 Jorge
