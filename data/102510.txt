 
 Mary, I finally was able to locate my copy of the Alternative Rates Policy 
 Statement and found the following language:
 
 "A pipeline may file the numbered tariff sheet implementing the negotiated 
 rate at the time it intends the rate to
    go into effect. The Commission does not intend to suspend the 
 effectiveness of negotiated rate filings or
    impose a refund obligation for those rates. For these reasons, the 
 Commission will readily grant requests to
    waive the 30 day notice requirement."
 
 I think it might be fair to interpret the first sentence such that it's OK to 
 file on the same day.  This reinforces my belief that 
 our waiver language is fine as is.
