 		  PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION
 
  Are you guys aware of this case?  Is this "the" antitrust case? It is filed 
 against both EES and Enron Power Marketing. Is it anything I can be of 
 assistance with?  Thanks.

 Greg:
 
 Thanks for the notice.  I believe this case belongs to another Enron
 affiliate and they are likely aware of it.  Just in case, I am forwarding
 this message to our Houston headquarters for their handling.  Please do not
 engage in any activity on this matter.  The selection of counsel will be
 controlled by the business unit attorney responsible for that affiliate.
 Thanks for your awareness of this filing.
 
 Regards,  David Lund

 David: Attached is a portion of the San Diego Superior Court webpage
 indicating new superior court filings. Padre Dam Municipal Water District,
 Valley Municipal Water District and the Sweetwater Authority filed suit
 against Enron and others for "antitrust/unfair business practices" on
 January 16, 2001. I will get a copy of the complaint so you can call me
 regarding specifics(I will not forward the complaint, thereby avoiding any
 argument that you have been "served"). I'll let you know when we obtain the
 complaint. Jeff and I will be ready to help if you need us, Mac
