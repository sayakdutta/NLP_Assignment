 One day in the Garden of Eden, Eve calls out to God.  "Father, I have a
 problem!"
 
  "What's the problem, Eve?"
 
  "Lord, I know you created me and provided this beautiful garden and
 all of  these wonderful animals and that hilarious comedic snake, but
 I'm
 just not  happy."
 
 "Why is that, Eve?" came the reply from above.
 
 "Lord, I am lonely, and I'm sick to death of apples."
 
 "Well Eve, in that case, I have a solution.  I shall create a man for
 you."
 
 "What's a man, Lord?"
 
 "This man will be a flawed creature, with many bad traits.  He'll lie,
 cheat and be vainglorious; all in all, he'll give you a hard time.
 But...he'll be bigger, faster, and will like to hunt and kill things.
 He will look silly when he's aroused, but since you've been complaining,
 I'll create him in such a way that he will satisfy your physical needs.
 He will be witless and will revel in childish things like fighting and
 kicking a ball about.  He  won't be too smart, so he'll also need your
 advice to think
 properly."
 
 "Sounds great." says Eve, with an ironically raised eyebrow. " What's
 the catch, Lord?"
 
 "Well...  you can have him on one condition."
 
 "What's that, Lord?"
 
 "As I said, he'll be proud, arrogant, and self-admiring...  So you'll
 have to let him believe that I made him first.  Just remember, it's our
 little secret... Y'know....Woman to woman..."
