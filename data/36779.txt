They did look pretty good, and could have really blown them out if Sims had been just a little more accurate in the second half.  But I'm not complaining.  I think Brown really made a mistake by going with Ivan Williams against OK.  He is just too slow hitting the hole against a defense like that.  I think the next three are locks.  Then it comes down to T+1.  I don't care how average they may be, UT has won exactly 1 game at Kyle since 1983 (8 games).  Texas should be very good next year.  The only problem area I see is the OL.  I just sent an email to Kyle about lunch.  Let's do it.
 
 ENE is a piece of shit.  That's really all there is to say about that.

 Did you go to the game this weekend?    UT looked strong after the first
 20min.  Hopefully Neb. and Tech can beat OU.  The A&M game looks like it
 could be more of a challenge than I had originally thought.    What's going
 on at Enron?  I saw where the SEC will be investigating an Enron
 partership.  What's your take on the situation there?
 
 Let's go to lunch soon.
