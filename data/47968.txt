 Bob and Corinna,
 Here are the versions of the MOU your lawyer will need to review.  As
 expected, some of the items just did not make the bar to warrant a
 change.  Specifically:
 an actual date for the released product will not go on the MOU.
 Customers who particpate in the JDP have a high degree of touch and
 disclosure with MS.  Although we are glad to discuss dates and they draw
 near with the customer we do not promise anything from the beginning
 (though this hardly matters now considering the date).
 The line in #4 that was cut and pasted to #17 has been placed back in
 #4.  This is due to the placement of the topic in #4.  The rest of #17,
 specifically stating that there is NO COST TO THE CUSTOMER has been left
 in on #17, and I'll probably incorporate this for future use.  It is a
 good addition.
 #10 on Microsoft's section has been removed.  It is clearly rednundant
 and not necessary.  We already say there is absolutely no cost to the
 customer.
 
 If this is agreeable (I have included the red lined version, so your
 lawyers can review), the final version with those changes have also been
 included.  Please print, sign and return.
 
 Thanks!
 JamMo!

 James - per our phone call this afternoon, I've revised the MOU.
 Attached is the redlined version as well as the final doc.  Please let
 me know if you have any questions.

 Susan,
 I would like to permanently modify our MOU to the following for our
 Joint Development Programs.  It is redlined, so you can review the exact
 changes.  This is actually from the customer, but I like what they
 changed and added, I just want to be certain that it's not going to come
 back and bite me later.  Roughly 4 or 5 sentenced.
 Thanks for you help!

 Hi, James.  I've attached a copy of the MOU which contains some minor
 changes suggested by one of our attorneys.  Let me know what you think.
 Thank you.
