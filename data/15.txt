 Hi Phillip.  We appreciate your prompt attention and completing the Team
 Selection information.
 
 Ideally, we needed to receive your team of raters on the Team Selection form
 we sent you.  The information needed is then easily transferred into the
 database directly from that Excel spreadsheet.  If you do not have the
 ability to complete that form, inserting what you listed below, we still
 require additional information.
 
 We need each person's email address.  Without the email address, we cannot
 email them their internet link and ID to provide feedback for you, nor can
 we send them an automatic reminder via email.  It would also be good to have
 each person's phone number, in the event we need to reach them.
 
 So, we do need to receive that complete TS Excel spreadsheet, or if you need
 to instead, provide the needed information via email.
 
 Thank you for your assistance Phillip.
