 
 Tina,
 
 In the future, if you have a message regarding John Lavorato's schedule, 
 could you please send it to me instead of sending it to John.  
 
 Also, you did not provide the time, however, Kay Chapman indicated that the 
 meeting will take place at 2:00 p.m.  John is not available at 2:00 p.m.
 
 Thank you
 
 Kim
