 It was Stewart Myers, head of the Financial Engineering Track. He did not 
 contact me directly, he contacted Josef (an MIT student that spent the summer 
 with Enron and received an offer to come to work with us).
 
 Josef wanted to know who could make the commitment of sponsoring (sending the 
 problem).

 Who was the professor who came up with the request?

 Vince,
 
 I have received a call from MIT asking if Enron would be interested in 
 sponsoring a Financial Engineering Pro-Seminar.
 
 This means that Enron would propose a problem that would have its solution 
 developed by students in the Financial Engineering Track. These students 
 would present the findings in the end. 
 
 I think that Enron has already sponsored a Financial Engineering Pro-Seminar. 
 I remember something about Real Options at the time I was at school.
 
 Please, let me know if Enron has the interest, specifically the Research. 
 
 Talking here at the Weather Desk, Mark Tawney expressed interest. If you 
 agree, we (the Weather Desk) could co-sponsor this Pro-Seminar with the 
 Research. The idea, then, would be to propose a problem connected to Weather 
 Trading.
 
 Please, give me your thoughts about this issue.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Claudio
