 
 Gentlemen,
 
 I'm attaching what we are calling an override letter to accompany the 
 breakout contracts.  This letter is intended to preserve the lender 
 requirements/accounting treatment from the WestLB agreement so long as the 
 equipment is a part of the financing package.
 
 I believe we also want to address an issue regarding assignment, but we are 
 still discussing Mike's version internally.
 
 Kent, I look forward to talking to you tomorrow at 300 CST.  If you would 
 like to discuss any of this in the am, please give me a call.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
