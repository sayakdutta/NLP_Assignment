 
 Melba,
 
 The description you sent to me yesterday seems a little confusing...How about 
 the following:
 
  Floating price A: Gas Daily midpoint for Henry Hub
  
  Floating price B: Gas Daily midpoint for __________
 
  Buyer pays Floating price A plus applicable basis, seller pays Floating 
 price B
 
 
 We should substitute your long description for "Gas Daily midpoint" above.  
 Run this by everyone ASAP so we can activate these products.
