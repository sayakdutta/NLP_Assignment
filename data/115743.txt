 
 I just added it. I don't know why, but I checked Jeff's Deal Blotter and he 
 had entered the broker. For some reason this did not transfer over into Deal 
 Entry. Sorry!

 481433 needs a broker
 
 
 
 

 
   
  
 First deal is 481433. Jeff Richter entered this awhile ago.
 
 Second deal is 481489. Sean Crandall forgot to put the broker in - he's 
 adding that right now.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate
