 Vince:
 
 As you requested, we mailed you a brochure about our upcoming course
 (2/22-4/4) in Houston.
 
 We are now following up with that mailing to identify remaining
 attendees for the session.  I wanted to make sure that we did not
 overlook anyone at Enron, so I am dropping you this email to see if you
 have anyone there in mind as an attendee.
 
 Best regards,
