 Brother Butcher and I are still in need of a final list of who's in and
 who's out for next weekend's Indian Guides camp-out at Brazos Bend state
 park.  Given the proximity of the park to our neighborhood (less than 1 hr
 away), most everyone (like me!) will be coming and going to meet other
 commitments back at home - SO THAT'S NO EXCUSE !!!
 
 To refresh your memories,  the itinerary for the weekend is get to the park
 Friday after school and set up before dark.  (For those who need to go down
 there later (Sat morning or afternoon) the location of our campsite will be
 at the entrance to the park.)  Once we get there, the activities are
 bicycle riding, touch football, fishing (bring your own gear) and boys
 playing grab-ass in general.  THE ONLY SCHEDULED EVENTS ARE A DINNER
 SATURDAY NIGHT,  A TRIP TO THE PARK'S OBSERVATORY SATURDAY NIGHT  AND
 BREAKFAST SUNDAY AM.  For food purposes, we need to know an accurate
 headcount for Saturday night and Sunday morning. If you need help getting
 your bikes to the park, get with Butch, he's looking into getting a trailer
 (or something).  We can settle-up on food, campsite rentals, lottery
 tickets, ... when we get there.  Maps for those who need them will be
 provided next week.
 
 Oh yes, this is real camping, as in tents, sleeping bags,
 flashlights,lanterns, etc.  Please feel free to bring snacks and drinks.
 Of course, this is all subject to weather cooperating.  We'll make the
 final call on that by Thursday.
