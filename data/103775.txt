 
 Can you supply with an addressee list for potential closure of ANY futures 
 accounts?  There are currently about seven inactive accounts for all types of 
 commodities.  Thanks.  Sara

 Yes, please keep me in mind during the audit process.
 We need to ensure that all traders and book admins that support them are 
 informed before any account closures,
 
 Thanks

 We are in the process of auditing/monitoring all accounts.  It is possible 
 that after due notice, we will commence with the closure of unutilized 
 account.s.  Please call if you have any questions.  Sara

 Hi Sara,
 
 I met with accounting regarding these amounts. I will be forwarding a copy to 
 you.
 
 We have a total of .77 cents remaining in our account with Cargill.
 
 Since we have several acounts in addition to Crude Oil, it is my 
 recommendation that
 we do not cancel the account as traders may want to utilize Cargill for other 
 commodities.
 
 Regards,
 David
 
 
     
 What were the dollar amounts on the printout that you sent to me?

 Cargill said that we do not have a line of credit nor do we have money 
 sitting in an account with them.
 The account is inactive at this time.
 
 Let's review our next step when you have an opportunity.
 Thanks
 David
