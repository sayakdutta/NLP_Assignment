 I have been authorized to open TVA to trade US power.  Accordingly, Tennessee 
 Valley Authority is authorized to trade US power via EnronOnline pursuant to 
 the on-line GTCs only.  Accordingly, TVA needs to receive an override letter 
 in the form attached below.
 
 Please call me with any questions or comments.

 Tana,
 
 Please let me know the status of Tennessee Valley Authority.  I understand 
 the power desk is working with them once again and would like TVA to have the 
 ability to trade on EnronOnline.  
 I would like have them open for all US East Power.
 
 Thanks for your assistance.
 
 T.
