 I forgot to mention to you yesterday that Don Schultz of Holland & Hart
 called late Friday and asked where we were in providing information so that
 he could bill the Joint Defense Group for the work done on the Kansas motion
 to dismiss.
 
 I told him that the bills had been assembled and would be sent to him
 shortly.  I don't know whether you have already sent the materials to
 Schultz.  If not, do you have everything that you need from me?
