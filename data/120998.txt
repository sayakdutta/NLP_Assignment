 
 Hello everyone, 
 
 Attached is a spreadsheet showing all fixed price deals that I have done with Pasadena as well as my term sheet for February and March.  I am working with Patti and Anne Bike to make sure things are in the system as best they can be.  Please let me know if you have any questions and I will be glad to help you as much as I can.  I am out of the office until Monday.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kim Ward
