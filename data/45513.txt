 Does this apply only to the North American contracts and weather trades for 
 which you are responsible?  
 Does the instruction below apply to Australia and Japan ISDA's?
 
 
 
 

   
 Per my conversations with Mark Taylor, we should continue to put any weather 
 trades done online under any relevant master agreement with the 
 counterparty.  Further, there is no prohibition against doing a trade online 
 with a counterparty when we do not have a master in place.  Any non-master 
 trades would go under the respective GTC.  It appears to be only a 
 coincidence that we are trading online only with counterparties we have 
 masters in place with.
