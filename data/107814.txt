 There is a new virus - WOBBLER. It  will arrive on e-mail titled CALIFORNIA.
 ?
 IBM and AOL have announced that it  is very powerful, more so than 
 Melissa,there is no remedy. It will eat all your  information on the hard 
 drive and also destroys Netscape Navigator and Microsoft  Internet Explorer. 
 Do not open anything with this title. Not many people seem to  know about 
 this yet so propagate it as fast as possible.
 
 If you receive  an e-mail titled "Win A. Holiday" DO NOT open it. It will 
 erase everything on  your hard drive. Forward this letter out to as many 
 people as you can. This is a  new, very malicious virus and not many people 
 know about it. This information  was announced from Microsoft.
 
 DO NOT OPEN "PRETTY PARK." It is a virus  that will erase your whole "C" 
 drive. It will come to you in the form of an  e-mail from a familiar person. 
 I repeat, DO NOT OPEN. DELETE RIGHT AWAY. It gets  into your address book.
 
 Forward this to everyone in your address book. I  would rather receive this 
 warning 25 times than not receive it  once!
 ?

 David N.  Miles
