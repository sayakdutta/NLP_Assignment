 
 A "Doorstep" inspection of this business was performed in accordance with our 
 procedures and apparently this business is a disaster!!! We need immediate 
 action on this up to and including shutting it down. This was the worst we 
 have seen at Enron and I don't even want to put in this email what I heard 
 was going on there. 
 
 We need a coordinated solution here asap to avoid a real disaster, if there 
 isn't one already. I'll speak with Rick Causey here about what immediate 
 action we should take but the more you guys can dig into this the better. 
 More to come.
 
 Rick
