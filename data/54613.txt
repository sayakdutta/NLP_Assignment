 
 Tani,
 
 No problem. We shall look at the curve on Monday. I have organized a  small 
 team to examine
 the curve from different perspectives.
 
 Curve validation is normally a RAC prerogative and I shall get them involved 
 on Monday

 Following Steve's note to you earlier today, I wanted to mention that we have 
 a fairly urgent need for review of the copper curve in particular, as there 
 is a deal due for final pricing in the next few days.
 
 I am not sure what data you have received from Enron Metals in London, so I 
 am asking Tim Poullain-Patterson to ensure that you have the curves and the 
 economic justification proposed as soon as possible.  Please direct any 
 questions to him or to Harry Tefoglou.  I will be in the Tokyo office next 
 week, but available via e-mail.
 
 Thanks in advance for your assistance,
 
 Tani
