 Jim,
 
 I have been asked by the management of Mariner to seek your approval of
 Mariner's retention of John E. Graykowski, a partner at Dyer Ellis & Joseph
 in D.C., for an upcoming project finance matter.  Until recently, John was
 the Deputy Maritime Administrator (MARAD)responsible for implementing the
 National Shipbuilding Initiative, with particular emphasis on the Title XI
 Loan Guarantee Program. The project Mariner wants to utilize John for is the
 potential financing, through bonds guaranteed by MARAD, of the construction
 of a $50-60MM portable deepwater production facility. Given his ties with
 MARAD, John is uniquely qualified for this project, but I want to make sure
 you have no conflict issues or other concerns with John or his firm.
 
 If you would like more information on John or Dyer Ellis, or you have any
 other questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.
 
 I look forward to hearing from you.
 
 
 Regards,
 Kelly Zelikovitz
