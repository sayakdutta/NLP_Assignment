 be any weeding?  Unfortunately we can't stop by on the way up, but likely on 
 the way back, which may be Saturday night.  If so, do you guys wan't to play 
 golf on Sunday morning?  (Prentice is leaving with her pals today, and I'm 
 heading up sometime tomorrow.)
 
 Dinner was exactly $50/person.  Thanks for bringing the wine----my shirt 
 loved it.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Just in from watering the west 40.  I think this is going to be our best
 year ever - lookin' good, lookin' good.  However, there is some serious
 weeding that someone needs to do!!!
 
 I am presuming you guys are stopping in Napa before your dome trek (which is
 why I thought I could give you a check immediately!).  Is that the case?  If
 so, I hope you can join us in a nummy little repast!  If not, I will put a
 check in the mail when you let me know the amount.  Unlike some, I always
 carry my checkbook with me!
 
 Those were incredibly beautiful knives that you guys gave Cameron!
