 
 The Confirms group in Houston has asked me to obtain a copy of the 
 confirmation letter you come up with for this deal. This group is responsible 
 for keeping records of all confirmation letters, whether or not they execute 
 them. So this includes term deals that are marked "no confirm." Please let me 
 know if this is okay with you.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate
