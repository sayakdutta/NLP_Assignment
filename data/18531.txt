 
 The dinner was incredibly delicious.  Thank you very much.  I apologize for 
 being so late--increasingly I have less and less control over my schedule.  
 Would have much preferred to have spent it with you guys.  And sorry that I 
 pooped out so early---I'm running on zero sleep and had a 7:30 conference 
 call this morning.
 
 That said, the dinner was really extraordinary.  You guys outdid yourself.  
 Made an others tough day very nice.  Thanks.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
