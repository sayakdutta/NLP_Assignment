 Dear Mike,
 
 We have renewed the following subscriptions in your name: 
  Fortune
  Wall Street Journal
 This is the last time that eSource will process renewals for Fortune.  In the 
 future all renewal reminders and invoices will come directly to you. 
 ** Please send me your Company and six digit Cost Center (RC) numbers so that 
 we will have them on file when the publisher bills us for the subscriptions.
 Let us know if you have any questions.
 Thank you,
 Stephanie E. Taylor
