 
 Please note that because this event of force majeure is at the plant, and not on the pipe, it does not qualify as an event of force majeure under our contract.  Any deals we have that are not done under a Enron contract will probably have force majeure applied to them.
 
 Please endeavor to find commercially reasonable terms to work around this problem regardless of who's contract the deal was done under.
 
 Regards,
