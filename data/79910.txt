 Just wanted to let you guys know, that while on a family vacation last week
 in Red River, New Mexico, the youngest sister on John & David Denner was
 killed while driving one of those 4-wheel motor bikes. I guess John had to
 hold on to her lifeless body for about an hour until help could reach the
 spot on the mountain where she had the accident. I spoke to John on Saturday,
 and at that point he seemed to be handling it well. The funeral is tomorrow.
