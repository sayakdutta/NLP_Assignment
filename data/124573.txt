 Jay - I tried pulling the confirms up on both of these deals this morning in DCAF, and I get a message saying there was no confirm.  The notes to both deals state that you are working on the confirm.  Have these deals been confirmed yet?  Also, if they have, can you get me a copy?  If they could be faxed to 713-646-8420 it would be great.
 
 I addition, on a regular basis, Lisa Valderrama and Pam Boxx need to be copied on any Emails like this.  That way if one of us is out of the office, the others will be able to make sure the invoice/payments take place on time.  
 
 If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.
