 
 Do these two e-mails relate to the same litigation I sent to you?

 Jeff,
 
 I attach an affidavit in support of MG's claim against Base Metal Trading Ltd 
 to release an escrow order over aluminium cargoes held in the Port of 
 Baltimore - this also gives a brief description of the facts.
 
 In short, Base Metal Trading have obtained an attachment order in respect of 
 the goods; however, MG is claiming that title to the goods is vested in MG.  
 I will send you separately other correspondence, and will keep you posted as 
 to progress.
 
 Regards
 
 Justin
