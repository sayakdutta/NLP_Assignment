 
 7:00 pm is fine and I knew you still had a thing for David.

 Very good.  I am very proud of your e-mail.  I was laughing but was very
 impressed by it.  I think I should get those often.
 
 How about I come by and pick you up this evening.  How does 7:00 sound?  Will
 that be enough time for you to leave work and get home and change into your
 leather Rockies?  By the way, I am not wearing those tonight.  I have decided
 to break you into the cowboy scene slowly.  Instead, I will be wearing my
 wranglers.  We will save the Rockies for when David is around!  I actually
 believe that I will be wearing those Thursday night.  That way, you won't be
 slapping me on the behind in the suite and trying to embarrass me.
 
 Let me know about the time and I will see you this evening.
