 Tammy Shepperd and myself have been asked to maintain the status of Enron's 
 turbine position.  This list includes the 24 LM6000s, all other ENA turbines 
 and all Enron turbines to the extent information is available.  The file 
 includes 3 worksheets:
 
 Turbine Inventory:  lists the turbine, delivery, ownership, project 
 commitment and other related items.
 LM6000 Status:  includes delivery, configuration, project commitment and 
 other related items.
 LM6000 Assign:  less detailed schedule with the delivery, project commitment 
 and current availability.
 
 In the future, to maintain the integrity of this information, the file will 
 NOT be emailed, but will accessible from the following location in a Read 
 Only format:
 
 O:\NAES\Master Turbine Listing.xls
 
 It is our view that requiring users to access the actual directory will be 
 the most efficient method of assuring the user is receiving up-to-date 
 information.  As project needs arise or change, please email or contact Tammy 
 Shepperd at (713) 853-6589 or myself at (713) 853-3526.  In addition, if 
 there is other information that would be useful, let us know.
 
 Thanks,
 Mathew Gimble
