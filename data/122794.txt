 
 Doug,
 
 This note is just to confirm my voicemail message this morning  indicating 
 that the charges for the Fuel Oil sample check for vanadium should be charged 
 to Co# 0413, RC # 106230.  According to the spec sheet I have, the ASTM 
 method for vanadium is D3605 and the units of measurement are ppm (wt).
 
 Again, I appreciate your patience in this frustrating issue.
 
 
 Charlie
