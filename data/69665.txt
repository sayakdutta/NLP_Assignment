 
 What weekend?  I will be in San Antonio, TX from 10/12-10/15.  So if it's this weekend I'll be out of town.  But, if not let's party!
 
 

    
 
 I will be coming in next week for the Texas A&M/CU game.  Are you up for
 going to it??  THere is a group of us that get together for the game and
 party afterwards.
