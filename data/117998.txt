 Let me know what time in the afternoon works out well for you and I will pay 
 you guys a quick visit.
 
 
 
    
  
 I'll be out the 26th but in the 27th - the afternoon would probably be better 
 for me since it will be my first day back after vacation.

 Mark and Brent;
 
 I will be in Houston on March 26 and 27 (returning to Brazil on the 28th).  
 If you think it would be appropriate to discuss any of the EOL-Brazilissues, 
 please let me know if you will be available in any of these days.
 
 Rgds,
 
 Sami
