 
 Paul,
 
 Can you give me more information about  your computer skills?
 
 My group is very hands-on oriented and  computer programming is a critical
 skill.

 Dear Vince:
 
 In following up on my voicemail message today, I attach my resume below for
 your review and consideration.
 
 It's ironic that you called while I was putting the message together.  I
 will keep it short and look forward to speaking to you at your convenience.
 
 Best regards,
 
 Paul
