 
 In response to your inquiry, Transwestern would first like to clear up the 
 terminology being used here.  As you know, currently SoCalGas doesn't assign 
 "primary rights" to deliveries off of any interconnecting pipeline.  The 
 establishment of tradeable rights for intrastate capacity is among the issues 
 currently under consideration in the GIR proceeding.   However, if what you 
 are asking about is what has been the historical or otherwise available 
 receipt capacity for Transwestern deliveries at North Needles, then let me 
 offer the following. 
 
 Transwestern has always operated on the premise that SoCalGas could 
 physically accept up to a maximum of 750 MMcf/d at its North Needles receipt 
 point.  Consequently, Transwestern has sold firm transportation to its 
 interstate customers for west flow deliveries to North Needles not to exceed 
 the 750 MMcf/d limitation.  Our west flow mainline capacity is 1.09 Bcf/d.

      Do Transwestern shippers to Transwestern's North Needles delivery
 point have 1090 MMcfd of primary rights into ScCalGas, 750 of primary
 rights. or some other number?
