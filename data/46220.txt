 Tana, 
 
 The counterparties below are about to be approved in Credit. It would be 
 great to get your Legal response before you leave for
 vacation.  We can then minimize approvals that go through Mark Taylor next 
 week.  
 
 Thanks,
 Camille

 I'm waiting on Tom to review my credit recommendations for the counterparties
