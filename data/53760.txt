 1) I agree with paragraphs 1 and 2 in Winton's document (re-running jumps and clustering and correlations of jumps).
 
 2) Regarding 3 (fixing instability in volatilities) I would suggest implementing volatilities smoothing (see short document attached)
  
 3) Also: regarding correlations. The analysis I did was showing that correlations on fixed contracts prices are much more
 consistent, have less noise versus prompt, promt+1, etc prices correlations (remember those pictures?). I was suggesting
 to switch to those. IT implemented this in some version a while ago, but since they don't use version control environment properly
 I am not sure they still have it. This will allow us to capture also the correlations across gas and power (I experimented with NG-R6 correlations) at least for 2 prompt years. 
 
 4) We need to ask IT to increase the number of columns in the database table which holds factors from 7 to 100. Then we (Research)
 can experiment with joint factor analysis to capture term-structure of correlations across curves.
