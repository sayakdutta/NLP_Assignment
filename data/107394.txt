 We are opening up an account with Fimat Canada in the name of Enron North America.  Legal is currently working on getting the execution and clearing account opened.  
 This was part of the initiative last Thursday to move futures accounts to beneficial Futures clearers.
 
 In the meantime,  Fimat Canada is requesting that we get an Give-up agreement in place with clearing going to BMO Nesbitt Burns.
 We are okay with this. 
 
 They would like to get the give up signed today.  They say it is the standard format.
 Jean-Pierre at Fimat is the contact for any questions.
 
 Please call me if I can be of assistance.
 
 Thanks, Sheila
  

  
 
 
 Sheila,
 
 We have not got yet the authorization from the Fimat Group risk department
 to open a clearing account for Enron at Fimat Derivatives Canada.  I will
 send you the required schedules once I get this authorization.
 
 In the meantime, for your transactions on the Montreal Exchange, Fimat
 Canada will execute them and give-up the clearing to BMO Nesbitt Burns.
 For this purpose, we need to have a give-up agreement in place.
 
 Attached is a give-up agreement.
 
 (See attached file: giveup_ENRONNESBITT.doc)
 
 Please have this agreement signed in three copies and send them to my
 attention at 1501, McGill College, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3A 3M8.
 
 Also, please fax me a copy this afternoon ASAP at 514-841-6217.

 We need an commission schedule and interest rate schedule.
 Please forward this request to the appropriate parties.
