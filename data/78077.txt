 
 Here's the latest version.  It looks ok to me.  The most substantive aspect 
 of it is that Calumet Power (or its affiliate) could end up the indemnity 
 obligations under the agreement.  (in other words, an entity without a lot of 
 money to fund indemnity obligations)  In my opinion this isn't important in 
 the context of the option.
 
 Unless someone objects, I'll tell PERC that Enron is ready to go with the 
 assignment.
