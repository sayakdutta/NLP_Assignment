 Thank you for your very quick reply.  There will only be two of us and we 
 would like to come to see the boat but unfortunately we will not have time to 
 spend the day sailing.  We will be staying in St. Tropez at Residence de la 
 Pinede (33)04 94 55 91 00.
 
 Regards,
 
 Mark Taylor

 Dear Sir,
 
 Thank you for your email and for your interest. We do have a location in
 HySres, in southern France, with a Super Maramu 2000 available for
 inspection and sail trials. If you want, you can make a visit of the boat
 or even test her at sea on Monday, 25th September. Please tell us how many
 people will come with you and confirm whether you wish a detailed visit of
 the Super Maramu 2000 or if you want to spend a whole day sailing aboard.
 
 Looking forward to hearing from you,
 
 Best regards,
 
 
 Renaud BARATHON
