 
 Thanks, Delaney.  See you on Friday.  
 
 Quick comment:  Though just about everything's uncertain these days, folks 
 seem to think that Legislators are likely to get very active just as soon as 
 they arrive in Sacramento (next week?).  Seems that a key--if not 
 dominant--part of the agenda ought to be how this group can (quickly) come to 
 agreement on a comprehensive solution that it can offer to the Legislature 
 and the Governor as a pragmatic and positive way out.  Sure you folks are 
 very focused on this, but it struck me that the agenda looks pretty ambitious 
 for a 3-hour meeting.  In any case, just a thought that I wanted to share.  
 
 Thanks and can't thank you enough for all your efforts.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
