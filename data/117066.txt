 
 If the NDA is the Confidentiality Agreement for the Energy Trading Platform 
 (group of six?), I have marked it up with only those revisions I thought 
 essential (having discussed them with Andy) and am now waiting to hear back 
 regarding where I should send it (have left voice mail for Greg and Andy is 
 checking).
 
 If the NDA is something else, please let me know.
