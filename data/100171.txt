 I finally received the replacement pages for the Centana Stg Contract.  The Storage Contract and Firm & Interruptible Transport Contracts should be delivered to you sometime today.  Please review and initial if everything is OK.  Can I just sign after your approval or do I need to obtain someone else's approval?  Please let me know.
 
 	Thanks,
