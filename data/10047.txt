 I went to the eye doctor this morning and my left eye is looking great, better than he expected.  Since I am able to see 20/30 he decided to forego the temporary contact on my right eye and proceed with the surgery on the right eye.  He has scheduled me to have the Lasik surgery on my right eye this Friday, the 19th.  
 
 If this causes a coverage problem, Robert has volunteered to come in early.  If there are any concerns please let me know.
