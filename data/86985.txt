 
 Dear Mr. Junek-
 
 Per Scott Goodell's advice, I am officially informing you that the CES 
 offshore firm contract is now on your book.  Scott thinks that it is 
 volumetric, so there should be no impact on you.  The wellhead desk will take 
 this over as soon as their pools are set up on Col. Gulf.
 
 Sincerely yours,
 
 Susan (aka "the bitch")
