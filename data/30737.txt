 There's a lot going on!  We want to update you, and we want to invite you t=
 o view a pilot of a financial data warehouse.  The pilot shows cost reporti=
 ng using a small sample of real data (see below for more description).  Her=
 e's the schedule to view the pilot.  Please contact Jennifer Reed at x39406=
  to RSVP, so we'll know if we need to schedule more sessions.

 We've mapped out a strategy in each of these areas, set deliverables and ex=
 pect to accomplish a lot while our BU reps are with us from Feb. 20th to 28=
 th.
 
 Data Warehouse Project Update
 
 The cost reporting pilot has been built by Beverly Fennessy and the technic=
 al team based on the design Li Chan has specified based on your input from =
 the initial interviews, followups and several cost reporting workshops she =
 has sponsored in the last month.
 
 The pilot will be a mini-cost reporting button, using a small subset of act=
 ual financial data from SAP-CO (one BU, three months of data), and showing =
 only the cost center information (not project info).  It is designed to tes=
 t this solution's (Acta/Oracle/Business Objects) ability to:
 
 1.=09extract data from SAP using Acta,
 2.=09report data using a team structure,
 3.=09develop usable, presentable and technically efficient "canned reports,=
 " and
 4.=09provide users an ad-hoc query tool for reporting and analysis not cove=
 red by canned reports.
 
 The BU reps need to become familiar with the pilot, and all of our intervie=
 w participants are invited to see the pilot and evaluate the tool.
 We'll have a questionnaire for your comments and suggestions, which we will=
  incorporate into the development of the actual cost reporting button.  The=
 re's a distribution list at the end of this memo - if you know of someone i=
 n your group who should attend, please invite them.
 
  Assuming no significant changes are identified in the user review of the p=
 ilot, we expect at least a portion of the cost reporting from the data ware=
 house to be rolled into production by the end of April.  So be sure to voic=
 e your input!
 
 The second part of the warehouse will be cash reporting.  Steve Frazier is =
 the BU rep leading this effort, with Mike Deville from Corp Reporting and S=
 usan Bellinghausen from the ISC providing input.  We are working on both di=
 rect and indirect cash flow (historical) and trying to determine the best w=
 ay to source the data.  We'd like to get it from SAP since that's where we =
 can get the most detail, with the Treasury workstation as the source for ma=
 nual wires not yet input into SAP.  However, Susan's group has told us that=
  the current SAP design won't allow us to use the Cash Budget Management mo=
 dule since that information doesn't tie to FI (due to differences in value =
 date and posting date).  Therefore, we're looking at what SAP design change=
 s might be needed.
 
 The next step will be earnings, which will expand cost reporting by bringin=
 g in gross margin, other income, interest expense, minority interest and ta=
 xes.  We're hoping to be able to tie into the Energy Ops Project Enlighten =
 (data warehouse) as a source of gross margin data for wholesale operations.
 
 We envision that the counterparty reporting button will also interface with=
  other Enron warehousing efforts, such as Global Counterparty.
 
 A significant objective of the warehouse is to provide ad hoc reporting, so=
  we will be looking at the data behind the reporting buttons and determinin=
 g which other information should be transferred into the warehouse in the e=
 arly phases.  Our strategy is to place only the information that is most re=
 quested into the warehouse in the early phases, but to design the warehouse=
  to be flexible enough to allow additional fields to be transferred in over=
  time.
 
 Budgeting and Forecasting Tool
 
 In our interviews, many people expressed an interest in an automated planni=
 ng tool.  We have looked at three products - SAP's SEM, Hyperion's Planning=
  and Adaytum's ePlanning. Some of you attended a demo of Adaytum last week.=
  We like because it seems to have the most functionality and  two Enron BUs=
  already use it (Europe and EBS).  We want to be able to plan for earnings =
 as well as cash forecasting and projected balance sheets, with these number=
 s feeding the warehouse so that our reporting could include both actuals an=
 d plan or forecast.  We'd like to hear any thoughts you have on how you thi=
 nk your BU would use a tool such as this.
 
 We're evaluating the valuation proposition now and expect to can make a rec=
 ommendation at Rick's February 27 staff meeting. =20
 
 Susan Helton and James Weitekamp are working on this effort.
 
 Close Process
 
 Howard Selzer is leading the initiative to shorten the close process.  He i=
 s gathering close calendars from each BU and is talking with each group abo=
 ut possible opportunities to squeeze time out of the schedule.  He will als=
 o focus on topside entries (after the 8th workday) to determine how to elim=
 inate the need for these entries.  Glenn Kobes will provide the tax perspec=
 tive.
 
 Knowledge Sharing
 
 Joe Darensbourg is preparing a plan to share best practices among groups.  =
 He is also spearheading the Global Accounting Intranet site, which is one o=
 f the media we can use.  A Web Advisory Team has been formed so that each B=
 U will have input into how we can best communicate using this site (still w=
 aiting for ETS and Europe to appoint representatives to this team).  Ideas =
 for knowledge sharing include soliciting tips to be reviewed by the Web Adv=
 isory Team and then posted to the intranet site, forming user groups in coo=
 peration with the ISC (ETS has groups already in place), setting up a forum=
  to ask questions of other users (either as part of eThink or separately) a=
 nd encouraging participation in the Houston ASUG (SAP user group).  We'll w=
 ant to coordinate with the ISC's efforts to avoid duplication (they have FA=
 Qs on their web site).
 
 Alternate Hierarchies
 
 Caroline Lothian is working to compare and document how the each BU uses al=
 ternate hierarchies for reporting. This specifically addresses team reporti=
 ng, but also includes anything other than the legal rollup.  A common desig=
 n for team report hierarchies is necessary to build canned reports in the d=
 ata warehouse, since we expect you will want to include data at drill-down =
 levels such as BU, line of business, team, profit center and cost center. B=
 eyond a team hierarchy, we're really looking to share best practices rather=
  than build a common standard.
 
 Number of Entities and Cost Objects
 
 Currently we have about 1,900 legal or accounting entities and nearly 200,0=
 00 cost objects in SAP.  As far as we know, this is the largest number amon=
 g all of SAP's customers.  We want to be proactive in controlling these num=
 bers before they have the possibility of bringing our systems to their knee=
 s.  In addition, the large number of entities and cost objects result in ex=
 tra costs related to tax compliance and accounting maintenance, as well as =
 the intangible costs related to higher complexity.  Jill Erwin is heading a=
 n initiative to first find out how the BUs use various cost objects and whe=
 ther there may be a way to simplify their use, and then to identify ways to=
  ensure that new entities and cost objects are set up only when that is the=
  best way to accomplish Enron's objectives.
 
 Training and Change Management
 
 In our interviews, we heard about some problems that may be able to be reso=
 lved through specific training.  We will also need training on the new tool=
 s and initiatives that will be implemented in Project Sunrise.  It is also =
 important for us to continue to communicate with various accounting groups =
 as to what Project Sunrise is doing so that we can ensure that we provide w=
 hat users really need.  Madeline Chan and Dave McEllin are taking the lead =
 on what approach we should take on training.  We have also spoken with the =
 Change Management team in the ISC (under Andy Lawrence), who has agreed to =
 provide direction and resources as well as help ensure that together we are=
  providing seamless service to our users.
 =20
 Other Issues
 
 Other areas that we intend to address in Project Sunrise include the automa=
 tion of buckets and e-schedules, balance sheets by profit center, intercomp=
 any issues and foreign currency issues.  In addition, we working with Susan=
  Bellinghausen and Rick Boehm (ISC) to provide better reporting related to =
 payroll distribution and labor distribution.
 
 As you can see, this is a very broad project, and we want to be sure each B=
 U is properly represented.  If you'd like to offer additional resources to =
 Sunrise, either in general or related to a specific initiative, please call=
  Mark at x57193 or Jan at x33260.  Attached is the mailing list.
