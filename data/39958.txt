 Hello Mark -- Andrei Postelnicu, Financial Times, will contact you regarding
 the electronic trading article.  For reference, his number is 212-641-6339.
 
 Mark, in cases where we receive similar requests in the future, may I put
 reporters in contact with you directly? (with the understanding that,
 depending upon the issue, you may or may not decide to speak with them) 
 
 Also, feel free to let me know if you would like any of the ISDA staff to
 join your call with Andrei. Many thanks -- Stacy  
 
 
     
 
 
 Yes, I would be happy to.   Mark Haedicke

                     12:11 PM              Article on Electronic Trading                
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 The FT has contacted ISDA regarding our contribution to an upcoming article
 they are writing on the emergence of electronic trading.
 
 ISDA staff will give them regulatory background in US and Europe.  I
 thought
 it might be worthwhile for them to hear a business/legal perspective as
 well.
 
 Would you be interested in speaking with the reporter within the next
 couple
 of days?  Please advise.  Many thanks!
