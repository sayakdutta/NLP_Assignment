 
 Alan Aronowitz is working on a presentation he has to give in Singapore on 
 Global Energy Derivatives, and wanted to put a little blurb in of some kind 
 about weather.  He wanted to see if he could get a copy of the presentation 
 you and Mike Corbally gave at the ISDA seminar to see if there were any 
 slides that might be helpful for his presentation.  Do you have a copy I can 
 provide him?  Thanks!
