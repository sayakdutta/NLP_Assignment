 BRant,
 
 I got a call from my contact at Exxon regarding the PG your working on.  
 Vicki Brown needs the paprework as soon as possible, they only have 2 days of 
 credit left with us and we're buying some day gas from them.
 
 
 Let me know the status or if I can help
 
 
 Thanks
 
 
 Greg Schockling
