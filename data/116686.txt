 
 We show peak both in Enpower and in Mike's trade log. I'll check with Mike in 
 the morning - but in his log he has off-peak circled - that could either mean 
 he was questioning it or he was absolutely sure about it - we'll find out 
 though!
 
 Thanks,
 Kate

 Kate this trade is from yesterday.
 
 Prebon sent over a confirm for off-peak hours and then sent a revision to 
 peak hours.  Which one is it?
