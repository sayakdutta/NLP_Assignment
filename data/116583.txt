 
 Sharen had already alerted me to the first deal, which I changed, but not the 
 second. That deal has been changed as well now.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate

 Hi Kate,
 
 I spoke with Jeff Richter this morning and the index sleeve he did on 
 yesterday with EES (deal 533084) and Sempra(deal 533085) is incorrect in 
 Enpower.  He said he would change the publication code to reflect Dow Jones 
 SP-15 Peak instead of Dow Jones NP-15 Peak on both of these deals.
 
 Can you please check with Jeff to see what the status is on these changes. 
 The EES deal has been changed. The Sempra deal has not been changed.
 
 Thanks!!
