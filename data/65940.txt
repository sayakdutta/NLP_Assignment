       yeah you'd have to get some neon pink button ups and black pants
 
       
                             
 
       i just want to meet some models down there.  i don't hang out at
    discos
       thought, but if i was in miami i guess i would.  i think i would need
       some
       new clothes b/c all i wear is polos and khakis.

          nobody speaks english, dirty, high crime rate.  We'll probably be
    at
       a
          resort though so it won't matter.  If you like the big discoteque
       dance
          clubs then it's your place, which I'll bet you do.  I'd rather lay
       back
          in
          the caymans, and I've never been there.  I'm getting old I think.
 
          
                                         
 
          does miami suck?  i haven't ever been there.  i have been to
    caymans
       and
          they are awesome.  it is really laid back and very expensive.
    either
          place
          will be fun, i just think miami  will be a better night life.

             I'd rather go to the caymans personally.  Miami sucks.
 
             

                                        
 
             she called me.  she keeps in touch with me.  she spilled the
    beans
       on
             the
             plans to move the wedding.  i think if we went to cayman we
    would
          spend
             over a grand each.    miami will rock.
