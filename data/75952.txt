 The original contract covered 24 LM6000 turbines.  The "break-out contracts" 
 cover the turbines going to specific projects.  There is a provision in the 
 original LM6000 contract which contemplates "facility agreements" covering 
 one or more of the LM6000 turbines.  We call them "break out contracts" as a 
 short-hand reference.

 Thanks for the documents.   I understand that these are final.  Why is there 
 a South America Facility and a ESAT Break out Contract?  Aren't they the same?
