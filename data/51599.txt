 Stinson,
 
 I have accepted an amended offer from Southern Company Energy
 Marketing.  My decision was based on the higher compensation, and the
 opportunity to rotate through structuring, trading and research.  I am
 very confident that I would have been very engaged and happy working in
 your group; I did not take the decision lightly.
 
 I'll be moving to Atlanta in March, but I will keep the email and URL
 given below.  I'd like to stay in touch, and I expect to see you at
 conferences.  Also, please pass my regards on to Vince and Mike.
