 
 No foreced drinking, just one ceremonial shot of tequilla.  I think they're saving it up for this weekend.  I think we're having a party on Saturday.  I don't know if we have any closet shelves that I can fit into, though.....
 
 
     
 
 Did people try and force glasses of alcohol on you just because it's your
 birthday?  That is always nice.  Sometimes it seems like other people are
 way more excited that it's your birthday than you are, and they just really
 want you to party.  I don't know, I am rambling.  I was up kind of late and
 so this morning I am a little slow.  
 
 
     
 
 More like 50 cents.....Canadian that is.
 
 
     
 
 Hi there,
 
 How are you feeling?  Like a million dollars or more like .50 cents?
