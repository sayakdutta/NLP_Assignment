 
 I forwarded a guy down to Credit on 5/9/01 from the referenced counterparty 
 who wanted to get an ISDA in place with us.  I told him he would have to 
 speak to our Credit Dept. first, and from the tone of his voicemail it 
 doesn't sound like he's heard from anyone.  Can you make sure that someone 
 calls him so he doesn't call me again.  His name is Greg Bass and his no. is 
 619/696-3177.  Thanks.
