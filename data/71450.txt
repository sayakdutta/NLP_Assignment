 
 This is the contract that we said would be the jumping off point (an accurate 
 description) for our GE discussions.  As I recall, we need to give it the off 
 balance sheet treatment before it is distributed to the masses. Rose, can you 
 take responsibility for the basic OBS stuff?  I suggest we discuss assignment 
 and indemnity separately (and soon).
 
 My assistant is setting up the legal team's conference call for Wednesday at 
 830.  Details to follow.
