 Terri, I apologize for being late on the term sheet.  Vacations have been
 impeding my schedule.  I plan to send it to you today.   Thanks.

 Dwight,
 
 I wanted to get an update from you on the status of your RFP process.
 In our former discussion, you had indicated that we were short-listed
 and that I would be receiving some additional information as far as next
 steps.  I understood that the second phase would be happening within a
 couple of weeks.  I just wanted to see where you were in your process at
 this point.  Thanks.
