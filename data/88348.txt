 
 In preparing for our meeting with Exxon, I have hit a dead end with regards 
 to the "Agreement"  he cites in his fax to us.  I have searched and others as 
 well to no avail.    Therefore,  would you ask Jacobson to fax  you/me  the 
 entire agreement he is referring too because it does not exist in our world.  
 
 Thanks!
