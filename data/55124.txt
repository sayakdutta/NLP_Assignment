 I believe this will be helpful in your analysis.

 I have got CSFB working on the amendment you asked for.
 
 In the meantime we have produced a graph which shows, as indices, market 
 values of the water companies and the RAB of the industry since 
 privatisation.  The following points come out
 1 Market values overtime have been 1.1x RAB
 2 The result is significantly skewed by the period between Mid 1997 and end 
 1998 when the ratio was c1.5x.
 3 The premium to RAB is only found at a time when political uncertainty has 
 been removed the companies are able to outperform the regulatory deal 
 significantly.  Those days are gone - a fact witnessed by the decline in 
 share prices in the last year
 
 Just to note that the graph we have produced here is a weighted average of 
 water companies - whereas the figures we did yesterday on the RAB market 
 value ratio is a straight average.  Obviously that influences the numbers a 
 little.
 
 On CustomerCo.  CSFB have contacted around 7 energy companies.  The result 
 has been positive and they are prepared to enter our journal exercise.  I 
 await a revised fee proposal but CSFB have been advised that it should be 
 more modest than the last one !
