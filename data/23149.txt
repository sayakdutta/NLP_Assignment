 
 I believe the committee has earned the right by its work to select the name. Jim
 
  
     
 any preference?
 
  
     
 We really need to get an official name for the Portal. The finalists are:  
 
 Enron Legal Edge 
 Enron Legal Net
 Enron Legal Source
 EnLaw
 Enron Legal Ease (copyright issues?) 
 
 Who is going to pick this...Mr. Derrick, the GC's or the committee? 
 
 I understand that you will only have a few introductory comments on the Portal rather than a 15 minute presentation. I will be meeting with you Thursday, and we can talk about what type of slides I can prepare for you to go along with your comments. We will have a Portal Demo outside the ballroom where the participants can see the demo and be provided with information on the categories. We have a new graphic design for the Portal Header which you can see below. Let me know your thoughts?
