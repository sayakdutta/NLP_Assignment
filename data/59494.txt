 Can we also get the books that these used to be mapped to?  That will eliminate about 75% of the work.
  
 Thanks

 Hi Kam,
  
 As per our phone conversation, I have attached a listing of all the products which are being migrated to EOL NetCo. If Risk could fill in the traders which will be managing each product and the Global Book ID, we will use that data as the basis for an update script to automatically assign the new books to each product. 
  
 I'll be in the office early tomorrow if you have any questions, or would like to go over any special book assignments that may need to be covered outside of a mass-update.
  
 Thanks,
