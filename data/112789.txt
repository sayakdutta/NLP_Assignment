 Jim,
  
 Will someone in legal want to involved in this filing?  Let me know.  Jeff and I are actively seeking additional sign-ons to this -- especially some customers.

 Sue,
  
 Attached is a draft of the Petition which can be circulated.
  
 I recommend that an Alliance member join the Alliance as a Petitioner to eliminate any issue about standing.  I am assuming that there is at least one willing member who was also a formal party to the proceeding which resulted in the Preferred Policy Decision.  Was the Alliance a formal party to that proceeding?
  
 The basic structure of the Petition is complete.  I shall complile the Exhibits and then review same to determine whether the citations and to add any arguments which have been overlooked.
  
 I would like to file on November 9.  I think that this Petition and the Commonwealth Petition should be filed on the same day.  If you concur, I will coordinate with Commonwealth's counsel.
  
 I look forward to your comments.  EWD
