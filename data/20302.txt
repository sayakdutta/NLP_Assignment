 
 Yeah.  Ask me how happy I am to be back at work, with a midterm in finance tomorrow nite. Sigh...
 
 Tried to call you guys yesterday to see if you wanted to stop by your folks to have abalone, but only got your voicemail.  I'm sure you were glad just to get home and relax.
 
 
 
 
     
 
 I thought the whole weekend was a total blast.  It was great having both of
 you there!!  I think every one had a very good time. There is no possible
 way that we could have done anything more in one weekend.  Pumpkin carving,
 abalone, piano roles, bluegrass, good meals, monopoly, scrabble and then the
 most incredible weather I have ever had up there!!

 It was really fun.  Thanks so much for inviting us.  It was great to get
 to play together.  I'll get Scott a check for our share of the goodies.
 Thanks again.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
