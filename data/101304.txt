 Let's bear in mind our initial meeting was before Christmas and I've never agreed to meet him....yet he still persist.
 
  
     
 
 Hi Susan -
  
 How are things?
  
 I was recently in there on the gas trading floor  at Enron. (floor 32)
  
 Is that the floor you're on?
  
 I forgot to stop by to say hello.
