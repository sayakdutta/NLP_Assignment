 
 This is a gentle reminder, and Im sure that most are aware, but under no 
 circumstances is there to be any construction activiy initiated for the 
 turbine installation at the four mainline compressor stations, until the air 
 construction permits are issued by the applicable air agency.  Construction 
 activity is defined, but is not limited to roads, trenching activity, 
 buildings, electrical poles etc.  The state and federal agencies take a very 
 dim view on initiating any attempts to initiate construction prior to 
 approval.  This approval is considered to be the air permit authorizing 
 construction of the proposed activity.  Your assistance in this compliance 
 issue will be greatly apprecaited.   Data generation and agency consultations 
 are now in progress to expidite the permit submittals.  Should you need 
 further clarification, give me a call (505) 625-8022 or via e-mail.
