 ? When the Assembly reconvenes at 4:00 PDT it appears they will likely take 
 up the budget only; there is no word at this time that they will take up AB 
 82XX, and they do not appear to have the votes needed to pass it even if they 
 did take it up.  The fact that Burton has come out against a conference 
 committee is an additional disincentive to work on 82XX.  Therefore, at this 
 time it appears unlikely that 82XX will be passed before the recess.
 
 ? Instead, it appears likely that a working group will be established to work 
 on SB 78XX during the recess.  This group will likely include members of 
 Keeley's, Hertzberg's and Burton's staffs.  These staff members may be 
 allowed to go on vacation for a few weeks before returning to work on the MOU.
 
 ? The Assembly must pass the budget before they can recess.  It is unclear at 
 this time if it will be possible to do so tonight or if it will take a few 
 days; the Senate, by leaving, has put the Assembly in a difficult position in 
 that they cannot amend anything.  Also, the four Republicans who voted for 
 the budget last week are under significant pressure not to vote for the 
 trailer bills, meaning that Speaker Hertzberg has to find other Republicans 
 willing to cross party lines -- a difficult and very unpopular thing to do at 
 this point.  This is likely why the Assembly is meeting so late in the day -- 
 to allow Hertzberg time to work on the 8 or 9 Republicans on his list.
