 I have defined the project for the students. It's   one project that is 
 divided into three sections.
 
 Feel free to stop by to talk about it.

 I understand that you have been involved with the Wharton Tiger Teams.  I am 
 the commerical team lead for Wharton recruiting.  Do you know the 3 projects 
 that the students are working on and who within Enron is working with them on 
 the projects?
 
 Thanks for helping to facilitate this opportunity for Wharton students.

 I will try to get that information from Christie.
 
 
    
  
 I can attend.  Do you know any of the details of the Tiger Team project and 
 who they are working with?  Also, names of the students would be helpful. so 
 we can see if any are applying for summer positions.

 Hello Team,
 
 I hope that everyone had a wonderful and restful holiday season.  
 
 Down to business:  The University Affairs group is putting together a tiger 
 team of students to do a project for Enron.  Those students will be in town 
 on January 18th and will be having dinner at Churrasco's that night.  I think 
 it would be a great opportunity for some of the Wharton alum to come out and 
 meet the participants, talk about Enron and eat some good food.  :-)  If you 
 are interested in participating please RSVP to me via email or at extension 
 53214 no later than 1/5/01.  
 
 Thank you and hope to see you soon,
 
 Kristin Gandy
