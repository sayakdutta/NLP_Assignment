 I would like to know if  I could take a class in the fall from 7:00- 8:15 
 a.m. ?  I would be in at 8:30 and it would be two days a week .  I would stay 
 late to make up for that time. Rain comes in at 7:30 and Felecia gets here at 
 8:00, so the phones would be covered.  Please let me know as soon as 
 possible, as registration is this week.
 
 Thanks
