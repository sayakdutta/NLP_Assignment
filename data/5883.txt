 Unfortunately, Vegas kicked my butt, but I had fun.  I would love to go to 
 Uncle George's B-day party.  Are guests invited as well b/c Shanna would like 
 to go.
 I heard you had fun with the sister this weekend - what did you do?

 Good afternoon. Welcome home. Heard from your  Mother that they took some of 
 your money. That's too bad. I have never let them  take my money! By the way, 

 Luther's BBQ, 27752 I-45 N.,, across from the Woodlands  Mall. We are going.
