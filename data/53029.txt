 Dear Vince,
 
 I hope you are doing well.  I would like to ask a favor.  Please take a look at this resume and let me know if this person can meet any needs in your group.  Ms. Jokhadze seems very interested in your area and already interviewed with Maureen Raymond.
 
 Maybe we can go to lunch whenever you are available.
 
 Thanks in advance,
 Bessik
 
 
 
     
 
 Batono Bessik,
 
 It was a pleasure speaking to you.  I appreciate the information you provided and your guidance on the opportunities at Enron.  As you recommended, my chances would be greatly enhanced if with your assistance other managers review my credentials.  
 
 I would be very grateful if you could communicate my interest to Mr. Vince Kaminsky.  I am certain my qualifications would be a good fit for a number of positions in his division.
 
 I have also applied for the associate program and perhaps you could advise me on how be considered for the program.
 
 My resume is attached.  Once again I sincerely appreciate your assistance. 
 
 Best regards,
 
 
 
 Thea Jokhadze
