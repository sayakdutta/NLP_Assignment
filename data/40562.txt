 
 Let Warren and Tom know that this is a critical. 
 
  
     
 i am attempting to coordinate a tax w Roger W, Warren Schick, and Tom Meers
 
  
     
 How do we get this loop closed?     Is this a meeting?
 
  
     
 i have yet to hear from rex rogers (for obvious reasons), and have yet to get satisfactory (to Andersen) closure on the MTBE tax
 issue
 
  
     Importance:	High
 
 What can we do about getting this done?
 
  
     
 If you want to have a "snowball" chance of getting this done this year, we need sign-off on the acctg comments.
 
 
 
 

 
 Still want to try and get it done this year. Per Stan this am. Cash is king for now and we need thepricing to get the rest of the cash.   If it has to be pushed to next year, that works, but if it can be done it needs to be.
