 I received a call from Sara Shackleton (our in-house lawyer) yesterday.  She asked us to close out our remaining futures with Carr.   Can you please close out the EURIBOR and Short Sterling futures we have left with them?  I have enclosed a list below of the positions that we show the London desk as having.  Please confirm this amount, and close out the positions.  If there is a discrepency, please give me a call tomorrow and we can discuss further.  Hope you had a good vacation.
