 
 Lynn:  I would like to standardize procedures for Argentina as much as 
 possible (this week while fresh in my mind).  Attached is Julian's message to 
 Houston.  Is this OK to put into email?  Let me know when you have time to 
 breathe.  Also, in terms of an updated memo on Argentina issues, should I add 
 to what you write or vice-versa?  My thought is to essentially update/modify 
 the legal memo written in Dec., 1997 that Brent gave to us.  Let me know.  
 Thanks.  Sara

 Julian,
 
 I spoke to Susan Bailey and Rod Nelson, and I have made a few minor changes; 
 i.e. Enron North America, ISDA Master Agreement Date, Party A , Party B.
 
 The header/footer inclute draft language.  This confirm is ready to go as 
 long as the economics match up.
 
 Please call with any other questions or requests.
 
 Have a great day!
 
 Sheetal :)

 Sheetal,
 As per our prior conversation, I would need you to put this confirm I've 
 attached into a proper draft format. I've based the confirm on a prior draft 
 that Joe Hunter sent me. Make sure to include the language "For discussion 
 purposes only". You can contact Susan Bailey for any questions on the current 
 ISDA in place with Duke.
 The potential transaction will be executed between Enron North America and 
 Duke Energy International LLC.
 As soon as you have it ready, pls. send it back to me for review.
 
 Rod, I'll need you to sign off on the credit side, although I believe it will 
 not be a problem. Pls. let us know asap.
 
 
 
 The status of this deal is urgent. We are aiming at closing it on Monday.
 Thanks for your support and give me a call if you have any question.
 
 Regards, Julian
