 
 Joe, 
 
 Attached below is a draft of an EGM update and org announcement.  It will be 
 broad in scope and will address many areas.  Please review and provide 
 comments especially on the Japan part.  I went ahead and took a stab at the 
 first cut here and expect you to make all the changes and emphasis you feel 
 is appropriate.  We are a couple of weeks away from discussing every player 
 (Morten Erik) that is why I left it very broad.  Please take a moment, change 
 and send back to me for examination and incorporation.
 
 I wanted to get this out on Friday, but may have to wait until early next 
 week while i am on the road.
 
 Thanks,
 Mike
