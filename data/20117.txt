 Eldon is having some computer problems, so I am sending this out.  It might
 be a good idea to copy me on your e-mail picks this week.

 
 
 Let's hear it for the 49'er faithful!  All four of this week's winners put
 their money on the Niners!
 
  1st place - NARVCO - also the ONLY person to take Baltimore over Denver!
  2nd place - HANK - hey, wait a minute - he's a RAIDERS fan!
  3rd place - ELDON
  4th place - GROWNEY
 
 4 more people sat down thanks to the Colts and the Jaguars:  Andy, Daryl,
 Eldon and Kent - leaving 16 people in the pool.
