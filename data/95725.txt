 Hope all is well.
 
 I received your email.  In the US we do physical power puts and calls,  
 usually on a daily, weekly or monthly basis (e.g several month deal that 
 gives party right to receive/sell energy on a daily basis).  The confirmation 
 for them is very simple, and generally assumes an underlying master that 
 would govern the physical delivery if the option is exercised as well as all 
 the other general terms and conditions.  
 By copy of this email, I would ask Leslie Hansen to send you copies of a put 
 and call confirmation which she can get from our documentation group.
 
 Looking forward to seeing you soon back in Houston
 
 (Thanks Leslie)

 The commercial team in Sao Paulo is getting creative and I have been asked to 
 find out if EPMI has ever created or used a physical power put or call option 
 form.  Do we have any forms that I could give to the attorneys in Sao Paulo 
 to review?  I appreciate any help you can give me.  Thanks,
 Brent
