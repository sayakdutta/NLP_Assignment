 For September 28th,  we have sold a financial swap to Frontera for hours ending 7- 11.   We bill them $20,  Enpower #794481,  for various hours.
 I will take the floating imbalance price for the following megawatt totals :
 
 he7 - 310 mw's
 he8 - 310 
 he 9- 240
 he10 - 140
 he 11 - 60
 
 Frontera will be running a resource imbalance for these hours.  (see imbal.  # 794516).       I should be allocated the imbalance charges as listed above and Frontera is responsible for any remaining imbalance for this day..
 This is a financial swap that we will be offering our customers and I need your feedback on any requirements that you have in settling this product.
 
 Thanks,
 JMF

 Ken,
 As discussed earlier,  I am proposing ramping up late for the onpeak sale that Frontera made for tomorrow.       If we must sell the offpeak hours required to affect a 340 mw onpeak schedule,  I show that we would almost negate all profit from the sale.
 
 I am suggesting starting your ramp beginning hour ending 7 and purchasing a fixed price swap from Enron for the short generation.    Basically,  you sold the preschedule for $21 and we would fix your price for hours ending 7-11 at $20.     
 
 The benefit in this swap would be:
 hedge against floating price
 lock in $1 profit on sale for short portion of the schedule, increasing revenues
 avoid losing approximately $10k on selling ramping schedule -  $4 is an optimistic real time sales price at this point,  however,  I used this in the analysis.
 
 
 
 Please let me know what you think.      Enron will be offically rolling this swap product out to all of our service customers.   
 I  think this would be a good fit your company and I would like to try this for Friday's run.
 
 Additionally,   I think that there may be a good down balancing or OOM down  opportunity for tomorrow because of this preschedule.
 
 
 Let me know what you think,
