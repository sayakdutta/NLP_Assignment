 The proposal that ENA submitted to Peevey/Freeman includes a proposal to 
 reduce demand by 400 MWs if the state implements financial incentives for 
 such reductions (i.e., if the state is willing to pay, say, 7 cents/kwh to 
 "produce," it ought to willing to pay 7 cents to "reduce.")  That proposal 
 was distributed to the usual, company wide email distribution list last week 
 when it was submitted.  We can discuss further on the phone call this morning.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Apparently there are rumors that Ken Lay promised to make some kind of 
 investment in California when he was talking to folks in the state ($300 
 million in DSM?)  Do any of you know what this commitment might be?  Sandy 
 needs to be filled in on this.  Let me know as soon as you can.
