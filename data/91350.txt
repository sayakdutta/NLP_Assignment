 
 I can get to the CIG web homepage but I cannot get into Cutomer Activites, Citrix, or Informational Postings.  It is critical for nominations and information purposes that I can get into these areas this morning.  Please advise as to how to access these portions of the website.  It seems like there are changes in the URL address and maybe that is the problem.
 
 Thank you,
