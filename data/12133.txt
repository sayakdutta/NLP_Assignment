 Gentlemen,
 
 Please obtain proper ROW & environmental permits for the attached project.  
 It consists of approx 25 ft of 12" pipe and block valve inside the WT1 
 Station yard.  There will be a hydrotest.  And there will be minor excavation 
 for the supports.
 
 Butch, do I need to send in a USGS map for this?
 
 Thanks Jim
