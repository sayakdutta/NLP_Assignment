 FYI  Aquila was a decent seller of Jun and Jun-Oct NGPL/LA today. Not much action on the Nov01-Mar02.
 I'll keep you informed.  Feel free to call me at x3-6320 if you have any questions.
 
  
     
 Kevin,
 
 Per our conversation this morning, the attached spreadsheet should give you an idea how we are managing NGPL NSS storage.  The spreadsheet breaks out the current inventory level and the daily rights associated with the storage.
 
 Let me know if you have any questions.
