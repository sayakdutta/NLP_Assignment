 
 I won't be able to go with you Friday night, I wasn't even invited.  Keep in touch and we will figure out a time to get together.
 
 
     
 
 
 I'd LOVE to be your personal assistant.  What would you like me to do first? 
   Saturday night is looking rough because my daughter Brigette, leaves for 
 Sea Camp on Sunday morning, for an entire week.  Any possibility that you 
 may come to the cocktail party on Friday?  Today kinda sucks, but it's 
 expected right?
