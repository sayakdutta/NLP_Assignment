 This looks good especially if you get Harris.  What do they want me to be part of if anything.  I was assuming the Breakfast and the Lunch and hopefully the meeting with Harris. Can you let me know so I can set up my schedule. I would like to go see the Toronto office and also get some personal time in.  
 
 Thanks 
 
 John
