 
 I hope that we are planning to contest this proposed amendment.

 On October 15, 2001, the Midwest ISO filed an amendment to 
 Section 17.5 of its Open Access Transmission Tariff to charge 
 a fee for non-confirmed transmission service requests for 
 transmission service greater than one week. Midwest ISO 
 has requested an effective date December 15, 2001.
 Interventions and protests are due November 5.
 
 Let me know if you need further information.
