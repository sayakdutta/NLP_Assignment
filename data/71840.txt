 Folks - 
 
 Scheduling a meeting time is becoming nightmarish.  Feb 19th and 20th are no
 longer possible.  In the following chart, please indicate your available
 dates and e-mail back to me as soon as possible.  
 
 Hopefully, building a power plant will be easier than coordinating
 schedules.
 
 Steve
