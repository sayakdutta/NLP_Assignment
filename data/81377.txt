 
 Fred, 
 
 I just wanted to say thank you for the golf on Saturday.  I had a really good time and enjoyed playing your course very much.  You should be very proud of it as I think it one of the best laid out courses I've played. 
 
 Thank You,
 
 Jon
 
 PS.  Hopefully we get to play together next time.
