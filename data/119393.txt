 Mark, 
 May I have your permission to proceed with ordering a new desktop hard drive for Samantha Boyd?   Please see supporting documentation below.  Thank you.

 If Samantha's machine has cratered, yes, it's okay with me to order her a new machine.  Please get with Jason Sherman regarding the standard desktop model to be ordered.  Thanks.
 
  
     
 Good morning Janette,
 
 I need to order Samantha a new desktop hard drive.  With your permission, and Mark Taylor's permission, what model do you suggest I order?  Please advise.  Thanks!

 Keegan,
 
 Samantha's hard drive crashed today, I'm having hardware look at it, but you might want to speak with Janette about ordering Samantha a new machine, she has an older compaq desktop that has had several major hardware failures over the last 6 months. Hardware can replace the hard drive but in order to save in time and productivity, a new machine might need to be considered. Let me know.
