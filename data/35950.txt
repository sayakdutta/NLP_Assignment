 Hi guys --
 
 Hopefully these curves are covered between the three of you!  Attached are 
 the 10 curves reviewed for the month of February.  Of these 10, the curves in 
 question are:
 
 NGI-PGE TOPOCK
 IF-HEHUB
 IF-VALERO TX
 IF-NNG TOK
 IF-TW PERMIAN
 IF-TRANSCO Z1
 IF-TENN Z5
 
 If you could, please identify the factors that are driving their drastic 
 changes in shape and seasonality as compared to the prior month.  Please do 
 not hesitate to contact me with any questions.
 
 Thanks,
 Jennifer
