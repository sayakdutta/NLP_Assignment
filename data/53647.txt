 Dear Vince,
 
 
 I'm working in the Continental Power Structured Products group here in London, and we'd like to use the Clewlow/Strickland book "Energy Derivatives. Pricing & Risk Management".
 Is there such a thing as an "Enron discount", and if so, how should we purchase the book (two copies) to get it?
 
 Thanks,
 THOMAS.
