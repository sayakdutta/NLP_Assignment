 Just a reminder concerning follow-up with The Weather Channel and Energizer 
 Holdings regarding potential hurricane derivatives.
 
 Additionally, I found the following link which describes Ray-O-Vac's recent 
 earnings warning.  Among other things, they mention that they had tough 
 comparisons due to an active storm season the year before.  I believe they 
 are referencing hurricanes and represent another potential opportunity in my 
 opinion.

 One more thing, as I mentioned in our conversation, I believe that The 
 Weather Channel is an ideal candidate for approaching concerning hedging 
 against a lack of extreme weather of all kinds.  I know that they are 
 financially "not doing so well" at present due in some part to a lack of 
 hurricane activity and are now enjoying great ratings due to the extreme 
 cold.  They may be a hard sell but they are as purely exposed as anyone and 
 should be worth the effort, especially after the recent story they did on us.
 
 Please let me know how I may be of assistance.
 
 
 Thanks,
 
 Charlie
