 Hi Vince,
 
 How are you?
 
 I'm doing well at the new job.
 
 I heard the news from Shirley. It's something we expected but
 confirmation of the expectation seemed like ultimatum, which is sad.
 As I mentioned before, I would like to have a lunch with you and listen
 some career advice from you sometime this week or any time at your
 convenience.  Is it O.K. with you?
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Jaesoo
