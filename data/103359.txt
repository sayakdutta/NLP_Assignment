 candidate using the printed form but I thought she looked very good and after 
 speaking with Elizabeth to get her impressions (which I have not done), I 
 would probably make her an offer.  Sara

 Please send me an e-mail today with your impressions of this candidate so 
 that I can report back to HR.  Thanks.
