 
 Attached is the Gas Purchase Agreement between Enron Compression Services 
 Company and Enron North America Corp.  This backs the gas deal between ECS 
 and ECC, LLC.  The pricing and terms are identical.
 
 Note:  In the Kachina deal we used Enron Natural Gas Marketing instead of ENA 
 for this gas deal.  After discussions with tax and accounting, there were no 
 objections to using ENA in this deal.
 
 
 Please review.
