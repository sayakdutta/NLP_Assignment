 Dear Michelle:
  
 Thank you for registering for the Weather Trading Europe prize draw
 sponsored by Corporate Insurance and Risk. We're pleased to let you know that your name
 has been drawn as one of the winners.
  
 In order to confirm your free delegate pass for the event, please respond to
 this email with all your contact details. We will then register you for the
 event and send out information about booking your hotel room. We suggest
 that you do this as soon as possible as we are quickly running out of space
 at the hotel.
  
 If you are going to be unable to make the event, please let us know, as we
 will pass on the ticket to another prize draw entrant. Your place is
 transferable to one of your colleagues, so if you can't make it feel free to
 pass on the ticket to one of your colleagues and simply let us know.
  
 We look forward to seeing you in Amsterdam.
  
 Regards,
 Allison
