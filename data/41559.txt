 Sara Shackleton just left for vacation until after Labor Day, but asked me to respond to your e-mail regarding sending us your completed ISDA schedule.  Our Credit Department has said that Enron Corp. will provide a parent guaranty for ECT Investments, Inc., however, they would like for CSFB to also provide a guaranty since CSFB (Europe) is not a rated entity, or provide independent financial statements for CSFB (Europe).  Our Credit Department did not provide us with a cap for the Enron Corp. guaranty.
 
 You can send your ISDA Schedule to my attention and we will proceed with reviewing same.
 
 Thank you.
