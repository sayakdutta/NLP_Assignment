 SRP would like to host 2.5 days of settlement discussions in Phoenix. The
 proposed schedule is:
 
 EOC   =09=099/11      1 - 4 pm
 All parties=099/12 =099 - 5 pm
 All parties=099/13=099 - noon
 
 The intent is to discuss any and all settlement proposals, as well as
 feedback from parties on the proposal sent out by SRP. Please circulate any
 comments or proposals to this distribution list prior to the meetings. All
 materials will be for settlement purposes only.
 
 I have not invited El Paso, nor all of the parties. IF you peruse the
 distribution list and see a name that should be on it, let me know.
 
 As you know, Joel is on vacation through Labor Day. Please RSVP to me as to
 whether or not you will be attending or sending a representative.
 
 I look forward to seeing you in September.
