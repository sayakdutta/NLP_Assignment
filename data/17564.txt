 Title: California in the Dark
 URL: http://www20.cera.com/eprofile?u=35&m=2302
 
 
 In a recent Washington Post op-ed piece, Dan Yergin and Larry Makovich 
 discuss the continued mess of California's electric power problems. Rather 
 than fixing the flaws, the current policies from Sacramento are moving 
 California down the road to an expensive public power setup and higher prices 
 for consumers and businesses. And the shortage is going to get worse this 
 summer.
