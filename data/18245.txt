 Just so we're all on the same page......Dasovich will arrive in Houston on 
 Monday (mid-day) and will travel with Dr. Lay beginning on Wednesday (to 
 Austin) and then on to LAX, Sacramento etc.  Steve said there really isn't 
 time to have a pre-briefing so any questions that Ken has will have to be 
 addressed enroute to CA.  
 
 Rosalee....we're giving Steve the briefing book today so he can review over 
 the weekend and we'll have a final copy to Ken before he departs next week.
