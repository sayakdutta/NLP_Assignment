 
 Why is the body shop being closed?  Why can't it continued to be operated on a reduced staff with out exercise classes?
 
  
     
 The decision to close the Body Shop came after the December 15 payroll run, so you will incur a deduction on your December 15 paycheck.  However, Payroll will refund those charges on your December 31 paycheck.  
 
 As a reminder the Body Shop will be open from 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. today through Friday, December 14, to allow members to retrieve personal items from lockers.  
 
 Thank you.
