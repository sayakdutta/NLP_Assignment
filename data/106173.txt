 I am not certain that the existing resolution permits repurchase and reverse 
 repurchase transactions and securities lending, bonds borrow pledge, etc. as 
 the brokerage consent was not written to accommodate these types of 
 transactions.  However, if the repo party will accept our existing format, 
 then we need not worry.  I'll call Ted Leh and try to find the proper Goldman 
 person.

 Sara,
 
 Can you please provide your findings on the following items:
 
 1. Determine with Cheryl that ECI is in fact authorized to transact Repos
 
 2. How robust the Goldman Repo agreements are, and their sutability to ECI.
 
 3. An estimate on how long it will take to set up the Goldman Repo Agreements 
 in ECI's name.
 
 
 Can you please also provide any ideas how ECI or ECL could transact a Repo 
 trade today using existing documentation.
 
 
 London has indicated an urgent need to carry out these transactions.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Tom
