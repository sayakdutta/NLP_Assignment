 Hi Dolores/Frank:
 
 (1) Did you check on removing the TV from EB3866?  If there's a huge cost for 
 relocating the TV, please let me know. Also, what is the cost for
  removing the TV?
  Charge CO/RC = 0413/105658
 
 (2) We need to have the secretarial cube at EB3875 lowered to 42".  I guess 
 this is a request for construction????
  Charge CO/RC = 0413/105659
 
 (3) The copier has been delivered by my desk at EB3855A from 3AC.  Can we get 
 a status on the engineers getting the plug ready?
  ( you know what I mean).
 
 (4) We also need to get a drawing for reconstructing the area between my desk 
 at EB3855A and EB3858/EB3858A/EB3858C/EB3858B.  We need to   maximize this 
 space and add to secretarial workstations and maybe some type of closure to 
 block the sound of the copier.
 
 (5) We need to relocate the library currently at EB3858C to the team room at 
 EB3872.
 
 (6) Can I please get a current copy of the floor plan.
 
 (7) The Cost Memo has been signed for the final phase of construction by Mark 
 Haedicke.  Can I get the estimated date for construction to begin?
   I need to put in a churn request as soon as possible.
 
 Today, Raul w/ McCoy came by and we did a walk through for the offices that 
 were just completed.  
 
 
 Thanks.
