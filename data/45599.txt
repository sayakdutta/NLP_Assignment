 
 All of the counterparties on today's list are ESP's, so I will approve them 
 for all financial products.  If the aren't ESP's I would not approve them for 
 financial products including Australian financial products.  Further, if they 
 cannot meet the ESP test on their own, i.e., they are relying on a parent 
 guaranty or a letter of credit to make them an ESP, I would approve them for 
 all financial products, except Australian power (but they could trade weather 
 per our earlier emails).

 Assuming they want trade Australian power do  they have USD6million in assets?
