 Matt,
 
 That is cool. I can't really change the trip but I am sure I will be back in Vancouver soon. Send me your vitals and I'll let you know the next time I am in town. Or give me shout if you are ever out in Calgary. Do you have Atkinson's office phone number? I seem to have misplaced it. 
 
 Thanx
 
 Chris

 Chris,
  
 I can't do February 2nd.  As it turns out my gal made  dinner arrangements a while ago with another couple for the evening of the  2nd.  Is there anyway you could either come a week earlier or later? I'd  love to have a few with you.  Let me know.  Have you called Bill  Ryan?
  
 Regards,
