 
 This is the first of two emails I'm sending you.  Lee revised the Salmon 
 contract you did, and now it needs to be "unrevised" in these ways.

 Kay:
 
 I'm on the phone with Lee and he agrees that we need to put the stabilizer
 back in.
 
 This will change the various amounts, I think, as follows:
 
 Unit Liability Amount:  14,103,675
 Maximum Liability Amount:  56,414,700
 Purchase Amount:  50,785,900
 
 The rest of the document is okay.  We are still waiting for the lender docs
 back but don't expect any show stoppers.  Lee will be back in the office
 tomorrow and can sign documents (if the agreements are okay), and date
 effective today if that is a requirement for Enron.
 
 Otherwise, we'll wait for your instructions.

 Me again.
 
 Here's the version I referenced in my earlier email.  I believe we need to
 restore the stabilizer stuff, but I wanted to get agreement.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
 
 
 
 

 
   
  
 
 Kent/Kay-
 
 I've redline the Salmon contract for Exhibits A and B, Purchase Amount,
 Maximum Liability Amount, and Unit Liability Amount.  The Power System
 Stabilizer has been struck from scope, because I can recall Bill Williams
 advising that LV would need them, Delta/Salmon would not.  That's consitent
 with the other units going to CA (w/ Intergen).
