 
 Matt,
 
 Can you let me know if the following products are approved for trading for 
 Singapore counterparties, and what restrictions, if any, they might have 
 (like the eligible swap participant rules in the U.S.):
 
 Commodity Derivatives (energy commodity, metals)
 Weather Derivatives
 Credit Derivatives
 
 Further, would there be any limitation for a Singapore counterparty to trade 
 any of the products we offer, physical or financial online?  I am going to 
 attach to this one of our recent excel spreadsheets showing all the products 
 we trade.
 
 Are there any counterparties that are problematic for derivatives in 
 Singapore?  For instance, here in the U.S., we flag governmental entities for 
 no trading until we have a master in place, or upfront due diligence required 
 before we can approve mutual funds or hedge funds, etc.  
 
 
 
 Thanks!
