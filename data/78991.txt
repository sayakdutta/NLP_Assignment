 
 Tuesday begins Bidweek.  I try to restrict time away from the desk to after 2:15.  Is that possible?

 Jim is not available on Friday.  How about Tuesday morning, April 24, anytime. How about 9 am? 
 
  
     
 My basis trader is out Friday, so I need to cover his EOL stack until 3:30.  I can get together with you after 3:30.  Monday I am booked.
 Any way that we can get together after 3:30 Friday?

 Michelle,
 
 I suggest you schedule a meeting with the above to discuss how Enron, AEP and HPL will interact with respect to responding to the bid docs.

 Brian, Janet, Chris:
 
 I spoke to Danny McWhirter of CPS this morning. He said he expects to have the RFP sent out first week of May. CPS has scheduled a May 10th meeting in Houston (probably at the Hyatt) for all invited bidders for Q&A meeting re: bids. He mentioned El Paso, Aquila and Duke. Danny is pushing for bids to be due on June 1.
 
 I am trying to get him to play golf with me when he comes, so we'll see! If any of you are interested, let me know.
