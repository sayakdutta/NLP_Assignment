 Mark,
 
 We have customers who are now filling out the new form of the Australian PA. 
 As a result, we will need an Online Australian ETA very shortly.
 
 Can you please approve/disapprove of the ETA form forwarded by David Minns? 
 (copy attached). Once we have your approval, we will put it on the system.
 
 
 
 Thanks,
 
 Dave
