 
 I called and asked for an information packet on the Enron insurance plan (it 
 is through MetLife) last week.  I will let you know as soon as it comes.
 
 Thanks for the update on Tim & Sharon.  I guess the down-side of a 2 year old 
 is that she may already have a fairly well formed personality, but the 
 up-side is they will know she is healthy and she is still young enough to 
 learn a new language easily.
 
 Feel free to let me know when the bank statement comes - I seem to remember 
 that we came up with a scheme to deal with that last year.  I'll bet we can 
 do it again!  And until then we can just bask in the light of this amazing 
 run in the ENE stock price - wow!
