 We have some investors who are interested in knowing more about the pipes.  Can you please tell me who can anwser/confirm the following:
 
 1.  Per the latest rate cases the nominal ROE's and related capital structures are as follows:
 
 
 	ROE				12.89%	12.18%	13.49%
 	Equity Ratio(equity to debt)	60%	60%	42%
 
 2. Is rate base calculated on equity or assets?
 
 3. What was the percentage of capacity for each of the pipes for the first nine months of this year?
 
 It would be very helpful if you or someone could respond this afternoon. 
 
 Thanks!
