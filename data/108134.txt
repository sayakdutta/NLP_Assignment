 Wharton interviews were a huge success - we interviewed approximately 48 
 students in the first round of interviews, 28 students in the second round 
 and invited 19 back to Super Saturday on Dec. 2.  A list of the students that 
 we invited is in Kristin's email below.  I think that we've got a great group 
 of candidates.  A huge thank you to all of the interviewers - Jayshree Desai, 
 Tom Dutta, Bill Keeney, John King, Catherine Clark, Ranabir Dutt, Jeff 
 Golden, Chuck Ward, Rajesh Chettiar, Natalie Halich and  Colin Jackson. It 
 you haven't already done so, it would be great if you could sign up to either 
 attend a dinner or interview for the Dec. 2 Super Saturday.  To sign up, go 
 to the analyst/associate web site at http://axis.enron.com/aaxis.asp.
