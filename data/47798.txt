 
 On or about 5/2/01we opened the above counterparty to transact Canadian/US 
 Currency Swaps on EnronOnline (which they cannot transact under the old 
 Master Energy Price Swap Agreement, they would have to transact udner the 
 GTC).  After discussing this counterparty w/Sara Shackleton, an attorney in 
 the swap group, it appears that Sara has been talking to Morgan Stanley and 
 Morgan Stanley does all its interest rate & currency business out of Morgan 
 Stanley Capital Services, Inc.  We can keep Morgan Stanley Capital Group open 
 for currency swaps, but if they don't trade currency swaps out of that 
 company we'll know why.  Sara is already working on an ISDA Master for 
 Capital Services for Gary Hickerson's group.
