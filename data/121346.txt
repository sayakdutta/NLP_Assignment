 
 Karla,
 
 Have you received these confirms yet?  Please let me know.
 
 thanks,

 In June 02 we should have sold to you 1487 MMBtu/day at CG instead of 1750
 and in July 02 we should have sold you 1530 MMBtu/day at CG instead of 1640.
 Thanks.
 
 
     
 
 Please remind me of the exact changes so I can go to my back office.
 Things have just been crazy around here so sorry for overlooking this.  '
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kim
 
  
     
 Do you need something from me in order to redo those confirms we talked
 about?
