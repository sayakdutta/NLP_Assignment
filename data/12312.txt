 Larry, 
 Do you know if Enron is hiring for IS people?  My brother in law just  graduated with a degree in MIS and is looking for a job after the summer.   He is finishing up with his classes this summer.
  
 He was saying he wanted to work with ERP...whatever that means.  And  People Soft, whatever that is too.
  
 Can you help me out please.
