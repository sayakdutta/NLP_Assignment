 Sara:
 
 Here is my contact info.  Please send me yours.
 
 Please feel free to call Forest Felvey at CSI to check signals on the
 confidentiality agreement issue you mentioned.  He will verify that Baker
 Botts is assisting CSI on swap issues and that it is okay to communicate
 with me.  [I've copied Forest with this email for his info.]
 
 As we discussed, I will get you copies of the new LPS documentation relating
 to the 2000 CSI franchise tax restructuring and you will get me copies of
 the existing Enron/CSI contractual documentation relating to the original
 1998 arrangements and any amendments, etc., since then.
 
 Thereafter, we can figure out what our next steps are.
 
 Thanks.
