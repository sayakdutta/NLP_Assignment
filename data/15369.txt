 
 Glad to hear it.  On the down side, it appears that I won't get you that 
 email I promised until tomorrow.  If that's totally unacceptable, let me know.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Professor Michaels, 
 
 Further to the voicemail message I left for you today regarding speaking 
 early next year at the IPPSA Conference in Banff, Alberta the details are: 
 
 Topic: The California Experience - Lessons that Alberta Can Learn From (or 
 something like this title - although I was unable to open the presentation on 
 your website entitled" "California's Electrical Disaster and the Furture of 
 Competitive Power" I would expect based on this title that much of what is in 
 that presentation would be of interest to those attending the IPPSA 
 Conference. 
 
  19-20, 2001)
 
 Reimbursements: Travel (economy class) and one night at Rimrock Hotel.  Also 
 free conference registration (which includes meals during conference).
 
 Deadline for presentation materials so they can be included in the conference 
 binder: February 28, 2001
 
 Conference Information: the conference is held at the Rimrock Hotel in Banff, 
 Alberta and has been sold out the last three years.  It will attract about 
 400 delegates in 2001 from across Canada and the U.S. with the majority of 
 the delegates being generation developers, large consumers, marketers, and 
 policy makers from Western Canada. The speakers include a number of respected 
 academics/consultants from across North America, senior industry 
 representatives, senior government representatives, and senior 
 representatives from the Alberta Transmission Administrator and Power Pool of 
 Alberta. 
 
 I look forward to your reply.  My telephone number is (403) 974-6746.
 
 Regards,
 
 Rob Hemstock
