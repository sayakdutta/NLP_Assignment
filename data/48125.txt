 Here are the details on the LV Cogen change so that you can get it into the 
 system.
 
 We are going to amend the Gas Swap confirm referencing the Inside FERC 
 Natural Gas Week (Ref Deal No. N02595.1).
 
 The change will be to delete the floating price reference to Inside FERC NW 
 Pipeline and change it from Inside FERC NW Pipeline to the Natural Gas Week 
 Opal( Ref Deal No. N02595.2).  This will make the two confirms for 2500 
 MMbtu/d match each other.  The Fixed price component basis on the revised 
 confirm will change from <$0.28> to <$0.27>.
 
 We are currently working on a confirm.
 
 Let me know ASAP if you have an issues with the change.
