 sightseeing trips.  Will discuss with Eric.

 Jon, I'm attaching a memo sent to me by one of my
 previous Enron people in China.  Lillian Li no longer
 works for Enron and was not available to help us in
 Beijing (she got married and will be moving in June).
 Anyway, she has this travel agency friend who has
 recommended stuff for Shanghai and Beijing.  It's all
 spelled out in the attachment.  For 3 days in
 Shanghai, for ($285 per person for 3 days and
 nights),$90 USD a day per person which includes hotel,
 meals, transportation, tickets, etc. sounds
 reasonable.  What do you think?  I do like the sight
 seeing she recommended.
 
 Then, in Beijing for 7 nights in a good hotel,
 sightseeing, transportation, tickets, tour guide, etc.
 for ($525 per person for 6 days and nights), $88 per
 day per person didn't sound bad either.  Here in
 Beijing I like the sightseeing she recommends.  Again,
 what do you think?
 
 What she failed to tell me was the cost of the airline
 ticket from Shanghai to Qingdao to Beijing.  Could you
 check on that for us?
 
 If there is a better way to skin this cat (no pun
 intended, just that all these Nancy boys are afraid of
 the chinese food and all) please advise.
 
 Congrats,look forward to seeing and hearing from you.....Dan
