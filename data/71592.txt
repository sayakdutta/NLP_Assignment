 I know T. Mueller is on holiday.  I suspect he would want AI and St. Paul to 
 agree in writing that this doesn't prejudice any rights/constitute a waiver, 
 etc.
 
 You may have considered this already, but payment to /request for payment to 
 EEPC may trigger the responsibility to pay VAT. 
 
 Good luck, and keep me posted.
