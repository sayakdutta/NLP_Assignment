 Your language is fine.  I will get the bank info to you tomorrow.
 
 We faxed back the confirm yesterday.  Our mgmt assistant did it.  If you need 
 the name of the recipient, I can get that for you.

 Dick:
 
 After our conversation, I spoke with our settlements people again who
 requested an EWEB invoice when Enron owes money to EWEB.  I propose that we
 add a section to the Schedule entitled "Accounts" (Part 3(h)) as follows:
 
 "Prior to each payment date for any Transaction, Party A (ENA) shall
 provide Party B with an invoice reflecting the net payment owed by a party.
 Notwithstanding the foregoing, Party B shall provide Party A with an
 invoice prior to any payment date on which Party A owes a net payment to
 Party B.  With respect to all payments hereunder, and except as otherwise
 directed in writing, the parties shall comply with the following payment
 instructions:
 
 [bank, account no., ABA no.]"
 
 Please provide me with EWEB's account data and let me know if you have any
 comments.  I'll send the blackline immediately after I hear from you.
 
 Also, I have not received EXECUTED CONFIRMATIONS.  Have these been sent to
 anyone at Enron?  Sara
