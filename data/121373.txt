 
 Just got an email regarding our trip to the Caribbean in Jan - more guys have signed up that women!  You should definitely think about it - especially since there is such a large group of us.  (protection in numbers)  There tends to be lots of drinking though - but a very laid back and relaxing time hanging out on beautiful beaches! 
 
 Glad to hear you had a good weekend.  I was sick with a cold/sinus infection the entire weekend - stayed home alone - am sick of myself!  Is Caraba's still the place of choice tonight?  Just let me know what time.

 Hello! Yes, I'm good for tonight. I need to workout though--I pigged out all
 w/e when I wasn't playing golf. No sparks--we are definitely just friends.
 I'm sick of this! But, the weather was fantastic and we had a great time.
 
 How was your w/e?
