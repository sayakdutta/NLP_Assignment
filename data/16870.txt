 Here are my (very minor) suggestions.  I understand that the plan is to have 
 the letter come from Ken Lay.  Given the current tone and structure of the 
 letter, might be more appropriate to come from Chris, as originally drafted, 
 but I've modified so that it comes from Ken Lay. 
 
 Best,
 Jeff
