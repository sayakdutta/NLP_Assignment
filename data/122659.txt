 
 I'm trying to take next week off.  Not sure I can swing Friday yet.  I might be able to leave early.  I am definitely game for attending.  Does it start on Friday and go through Sunday?  ILY, K.
 
 
     
 
 ...in fact, would you consider taking this Friday off from work?  I just
 talked to Bob Corrigan and scheduled to meet him for lunch and we could both
 see him......and we could catch the CFA show, too...
