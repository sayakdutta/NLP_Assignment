 
 Here are the most recent versions from Clifford Chance.  They were sent to 
 Sullivan & Cromwell yesterday to be "Americanized" and are still drafts with 
 a number of open issues yet to be resolved - so we can easily make changes as 
 necessary to solve issues you may raise.
 
 The PA = Password Application - to be signed by counterparty & sent to us 
 before a password is issued.
 The ETA = Electronic Trading Agreement - to be agreed to online before 
 trading is permitted.
 The ROETA = Read Only ETA - to be agreed to online by persons wishing access 
 to the site to view but not trade (probably misnamed - should be ROPA or 
 something that doesn't sound like they'll be able to trade).

 Dear Louise
 
 Thank you for your e-mail to Tim.  Please find attached revised versions of
 the PA, ETA and ROETA taking into account Scott Sefton's comments and our
 recent telephone discussions.  Please note that I have not referred to the
 NBP side letters as I have agreed with Edmund Cooper that this will be dealt
 with in the long form descriptions.
 
 These documents are identical to the documents I sent to Edmund yesterday
 save for a minor change to the limitation of liability clause.
 
 I look forward to receiving your comments as soon as possible so that I can
 prepare country specific versions.
 
 Kind regards
 
 Andrew Wilkinson
