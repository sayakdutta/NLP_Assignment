 Cathy:  please see the following response from Alice Gruber:
 
 IMMIGRATION MATTERS
 
 Q: I've been working for Enron under a US work permit.  How will my
 immigration status be affected when my employment ceases?
 
 
 A:  Your work permit is specific to Enron and is not transferable to
 any other employer without additional processing by the INS.  A
 non-immigrant (H-1B, L-1, TN, etc.) is out of status once s/he has been
 terminated.  Once the non-immigrant is out of status, in theory, s/he should
 depart the US as soon as possible.  If the non-immigrant can find a new
 employer and file within approximately 30 to 60 days from the date of
 termination, the INS has generally overlooked the violation of the
 maintenance of status.  Keep in mind this is not a hard and fast rule, and
 the INS has the ability to enforce shorter or longer periods on a
 case-by-case basis.
 
 If you are offered another job in the US your prospective employer
 will have to apply for a new work permit on your behalf.
 If you do not get another job in the US and you wish to remain here
 then you must seek permission to stay on other grounds.
 
 Upon termination, the foreign national should contact an attorney and
 schedule a time for a full consultation (in-person whenever possible)
 regarding all issues.  There are often many issues which need to be
 addressed as each person's immigration issues are unique.
 
 
 I hope this is what you are looking for.  Let me know if we need anything else?
 Thanks
 Margaret
