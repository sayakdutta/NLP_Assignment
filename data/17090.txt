 
 Dudes:
 My other team has now finished the case that's due on Thursday (in another 
 class), so I will spend this evening turning what's been passed around into 
 memo format and distribute for review and comment by (what will likely be 
 late) this evening.  I'm travelling tomorrow--back late afternoon--and can 
 work on it more tomorrow night.
 
 Best
 Jeff
