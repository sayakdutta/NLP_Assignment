 Tim, 
 I am sorry I missed catching up with you this afternoon.  My afternoon was  
 cut short by a kidney stone problem I am experiencing. 
 Nevertheless, I reviewed retention 2001 options6.doc and made significant  
 revisions to it.  Please see the attached. 
 You sent two forms of letters and I only reviewed the one document as the  
 other seemed to be very similar after a cursory review.  If the attached is  
 acceptable to everyone, the second document can be conformed to it.   
 I've copied Pam Butler and Michelle Cash on this memo. 
 Regards, 
 Pat
