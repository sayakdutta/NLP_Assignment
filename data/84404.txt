 Congratulations!!  
 
 On behalf of all of the Asset Group I would like to extend our appreciation 
 and congratulations for making Hanover Measurement Services (HMS) a reality.  
 A year of creative effort and determination, has transformed the project from 
 the sale/leaseback of HPL's metering equipment into a viable measurement 
 services company.    HMS provides the opportunity to reduce HPL's operating 
 costs and leverage Enron's technical expertise to provide measurement 
 services to third party customers.   
 
 This project is an example of how the Asset Group must leverage our resources 
 and existing assets to create sustainable, recurring earnings in the years 
 ahead.  Each of you contributed to this success and your efforts are greatly 
 appreciated by HPL and senior Enron management.  Our task now is to expand  
 HMS' customer base and position the company to take advantage of emerging 
 measurement, communications and systems technology.
 
 Again, congratulations on establishing and financing HMS, and please share 
 our appreciation with team members who assisted you in this success.
 
 Regards,
 Brian
