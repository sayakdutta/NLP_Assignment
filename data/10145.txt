 Here's what we have so far on the code to be incorporate into the SCADA Excel Addin.  I'll come up today at 3:00 to discuss it.
 
 1.  NNG CAS operational capacity
 
 select 
  a.nb_poi,
  b.dt_date,
  qt_operational_cap_mcf = sum(a.qt_operational_cap_mcf)
 
 from nngadhoc..cas_poi_oper_cap a,
  nngadhoc..tms_date b
 
 where nb_cmpy = 179
  and nb_poi = 129
  and b.dt_date = convert (char(10), getdate(), 111)
 -- and id_poi_role = 'R' ???
  and b.dt_date between dt_effective and dt_termination
 
 group by 
  a.nb_poi,
  b.dt_date
 
 
 2.  NNG Current month imbalance
 
 	Alice in working on this one.
 
 
 3.  NNG Accum. month imbalance
 
 	Alice in working on this one.
 
 
 4. NNG Storage previous day / current day into.
 
 	Alice in working on this one.
