  FMLA 
 
 
 
 Please note we have corrected this chart under the section
 
 "Certification."
 We have deleted the language "Employer pays for both the second and third
 opinion" and replaced it with
 "Employer must pay the cost of the medical verification not covered by
 insurance or other benefit plan"
 
 - Those of you who have requested to receive the document by fax will
 receive it later today.
 
 - Please note OFLA applies to employers with more than 25 employees in
 Oregon. FMLA applies to employers with more than 50 employees.
 
 -I apologize for some of you who may have received the previous e-mail
 twice. Our server hiccuped this morning! You should only receive this
 message once.
