 
 Tom, 	
 
 I sat and read your letter and again my heart stopped beating.  My life too has changed forever.  I too will never be able to work HARD for a company believing that my best interest are being considered.  Lets all hope, pray, and believe that one day, some day we are better, stronger people for having learned such hard lessons.  I applaud you for your honesty.				
 
 Sincere Regards,				
 Sandra
