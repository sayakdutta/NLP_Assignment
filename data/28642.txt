 Texas, not the United States (although I understand that our next president 
 is thinking about changing that!)  DF

 In your weekly report, I noted that Martin Allday's deposition is scheduled 
 righ before mine on June 6-7.  I also seem to recall that due to some medical 
 issues, Mr. Allday's deposition will be conducted in Washington DC.  If our 
 lawers and Conoco's lawyers will be in DC, I could just as easily fly to DC 
 vs. Houston for my deposition.  
 
 Is this worth pursuing?????
