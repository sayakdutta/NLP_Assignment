 ALL-
 
 You will all be getting an invitation to a project greentlight meeting.  I would like to get together and discuss the logistics of what the committee will do.  Please think about:
 
 1.  How often we should meet
 2.  How to hold people accountable for projects
 3.  Setting up timelines for where the committee thinks we should be at benchmark times.  (maybe each quarter end)
 4.  Reporting progress to Sally and Rick Buy
 
 I am sure there are many other things which I have left out, which you guys may want to add.  I appreciate everyone' s attention to this project both now and going forward.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Jeff
