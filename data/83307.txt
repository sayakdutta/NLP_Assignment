 Victor, as mentioned, Scott wants to have a one hour meeting on Tuesday (I'll get the room setup) to talk about how he sees the desk operating in this new world. Here is what he wants to cover. 
 
 List of trader responsibilities by pipe and point (Scott will do this)
 List of Logistics responsibilities by pipe (we do this)
 How will the business be different, only pool transactions? (open discussion)
 Talk about IT and short term Park and Loans and how that will be managed (open discussion)
 Emphasis on data collection and pipeline and market intelligience,OFO's, capacity constraints, LDC and other info. (open discussion) 
 
 In addition, Scott really wants to set expectations and some ground rules. Can you get the guys focused on this, have them review and pull the necessary info? Also probably makes sense to spend a few minutes on deal entry so we all hear from the start who is expected to do what. That might be something Clarissa can pull together. 
 
 Tks - Bob
