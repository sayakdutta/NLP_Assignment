 Rob,
 
 Happy New Year!
 
 How have you been doing? Last time when I talked to Blanca after the latest 
 reorg, she said that it hadn't been announced how Southern Cone was going to 
 be. How's it going now?
 
 After nearly 3 years with Enron, I plan to go back to B school. I want to 
 apply for Rice Executive MBA because this will be the most efficient way for 
 me. Besides, I plan to apply two other full-time MBA programs. You have been 
 my supervisor for one year. Although that was my first year with Enron, that 
 assignment was quite important to me. I've learned a lot through that year 
 and later I realize more and more the creativeness and greatness of the Debt 
 Fund. The year with Debt Fund was an important phase of my professional 
 history. May I ask you to be one of my evaluators? As you know, the 
 competition for B school is always hard. A strong recommendation from you, a 
 person in senior management will be crucial for my application. The deadline 
 for Rice is Jan. 15. I'm sorry to give you such a short time. With the other 
 two, I plan to finish them by the end of January or early Feburary. I 
 appreciate it very much if you could spare me some time.
 
 Thank you in advance for your generous help.
 
 
 Regards,
 
 Maggie
