 for Griffith and Calpine, that is why we send those daily schedules.

 Has this been explained to Keith once already? sj
 
  
     
 They had a 35,000 order and Kieth put the setpoint in at the mainline.  They sent a schedule for what they intended to pull hourly and
 he didn't look at it.  I got with him yesterday and explained how the spread sheet works they send us and how to figure the hourly takes 
 for a 24 hr period.  Guess I should'nt assume they know to do that.  I will take the to do to get with each gas controller again and explain
 how Griffith works both at the power plant controls and the mainline.

 What was the problem? sj
 
  

  
 We need to keep our communications open to the plant.  I know that during their test mode they have had a variance in load projections.
 Hopefully when they become operational their loads will be more steady.  
 Ken,
 Sorry about yesterday.  Thanks to your quick responce to our gas control so we could correct the problem before the plant
 went down.  
 If you have any more questions please call.
