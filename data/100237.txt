 Weather is humid and cloudy.  It is suppoded to be hot this weekend.  Mid 80's most days.
 I looked up the weather for Las Vegas also.  It should be perfect.
 I hope the Aladdin has a nice pool area.  Think I will try and set up a massage for sometime Saturday.
 We should try and run sometime Saturday?
 
 I think Julie, Scott and I are on the same flight.
 	Continental flight 1941  leaves Houston 3:40 Pm arrives las Vegas 4:54 PM.
 If you do not want to wait I will meet you at the Hotel.  Carry your cell phone and I will call or you can call me!
 	return flight 1930 leaves Las Vegas 11:43 AM  arrives Houston 4:49 PM
