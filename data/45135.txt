 to give Rick Buy a call so we can straighten this out...

 Tana, my list shows he is with RAC (Corp) so I did not elect him to ENA.  Is 
 he supposed to be ENA?  Deb

 Deb,
 
 Can you check the VP list for Bill.  He was promoted to VP of Enron North 
 America Corp. in January and, looking at the corporate database, his name is 
 not showing up on the list.
 
 Thanks!
