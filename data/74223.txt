 Folks:
 
 I would like to have Chris Calger execute Change Order #2 since it pertains 
 to one of his projects. Is he an authorized signatory under the agency 
 agreement?

 Kay,
 
 Please find attached Change Orders 2 and 3 in which I have removed the dual 
 fuel option as discussed with Lee Johnson and Ben Jacoby in our meeting last 
 Friday.  Please let me know if you need anything additional.
 
 Chris
