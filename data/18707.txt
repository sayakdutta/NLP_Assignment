 
 The meeting between Skilling & the Governor went well.  He's intrigued about 
 the notion of doing an auction for power over the internet.  Governor and his 
 folks are going to do some internal work this week and there's going to be 
 another call next Monday.  Will fill you in as things progress.  Thanks again 
 for the pricing sheet.  Please keep all of this highly confidential.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
