 Robin,
 Don't make the changes to the portfolios yet. We have been looking at these 
 books already- for we need to actually take Enovate out of Agg-gas IV as 
 opposed to adding it in Agg-Gas...
 Lets talk about it before we add these books!
 Thanks,
 Bilal

 Ramesh,
 
 Here is the reconciliation of the portfolios.  The third sheet shows what 
 books need to be added to Agg-gas and what needs to be added to Agg-Gasiv.
 
 Thanks,
 Robin
