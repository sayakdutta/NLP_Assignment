 
 Thanks for your note.  I really enjoyed visiting with you over dinner.  I am 
 so glad to hear that you will be joining us at Enron this summer.  I know 
 that you will find it to be an exciting place.  Please let me know what your 
 start date will be.  I would love to schedule a lunch with you soon after you 
 arrive.  I hope that you will consider me a ready resource for any questions 
 that you have both before you arrive and once you are in the door at Enron.

 	Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to attend the Enron 
 Dinner at Sullivans last Wednesday. Your enthusiasm and energy reaffirmed my 
 decision to come on board with Enron this summer. It was a pleasure meeting 
 you, and I hope we can keep in touch. I am very excited about the opportunity 
 to work at Enron, and I look forward to seeing you this summer. Thanks again.
