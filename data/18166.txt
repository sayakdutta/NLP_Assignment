 FYI:  In caucus today, the Senate Republicans decided to maintain a united
 opposition to SB 28x (Sher) when it comes to the Senate floor tomorrow.
 Their sole argument is against the  unemployment insurance language inserted
 by labor in the Assembly Appropriations Committee. If the bill fails to get
 concurrence in the Assembly amendments, the bill will go to a conference
 committee where this issue (and possibly others) will be hammered-out by
 members of both houses.
