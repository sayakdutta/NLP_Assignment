 But it also appears that what had been (a foreseeable and avoidable) energy crisis, is now by and large a pretty messy state fiscal and political crisis for our good friends in Sacramento, so I don't think that legislators, irrespective of their wishes, can avoid staying involved.
 Add 18XX to the mix and the signing/veto process generally, and, well, Sacramento still seems pretty darned relevant.
 As such, we will have our regularly scheduled call tomorrow at 11:30.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
