 
 I tried logging in to corp, but it failed because it prompted for new 
 hardware - a 3COM card?  Should I get a phone number of one of the 
 technicians, so that I may call them from my house when I try to log in.  
 
 Also, the guys set up a hub for my desktop and laptop.  How do I have the 
 laptop share the printer (which is connected to my desktop)?  Do I use 
 Network Neighborhood?
 
 Thanks,
 Mike
