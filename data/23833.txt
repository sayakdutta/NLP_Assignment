 1.8 Bcf is the average of actual throughput per day.
 
  
     
 That's what I was asking Jan previously - does the 1.8 Bcf/d include any estimates or is that an actual number?
 
 Gina, I am waiting for Steve to respond to two e:mails I've sent him requesting comments on the slide.  He is in Dallas today.
 
  
     
 Thanks!  Should I call an estimate or is this actual?  Also, any changes on the slide I sent yesterday?

 I have 1.8 Bcf/d for annual daily average for total system in 2001 on TW. 
 
  
     
 I'll take an estimate for TW througput per day.  I need something in the next hour, if possible.
 
 Thanks for immediate attention....Gina

 Jan,
 	I had a number from you for one of the presentations we put together, but I wasn't sure if it was the final, actuals for 2001.  What was TW's total actual throughput for 2001?
