 
 New VERY IMPORTANT deal.  I promised parent guarantee requirements and credit and collateral term probobly in the form of an Enfolio by Thursday.  This is a power generator that we do services for in Portland.  Tracy is very familiar with this company and has reviewed their credit.  She should have all the infor you need.  If not let me know.
 
 customer:  Wheelabrator, a subsidiary of Waste Management.  
 

 
 Is there anyway to get this done?  Please let me know so that i can pursue.  Also, can we do physical gas deals under the EEI?  We have an EEI with them.
 
 THANKS,
 
 Kim
