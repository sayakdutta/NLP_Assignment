 Hello to all!
 
 I hope that you are all having a great week!  I know that some of you have
 been asking so I wanted to let you know that I think the big day is finally
 set ( keep your fingers crossed and hope it doesn't rain).  So everyone
 mark March 23, 2002 on your calendar!!!
 
 Have a wonderful day and I will talk to you soon!
 Caycie
