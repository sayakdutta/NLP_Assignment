 Paul/Alan,
 
 We need to have someone check into the legal issues associated with our 
 trading equities in each of the respective countries we are interested in 
 trading.  We need to get rulings on shares, futures and options for both 
 exchange traded and over the counter activity for each country.  This 
 "research" should be performed in much the same way as when we began trading 
 in Australia.  Some of the countries involved may have already been "green 
 lighted" a few years ago.  The countries we need to look into initially are:
 
 Germany
 France
 Italy
 Norway
 Netherlands
 Spain
 United Kingdom
 
 
 Once we get feedback on these countries we should continue on to secondary 
 countries which include:
 
 Austria
 Belgium
 Denmark
 Ireland
 Israel
 Sweden
 Switzerland
 Portugal
 Turkey
 
 
 I will leave up to yourselves to decide where this project should be 
 coordinated from but as we are a US coporate and ECT Investments, the 
 principal booking entity, is a US entity I would imagine it should be handled 
 from the States.  Please let me know if anyone has any questions or would 
 like to discuss issues associated with this request. 
 
 Thanks and regards,
 John
