 Louise,
 
 It looks like someone needs to talk to Jim Fallon for the Research software. Please let me know if you want me to talk to Jim.

 Hello,
 
 I talked to Jim Fallon and he told me not to release any software etc. to NETCO without a formal letter from him.
 
 Please, make sure that we get this request ASAP, so that we can guarantee an orderly transition.
