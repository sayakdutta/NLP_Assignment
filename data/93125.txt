 
 Debbie,
 
 Thank you for returning my call.  I went to the eRequest to submit a request 
 for Risktrac but the only option was to get access to the application.  I 
 already have the application I merely need access to the VAR module.  
 Therefore, I did not submit an eRequest.  Please let me know what I need to 
 submit to ensure I get the proper access.
 
 Thank you,
 Robin
