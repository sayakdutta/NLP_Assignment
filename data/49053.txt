 Vince,
 
 
 this pertains to Chris Hall, about whom Joe H left you a message earlier.
 
 I would not mind talking to you about him and vouching for his 
 qualifications.  The guy is excellent.  He worked for me  (I was the hiring 
 manager) until I left IT a few weeks ago.
 Please give me a call if you would like some input.  His resume follows...
