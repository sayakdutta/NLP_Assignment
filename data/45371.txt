 Susan/Tana,
 
 We have recently traded a deal on Enron Online in which the entity offering 
 the trade was ENA and the entity entering the trade was EPMI Long Term Hedge 
 (Power group hedging with ENA).  This is currently booked as RMT vs. EPMI 
 Long Term Hedge.  Can we send out a confirmation based on ISDA terms since 
 this is an Enron subsidiary per Global Counterparty?  I'm assuming this is 
 just like doing a deal with Enron Global Exploration and Production, EES or 
 ECT International, but let me know if I'm incorrect.
 
 Thanks,
 Joe
