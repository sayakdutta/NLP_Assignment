 You may get the call.  If you need all the units to run tell them to run all the units.  Let me know by voice mail or e:mail if 
 this happens.
 
 Thanks DS

 Randy:  I'm the one for PHFFU issues, and I'll let Dennis volunteer someone for Facility Planning.  The general PHFFU rule is:  if you need it, call Darrell.  We can do the accounting (PHFFU to in-service) after-the-fact if you need to run it.  Call or write any time.  Steve

 FYI	Who do we need to talk to about a future plan regarding volumes through P-3 and the HP that needs to be available?   See note below.

 Our thruput this week at P-3 has been 200mmcf/day. We are running #5 and we have 2,3 and 4 shut down.  #5 is able to move 200mm, but if we lose #5 for whatever reason, 2,3, and 4 together would not be able to make the 200mm order.
 P-2 cannot help us with suction pressure because of the pressure restrictions on the 24" at Canyon, and #1 is in PHFFU and I'm told needs a Major OH if we did take it out of PHFFU.  
 If the 200mm orders continue we may need to take #1 out of PHFFU and have it repaired.
