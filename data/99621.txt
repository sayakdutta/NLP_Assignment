 Today I reviewed NCPA related deals for 11/1-11/6 and found:
 
 11/1 => good
 11/2 => somehow the lightload sale side (deal 517676.1) is only showing HE1-HE6 in the scheduling system now.  I wonder if someone deleted HE23-HE24 afterwards (*on the lightload purchase side we have both HE1-HE6 and HE23-HE24, deal 517673.1).  
 11/3 => good
 11/4 => annuity missing (no power delievered)
 11/5 => annuity missing (no power delievered)
 11/6 => annuity missing (no power delievered)
 
 Please let me know if you could restore the HE23-HE24 for 11/2 back in the scheduling system if they should be there, also please let me know when the missed annuities are entered.  I have also attached my worksheet for your convenient reference.
