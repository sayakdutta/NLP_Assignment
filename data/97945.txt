 George informed me of the pending situation with Peabody and I told him that 
 when I was with Pittston we had a 
 dispute with the NS railroad which hinged upon the fungibility of coking 
 coal. Pittston's chief technical guy was George
 Denton, now retired and , I believe, is available for consultation. George is 
 highly respected and has a vast amount of
 data and experience . Please advise me if you would wish to talk to him.
 
 Thank you
