 
 Attached is the assignment and contribution agreement for your review.  I 
 would like to get your feedback prior to wide circulation. 
 
 Note:  We are still working with EE&CC to put a basic construction agreement 
 in place for assignment to the LLC.  ECS retains payment obligation under the 
 construction agreement even after assignment into the LLC.  Thanks for your 
 help.
