 
 Greetings:
 
 Bowen's aide just called Mona and said that California State Senator Bowen is 
 going to have a hearing on MONDAY in California as a follow-on to the FERC 
 hearing that took place today.  We've been invited to attend.  Focus of 
 hearing:  Repeat of today's hearing, but have it California's house, rather 
 than FERC's.  Based on his Oscar-winning performance at today's hearing, 
 Steve Kean's the one Bowen's office has requested.  
 
 Possible to have a very quick call to get folks' view on the pros and cons of 
 participating in the hearing---recall that Peace sits on Bowen's 
 committee---and whether Steve Kean can be persuaded to come to California?  
 Or perhaps we can send a video-tape of Steve to be played to the Committee?  
 ("You people in California are crazy, but other than that you're a swell 
 group of people.") 
 
 If possible, we would like to have the call at 10 AM (CST)/8 AM (PST).  
 Please let me know if this works for folks.  And if it does work, Ginger 
 could you set up a call-in number?
 
 Best,
 Jeff
