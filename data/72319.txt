 
 Ben/Chris,
 
 Unless something new comes up, I think we finished the letter agreement.  I'm 
 awaiting a revised draft now, and if it is acceptable to NW, they will sign 
 it and fax it to me tomorrow morning.  
 
 Maybe on Ben's layover we can have a discussion about where we go from here 
 from a schedule standpoint.  
 
 Talk to you tomorrow,
 
 Kay
