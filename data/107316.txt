 ECT received a default notice from GSI dated December 3, 2001.  The signature is illegible. There is a path in the upper right hand margin which reads "Draft: (GWN/MJR)
 
 The letter terminates the Prime Brokerage Agreement between ECT and GSI dated "20 August 2000".  As you know, our agreement was dated August 24, 2001.  Can you direct this email to the appropriate GSI person for termination of the appropriate agreement?
 
 Thanks.
