 
 UGH....sorry i missed your call last night.  I can't find your phone number either...i'll give you a call if you email it to me. otherwise, just give me a call later today.
 
  
     
 ok- am really planning on calling tonight.  have to admit, the movies on tv
 the past two nights have sent niki and i into professional veg mode til the
 wee hours....are you going to susan edwards' wedding?  i think we were all
 invited- hate that i'm going to miss it- think it's going to be fun!  first
 night bk to boot camp at almost 100%...not bad, but still stuck in the
 beginner's grp.  looks like a bunch of people who didn't quite make it into
 athletics in jr high....i feel like an olympic athlete in comparison.  won't
 be such an ego boost to head back to advanced grp and last place in every
 wind sprint.  am currently watching old ally mc beal re-runs.  i REALLY like
 that british guy, brian, she dated for a while....damn!  he's precious.  ok-
 mind is wandering.  you'll be VERY excited to hear of my latest whim- cross
 stitching.  but cross stitching w/ a purpose, of course.  M & D's 30th
 anniversary is in december, and thought i'd do an anniversary sampler for
 it.  will prob take me that long just to do the border....ok.  am off.
 again- baring any fabulous , unmissable tv options, will try to call later!
