 Mark,
 
 I am a lawyer with APACHI and as APACHI is winding down, I am looking for 
 other job options at Enron.  Rob Walls advised me to get in touch with you as 
 you may be looking to hire more lawyers.  I would very much like to meet with 
 you at your convenience.  Attached please find a copy of my resume for your 
 information.
