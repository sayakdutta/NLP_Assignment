 Shanna - thanks for the latest version (received this morning) of the bonus / 
 Keysop summary for the coal group.  Everything is correct.
 
 I would like to add my personal thanks for your efforts since you have been 
 handling our group.  It is great to have you on board.  You have added a 
 level of professionalism to our HR effort that is greatly appreciated.
 
 Thanks again,
 
 George
