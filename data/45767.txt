 Shari,
 I sent a copy of a standard short form agreement to encore.  They have sent 
 back comments.  Could you please review and get back to me.  We also need to 
 exchange C$10MM guarantees between Enron & Epcore.
 
 Derek

 Derek, we indicated we were reviewing your short form agreement.  Here are
