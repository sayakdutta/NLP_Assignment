 because I am trying to finish giving performance reviews.  I can make time on 
 Tuesday, but would prefer that we hold this to an hour.  --Sally

 Hello folks -
 
 As we discussed in the initial sponsor meeting, we would like to have a 
 preliminary walkthrough of the ASE Studio Workshop draft agenda.  We are 
 targeting this discussion for either Tuesday or Wednesday morning and will 
 need about 1 to 1 1/2 hours for a thorough review.  Please let me know when 
 you can meet and I will arrange the logistics.
 
 Thanks
 Lisa P
