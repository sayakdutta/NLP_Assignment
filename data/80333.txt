 
 Peter,
 
 Thanks for your voicemail and email.  Your resume is impressive and I have 2 
 thoughts.  Most of our efforts in EGM are not asset related but I would 
 suggest you contact 2 people:  Eric Gonzales for LNG activities and possible 
 construction projects and Rick Bergseiker, Middle East and also co-heads LNG.
 
 Thanks and good luck.
 
 Mike
