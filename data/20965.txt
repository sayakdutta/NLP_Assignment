 FYI...per Brian's question/suggestions I will be implementing a file check 
 out policy procedure for our files that will help control their whereabouts.  
 Starting with the E-schedules and tax files there will be an additional 
 hanging file folder inside the cabinet with sign out forms inside.  Everyone 
 will be expected to govern themselves accordingly for file usage.  Thanks for 
 your cooperation.

 Who has the E-schedules for co. 1n2 and 272?  Marnie is looking for them and 
 the aren't in the file cabinet.  Call me and I'll take them to her.
 
 Thanks.
