 
 Em got the grandparent dinner changed to Wednesday night, so we'll be able to get together tonight.  She's supposed to give me a buzz later and let me know what she would like to do.  Odds are we're looking at a happy hour, followed by a nice dinner and then who knows what. 
 
 Talk to you later,
 Sue
