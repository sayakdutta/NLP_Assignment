 
 Looks like this one is for me to review.  They will be sending these to all 
 of us so that whenever one of us is out, we can let the others know to 
 forward these on to whomever is appropriate.  We're supposed to get back to 
 them within 24 hours.

 Attached below please find language suggested for use for a AECO Daily Price 
 Index for a Balance of Month transaction from Canada. I have reviewed the 
 suggested changes and validated  the pricing language against the Price 
 Source and consider it accurate.

 Dale,
 
 Attached is the revised balance of the month product information.  In the 
 first paragraph, there is a line which needs to be deleted and I have 
 highlighted this line in red.  As well, the second paragraph has two minor 
 changes also highlighted in red.
 
 If you have any questions, please let me know.  Otherwise I would appreciate 
 knowing when this is available so that I can advise Jon McKay.
 
 I have asked Jon about the same day and weekend products and he said he 
 hasn't checked to see if they have been set up.  Once he has, he will let me 
 know and I will then let you know.
 
 Thanks!
 
 Dianne
