 
 Is it possible to pinpoint the sources of the rumors we discussed yesterday?  
 If so, it might be possible to maintain an action against the culprits.  I'm 
 not sure exactly what it might be - possibly for slander or tortious 
 interference with contract, something like that.  I could discuss it with our 
 friend Richard Sanders but it would be a waste of time if we can't identify 
 the perpetrator.
