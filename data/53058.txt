 
 John,
 
 A quick comment about seating arrangements for the weather group. I understand the
 new plan is to put both the gas and power weather guys at one location.
 
 My recommendation is against it. If the objective of having two separate weather
 groups is to put in place a system of checks and balances and encourage independent views,
 the new seating arrangements will nullify it. The power weather guys will 
 defer to Mike who has unquestionable authority and experience.
 
 If we go ahead with the new seating arrangements it makes sense to combine the two groups
 under Mike's leadership.
 
 Please, let me know what you think.
 
 
 Vince
