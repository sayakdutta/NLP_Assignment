What I would really like is a 15 minute download from an appropriate member of the Doorstep Team within a few days of their return from each review.  My goal is to stay informed on an on-going basis, not quarterly or by bunching several of these together.  If there are some concerns, I need to know right away.  Executive management will assume that I am staying informed on a timely basis, and that should be the reality.  The "i's" don't have to be dotted nor the "t's" crossed on the report in order to have this download meeting.  It is also highly likely that someone from the business location that has been doorstepped, will engage in a conversation with me.  I want to be prepared so that I am knowledgeable about the key points from each review, so that I can respond appropriately .  Thanks. --Sally 
 
  
     
 Dear Sally,
 
 As per your request a month or so ago, I've asked the doorstep teams to set up 15 minutes with you to go over their findings.
 
 Best regards

 Please find attached the final doorstep reports for the last few reviews that occurred.  Please let me know if you would like to discuss any of these reports further.  Thanks,
 
 Christy
