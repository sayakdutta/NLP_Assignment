 Carlos Sole.  Bob already contracted for the DC tie line.

 Are either of you familiar with  this project? We have had no contact with 
 the ENA/Enron Mexico commercial or legal people and I don't want to bust any 
 structuring goals.
 
 Our project manager (Scott Laidlaw) and engineer (Harry Okabayashi) want to 
 issue a tasking letter to procure engineering services on this project to 
 support the ENA work. 
 
 I am not in the office today, so please include Renee Alfaro on your response.

 Please clarify if our contractors including engineering services on the 
 Texas-Mexico HVDC project are required to be "off-balance" sheet.
 
 Best Regards,
 Harry Okabayashi
