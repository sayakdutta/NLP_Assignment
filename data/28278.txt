 Today, I received a data request (attached) which provides more specifics on 
 the interviews to be conducted in Omaha. Please note that they have asked to 
 meet with Keith Petersen and Ray Smith on an individual basis.  If the FERC 
 deems it necessary, they will interview individuals that report to them.
