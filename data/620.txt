 My message was confusing.  I needed one more id that has access to all products.  It is for the use of someone on the West Desk.  I do not need an ID that can only trade the West region.  If possible, please modify simtrader7.
 
 Thank you,
 Phillip
 
  
     
 Hi Phillip,
 
 simtrader7 has access to all US gas (physical and financial) and all West power.  Gas access is not regionalized, so I can't give the account access to just West gas.  Let me know if this isn't what you want.
 
 Thanks!

 Jay,
 
 Can you set up one more simulated account with access to all products for the west desk.
 
 Thank you,

 	access to us gas only:	simtrader3, simtrader4
 
 Phillip's accounts are:
 	access to all:		simtrader2
 	access to us gas only:	simtrader5, simtrader6
 
 In each case, the password is the same as the username.
 
 Let me know if you have any questions.
 
 Thanks!
