 
 ok, I was wondering if you came to work today.  I certainly didn't want to!  still sorry to hear about your deal.  I hope things get better!
 
  
     
 You should pay me a visit this afternoon.  You might get a free watch!  come down the stairs and head towards 1oclock adn you will find me in the corner.
 
 BTW, it turns out that the trader was just being an asshole and did not actually transact but was playing games with the structurer and caused the misunderstanding.  Although the result is the same since the trader is suddenly 'no bid'.  I guess he could even be lying about the transaction, but that would be pretty ballsy at this stage.
