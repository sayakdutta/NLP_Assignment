 Paul, I just found out that Jeff Dasovich has been called to a meeting in
 Houston, and will be out all day tomorrow.  He is available on Monday.  Can
 we do our conference call at 0900?  I have asked him to confirm the time.
 I have to leave for Ft Leavenworth at 1030 hrs on Monday, so 0900 works
 well for me.  Hope it works at your end.
 
 Regards,
 Bill
