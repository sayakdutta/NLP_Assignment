 Hey everyone - I am in the process of finalizing a SURPRISE 30th birthday
 PARTY for my lovely wife, Meredith.
 I will get the final info out next week...but just wanted to drop you all a
 note so that you could pencil it in your calendars.
 
 When:  Friday May 31st   8:00ish

        (we will have a private room - with our own DJ -  holding up to 50
 people, so you will be able to sing
                on the small stage or on the big stage in the main bar).
 
 Please feel free to pass the word around, everyones invited ... but
 hopefully we can keep it a surprise for Meredith.
 More details next week.
 
 Thanks, Jim.
