 Hey Susan.
 
 I just got a call from Patricia Ritter which made me realize that we only 
 have 1 month to play all of our games... and with my travel schedule getting 
 booked I thought I should get a start on playing some games.  Are you 
 available anytime soon?
 
 Thursday nights are always out for me as I have school from 6-10.  Next week 
 I will be out of the office Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.  
 
 Let me know.
