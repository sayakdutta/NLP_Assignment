 George, Sally and Shelly,
 
 The attachment is a list of the students who will be coming to Houston and
 be going to both dinner and lunch.
 
 We are looking forward to both dinner and our lunch/office tour of Enron.
 Again, thank you for the effort and support Enron puts forth for our
 program.
 
 George, unless I hear otherwise, we will plan on meeting you and Shelly
 tomorrow night at 8:00 at The Sierra Grill on Montrose. If we are running a
 little late, we will be there shortly.
