 Thank you for your fantastic responses to our reservations request.  There 
 has been some confusion concerning the Dinner Only option.  If you are 
 planning to spend the night, you do not need to respond to that option.  It 
 is listed only for those who do not plan to spend the night.   
 
 We are preparing name tags for all the employees invited to the HPL 
 Anniversary Celebration.  Please email me with the name you would like to 
 appear on your nametag, such as nicknames, etc.   If we do not hear from you 
 by Wednesday, August 2, we will use the name as it appears in the list we 
 acquired from HR.  Please print this memo for any employees who do not have 
 access to email.
 
 Thank you so much for your help.
