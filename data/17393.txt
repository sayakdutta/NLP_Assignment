 Could you please write a very brief synopsis of what took place on the IEP PR 
 call?  Thanks very much.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Paul:  While we've got coverage of the IEPA working group and the Direct 
 Access Coaltion, I think it would be useful to have coverage of both groups 
 PR activities.  I'm not sure if our SF/SaCTO people are already covering 
 this, but if not, maybe Ken can spend some time monitoring their plans etc. 
 
 Today's public affairs call for IEPA is at 1:00 pm PST.  
 
 1800-486-2460
 passcode: 120895
 
 I keep hearing about a Direct Access press conference but have yet to hear 
 details.  Any updates would be useful, and daily/weekly reports on both of 
 these groups would be terrific!
