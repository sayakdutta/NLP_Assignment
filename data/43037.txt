 Stan,
 Attached below are four PAAs for employees in Steve Hotte's organization who 
 worked on the P-Gas project.  Steve discussed these with both you and I.  
 Three of the four are for $3,000 each (the other is for $1,000).  Typically 
 your approval has been requested for PAAs greater than $2,000.  Please reply 
 by email if you approve this request.
