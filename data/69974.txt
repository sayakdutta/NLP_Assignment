 Please spread the word that we're looking for O+ blood donors -- See message 
 below.  The patient is a 23 year old college student who was diagnosed with 
 lukemia last December.  His father is a good friend and former Enron 
 employee.  Thanks very much.

 **************************************************
 Michael has been in and out of the hospital the last 10 days with
 fevers.  They're trying to figure out the cause, and no doubt will do
 so.  In the meantime, he's in need of blood -- some 7-8 units over the
 next couple weeks.  If any of you, your friends, spouses, co-workers,
 etc., have some O+ blood in your system that you wouldn't mind donating,
 I know Michael would welcome it.
 
 Rather than rush down to MD Anderson to donate, please give me a call
 first, and I can give you some of the specifics you'll need.
 
 Thanks.
