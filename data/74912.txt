 
 Good afternoon,
 
 I am circulating a draft of the long term agreement for your review. There 
 are still holes, but hopefully it sets out the basic commercial deal. 
 
 Please note that  we are anticipating a Monday meeting.  Therefore, we have 
 sent this out without the usual internal review.
 
 We hope to have a set of exhibits shortly.
 
 Talk to you soon,
 
 Kay
