 I am missing the following deal:
 1) Enron sells to Powerex MId-C light 3/29 at $140.00
 
 
 Chris Mallory
 Amerex does not recognize deal 563362
 
 
 
 
 BLOOMBERG
 All deals are o.k.
 
 
 
 
 
 PREBON
 
 Chris Mallory
 deal 563461
 Is this a duplicate of 563460 because Prebon only recognizes 1 deal
 
 deal 563358
 Prebon says should be heavy not light hrs.
