 Could you locate, cut and paste and email me the definition of "native load" 
 from the Entergy tariff?
 
 I need the location of the interconnection for the defn of delivery point.
 
 Aren't we missing some time in the defns of On/Off Peak that you gave me.  
 Aren't 2 hours missing?  Is on/off peak an everyday thing, or seasonal?
 
 What are we going to do about defining profit (and costs)?
 
 Do we need to give a place for meetings, and if so, where should these 
 meetings be? (13 c).
 
 More to come...
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
