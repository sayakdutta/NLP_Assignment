 
 The letter looks fine.  I want to make sure that we don't record anything 
 stating the ROW price.  If we need to put it in Exhibit B or something else 
 which is not recorded, let's do so.  Thanks.

 Paragraph 9 would be deleted for the Lonnie Claytor and Jennifer McIntosh
 easements, only.  I changed the letter to reflect that.  Please also note that
 I added a fifth item.
 
 Thanks:

 the
 three landowners in the regarding heading.  I am not clear which easment we
 are
 deleting paragraph 9 on.
