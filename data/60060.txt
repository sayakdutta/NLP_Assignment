 Louise,
 
 As you know, for our NetcoOnline relaunch, we will need the following from UBS ASAP:
 
 1) PA and ETA approval
 2) Agreement on new company name ("Netco" replacement) and new online system name ("NetcoOnline" replacement)
 3) Approval of Press Release
 
 I assume all of these are underway. Please let me know if there is anyone at UBS whom you would like me to chase.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Dave
