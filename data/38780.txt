 
 Group,
 
 Yesterday 11 /11 and this morning  11/12  the ISO cut one of our schedules 
 where Enron was exporting from SP 15, to NOb more specifically the schedule 
 looks like this: CISO-EPMI-SCL. Per Sean Crandall starting tomorrow and 
 forward we will not allow the ISO to cut our schedules UNTIL  all the OTHER 
 nonfirm schedules are cut FIRST. This is made possible by new FTRs that Chris 
 Mallory scheduled on the Sp/NOB path. 
 
 As a result of having firm transmission rights If the ISO calls and cuts one 
 of our schedules at NOB we need to make sure  and ask the ISO that the other 
 nonfirm  schedules are cut first then we can accept our cut. 
 
 For any further questions on this matter contact Sean Crandall or Chris 
 MAllory
 
 thanks
 Monika
