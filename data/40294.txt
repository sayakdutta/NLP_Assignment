 not effecting Cal ISO's return of power because that power is flowing on 
 different transmission, from the Nevada Oregon Border north, not from the 
 California Oregon border North.

  I like the idea alot, and I'll call you later this morning.  In the
 meantime, do we have any idea how much power is being kept in CA by the
 transmission derating?    How much is it affecting the market price in the
 NW?  Is it also affecting CA's ability to return power to BPA pursuant to
 the one-for-two exchange agreement?  I know these are probably tough
 questions to answer, but the staff of NW members will want our best
 estimate.

 From an operational perspective, during a Stage 3 Emergencies, the ISO has
 three options available to keep the lights on.   It can (1) buy more power
 (under its DOE granted Section 202(c) authority), (2) cut scheduled power
 transactions, or (3) derate transmission capacity used to export power from
 its system.  The Cal ISO has recently been derating to zero transmission
 capacity to the Northwest (option 3).  Because transmission users can't get
 capacity to sell their power outside California, the effect is that the ISO
 gets cheaper power over customers in the NW.
 
 I was thinking of a political approach to solving this problem.  I was
 wondering if you could work with your contacts to mobilize NW Senators (?)
 to write a letter to the California ISO and the Governor; you might even
 get Steve Wright to sign on given that this  situation must make it more
 difficult for him to balance his budget.
 
 The central theme of the letter would point out what a hue and cry there
 would be if BPA engaged in such actions and that California is simply
 trying to get cheaper power than the rest of the region.  It could also
 point out that the Cal ISO already has the mechanism of the Secretary of
 Energy's Section 202(c) orders to get the power it needs for an emergency
 and that this order is fairer because it allows market participants to have
 a just and reasonable rate determined (albeit after the fact) for the
 power.  I wouldn't bring up the ISO's authority to cut scheduled power
 transactions.  I don't think we want to encourage that.
 
 What do you think?  Call me.
