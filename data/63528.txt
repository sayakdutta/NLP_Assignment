 Dr. Lay:
 
 We need a bio of you to include in the program for the Herbert J. Davenport
 program on October 13. I have attached the bio of you that we used in the
 brochure announcing the Pinkney C. Walker Endowment. Perhaps, with a few
 adjustments, it will be suitable for this current need.
 
 Please review the bio and send me any changes you would like made as soon as
 possible.
 
 Thank you very much for your prompt attention to this.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Charlie Rahm
