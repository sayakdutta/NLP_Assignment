 I wanted to fix the date on your calendar for the next Energy Committee
 meeting.  From the feedback received, the best date turned out to be January
 23, 2001 although not everyone could make that. The 5:00 to 7:00 PM period
 seemed to work ok last time so we would try this again on January 23, 2001.
 Please mark your calendars accordingly.  We would hope to be getting your
 feedback soon on the specific questions sent out to each of the sub-groups.
 Let us know if you have not received these attachements.  Relative to the
 next meeting agenda, the current thought is as follows:
                           Education sub group discussion output
 30 minutes
                           Seminars/ Forums/etc sub group discussion      30
 minutes
                           Energy Trading Center sub group discussion      30
 minutes
                           Marketing GEMI
          30 minutes
 Would appreciate hearing your thoughts of potential additional agenda items,
 and any initial thoughts you might have on marketing.
 Happy Holidays,
 Lane
