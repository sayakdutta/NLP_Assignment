 
 Drew, here's an excerpt from a FERC letter order accepting for filing a 
 nonconforming agreement filed 
 by Dynegy Midstream...sounds a little bit like what the TW guys are trying to 
 do, if I understand the 
 concept of volumetric rates correctly.  Left a message for my friend at DMP 
 but he (like everyone else)
 is out 'til next year.  But since there were no subsequent orders issued in 
 the docket I assume there were 
 no problems with the filing.
 
 I'm still leaning towards recommending the $0 demand/ $0.02 commodity + file 
 as nego. rate approach.
 If Steve Harris is OK with the idea of doing a deal that requires filing, I 
 will draft something and send it your way.

 The referenced negotiated transaction provides for a transportation service 
 under DMP's Rate Schedule
 FTS. Rather than paying a reservation charge, the negotiated agreement 
 specifies that KGS will pay
 a volumetric rate. The volumetric rate will equal DMP's maximum interruptible 
 transportation service rate as
 set forth in DMP's tariff. . .The contract also (a) specifies five Dth/d as 
 KGS' maximum daily reservation 
 quantity, (b) lists KGS' primary receipt as Meter # 9999999 and (c) 
 identifies five primary delivery points for 
 KGS. . . Upon filing Docket No. RP99-240-000, DMP stated that it agreed to 
 the above negotiated rate so 
 that KGS could serve small residential customers on DMP's system under a firm 
 rate schedule.
