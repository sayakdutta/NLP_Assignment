 The attached file contains the approved capital budget for Enron Pipeline Services Company.  Please note that Dana has indicated that no more than 25% of total capital expenditures should occur in any one calendar quarter and that West Coast expenditures should be deferred until the third quarter of 2001.  If you have any questions, please contact me.
