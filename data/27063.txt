 I tried calling you last week and heard you were out.
 
 I am in Houston until mid-Feb and then who nows.....  do you want to catch-up for a coffee some time this week?

 So,  you waited until the weather became bearable before coming to Houston?   Good call there.
 I travelled to Portland a week ago to visit friends.    Deb and I had a great time and the flight was so cheap,  $165.       The weather was awesome and the wine was good 
 (  as far as I can remember ).    
 Anyway,  it was good to see Stewie, Tim and even Richter.    
 
 What are you working on here,  is it classified?
