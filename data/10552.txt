 I would recommend that we call our major customers and let them know the change as well.

 I don't this we give our customers lockbox instructions any longer.  Invoices cite wire instructions and physical address.  Raetta please confirm.

 Lockbox should still stay bank of america.  I  am working with Treasury to make sure that these accounts stay open for the next 10 days.
 
  
     
 Rod,
 
 Attached are revised wire transfer instructions for company 60 and 179
 
 Companies 62 and 370 should remain unchanged
 
 Thanks
