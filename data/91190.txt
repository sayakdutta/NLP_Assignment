 
 Purvi,
 
 Glad to see you working on some good stuff : )
 
 you need to pull out a black sholes calculation and input the varialbles that you were given
 and then call a power options trader to ask for a marekt to check the resonableness of the model
 models can be way off on options due to skew and market conditions
 
 good luck
 
  
     
 I have this little project to do and i need a little help from you... (since you are an expert in this field!!)
 
 ok-- i need to figure out what the premium is on an aug on- peak call option for power. Now , I know that power is not what you do, but I can use some ideas on how to get started.
 
 Terms
 
 Strike price  is $200/ MWH
 Forward curve for Aug is $125/MWH
 Aug 2001
 Foward Volatility of 100%
 Valuation Date is June 8, 2001
 Interest Rate is 6%
 On- Peak Call Option for 50 MW
 
 SO far, I have looked at some forcasts for Aug, and seen which hours the market rate is above 200 to come up with a premium value.  I have an answer for this problem, but I was just curous as to see where you would start. Anything will work. Thanks!!

 P.S-- also, don't be hesitant to tell me that you have no clue--- You'll still be my favorite manager!!!
