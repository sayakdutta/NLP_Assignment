 	catching a plane to Minneapolis that afternoon.  Just let us know where and when.
 	We look forward to seeing you guys Thursday.  Have a good week.  Thanks. Lynn

 Lynn & Steve,
    How about next Thursday for lunch?  If that day works, we will call you
 Thursday morning about where and when (obviously, we retirees have a pretty
 tight schedule).
    It'll be great to see you.  Look forwarding to getting caught up!
    Take care,
        Julia & dave
