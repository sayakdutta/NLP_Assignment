 
 Of course your Dad would be invited to anything we do, but if you'd rather 
 spend the
 time alone with him that weekend we could always make it another weekend.  
 The only
 problem with the 12th is that we'll be consumed with the move the entire 
 weekend.  Let
 me know what works for you.  We're flexible after the 12th.
