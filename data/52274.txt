 
 Brian,
 
 What about drinks after work on Friday? 
 
 There is a festival of Polish films and you
 are welcomed to join us later on Friday at 7:00
 at the Angelica Movie Center.
 

 I am off to Atlanta tonight.
 
 Vince
 
 
 
  
     
 I can be there with a smile.
 
  
     
 Brian,
 
 What about the weekend?
 I am in Atlanta Thursday.

 If you are in need of a companion for an alcohol infusion, I stand ready to oblige.
