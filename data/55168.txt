 It looks  great. It's a very nice design.

 Vince:
 
 I have attached the general design we are proposing for the Enron Seminar
 Series mug.  We have a little refinement to do - spacing here and there a
 couple type-o's but this is the idea.  If you like it, we will put an order 
 in.
 
 I'll put out an announcement on the seminar schedule shortly.  So far the
 fall line up includes Will Goetzman - Yale, Lenard Mirman - Virgina, Jeff
 Pontiff - U. of Washington, George Allyannis - Darden, and Charles Lee -
 Cornell.
 
 Thank you.
