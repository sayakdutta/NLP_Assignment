 
 do you want the ticket?   i got this ticket from a broker - it is going for like $600 now
 

 and let me know
 
 
 
     
 
 i bought a plane ticket last night.  i was waiting to
 make sure that texas and ou were undefeated to buy it.
  what sucks is that the tickets to dallas were like
 600 dollars and to austin were 190 so i'm going to
 austin friday morning and driving up with all my
 friends.  the drive there is great but the drive back
 sucks kak.
