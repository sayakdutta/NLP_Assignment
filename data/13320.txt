 
 I would suggest working through Sheila Knudsen and the Compensation Council 
 to get this done Enron-wide.  Let me know if that isn't successful.  Thanks.

 What is your suggestion regarding disseminating the message to all other 
 Enron Companies that part-time employees from the staff level on up (all 
 exempt positions) should be paid on a salaried basis?   I could use your 
 input on this.    I called Brian Schaeffer approx. 1 month ago and he said he 
 was aware of the situation and that changes were going to be made but, I've 
 not heard anything about how the message is being communicated to other Enron 
 companies.
