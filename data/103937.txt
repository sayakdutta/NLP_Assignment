 
 David:  I am inquiring to see if you would be available for a short 
 conference call tomorrow with a few credit related items.  I cannot recall 
 the exact time difference between Houston and Geneva, but I can contact you 
 at 9 am Houston time (or later as you wish).  I have your phone number as 
 4122 3221111.  Please advise.  Regards.  Sara
