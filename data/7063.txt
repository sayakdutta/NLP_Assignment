 Hey,
 
 After speaking with Reagan in origination, we thought it would be a good idea to evaluate the status of New Transmission Agreements project.
 
 If it pleases all, let's all get together from 10:00 to 10:30 on Tuesday Jan. 29.
 
 If you have any questions or timing conflicts give me a shout.
