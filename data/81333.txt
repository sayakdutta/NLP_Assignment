 The file you sent me is exactly the type of spread sheet I needed.  Thank You.   However, I was wondering if you could get access (via that file) to a few other points.  Specifically, I am in need of Gas Daily Curves for NGI-Chicago, GDM-Dawn,GDM-Niagara, and GD-Hehub.  And with respect to basis curves, I am in need of a curve for Niagara and Columbia Gulf.
 
 If you could point me in the right direction I would really appreciate it.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Jon
