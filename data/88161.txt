 
 I wanted to let  you know I am currently negotiating two Master Gas 
 Agreements with TransCanada for the two entities listed above.  As previously 
 discussed, credit suggests increasing  TransCanada Pipelines Ltd.'s  guaranty 
 to $50MM and decreasing Enron's to the same amount.    Have you discussed 
 TransCanada's guaranty?    Is $50MM large enough to cover your agreement? 
 
 Veronica Espinoza(66002) in credit is working with me on guaranty issues.   
 Finally, did you receive copies of Enron's and TransCanads's guaranty?  If  
 not, let me know I will fax same.  Their guaranty expires the end of this 
 month.
