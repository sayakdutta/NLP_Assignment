 
 I just talked to Bob, and I don't know if he's responded yet, but I thought 
 I'd fill you in anyway. He's been talking to his contact at Constellation 
 about changing these deals over, but hasn't received a concrete answer yet. 
 I've reminded him and he said he WILL talk to the guy and resolve it today. 
 I'll keep on it, and let you know when these deals have been changed.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate

 Hello, I hate to bug you with this.  Whenever you can spare a second would 
 you ask Bob about this?  I am afraid it is going to slip through the cracks.
 
 Thanks for your help!

 Hi Bob, I was wondering if you have contacted Constellation about the 6 
 trades that are in the system with the Cal Px as the index price.  All of 
 these trades start flowing in July of this year.
 
 The deal numbers are as follows:
 
 453152.01
 453175.01
 453294.01
 462109.01
 471888.01
 471889.01
 
 Let me know if Constellation agrees to change these deals to the Dow Jones so 
 I can send a letter for them to sign.
 
 Thanks,
 Melissa
