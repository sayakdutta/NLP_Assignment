 Jeff,
 John White has proposed to the CEERT Board that we send the attached letter to the Governor attacking the DWR contracts. Would you please take a look at it and let me know what you think of it.  You can reach me on my cell phone at 213-359-0853. Thanks.
 Hap

 the letter sent earlier this week regarding CDWR power contracts.  Please
 review and respond with comments as soon as possible.  A discussion of
 CEERT's plan of action will be scheduled shortly.
 
 Thank you,
