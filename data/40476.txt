 
 I assume you didn't see this because of the fire wall, so I'm resending.

 Jay--Couple notes:
 
 FERC has stated in several orders what it considers "material changes".  You 
 may want to look at Duke and Consumers procedures to make sure you are Ok 
 with the interpretations.  Those are some of the orders that I would look to 
 should a utility try to kick an Enron project out of the queue for a change.
 
 Also, per your comments on No. 16.  I agree with you on "commenced 
 construction."  What I mean by "commenced" includes the utility purchase of 
 easements, etc.  I just want to make sure that the Customer is not agreeing 
 to live with the FERC outcome, unless the Customer tells the utility to 
 proceed and agrees to be bound by FERC's decision and agrees to pay the 
 costs.  [[Customer may want to wait to proceed until it sees the FERC 
 decision.]]  Thanks.
 
 
 
    
  
 Please let me know if you have any feedback to Jay's suggested approach to the
 Generation Interconnection Procedures section of the tariff.  I don't want to
 file this until I hear that you are in agreement.

 Mary, Christi.
 
 Thanks for your good comments on the draft interconnection procedures.
 Attached is a memo addressing your comments.
 
 Michele Farrell will have the pen to make the changes and to supervise the 
 filing while I'm out this week.
 
 
 Jay.

 I agree with Dave.  I'd agrue for 120 if I thought I could get away with it.

 Frankly, I am more comfortable with 90 days.  Its easier to complete a 
 project early and send out the info prior to the due date, then to have to go 
 back and ask for more time.  Depending on the size of the plant and location, 
 we may be faced with a lot of checking equipment records and field checks to 
 verify ratings.  I'll ask Gary Lindland how he feels about reducing the time 
 line.

 Any feedback on Enron's comments on our draft interconnection procedures that 
 Jay sent out last night?  Jay and I are trying to get the DC attorneys on the 
 phone to incorporate some changes.  In particular, Enron wants us to put in a 
 shorter time for completing the Interconnection Facilities study (60 rather 
 than 90 days).  Enron says we would still have the flexibility to take longer 
 if we notify the customer that we need more time.  How do Dave and Jim feel 
 about that proposal?
