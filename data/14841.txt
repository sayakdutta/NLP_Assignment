But, I would like to dispel the suggestion that Jerry put together the spreadsheet for me.  I'm very enthusiastic about the AR tools that Jerry & Jim have developed and I'm happy that the reports seem to also serve the needs of the finance folks, but I feel like I made it clear that the customer service reps (like Marion) that are on the front line of collecting monies are the main clients of Jerry's reports.   If the tool needs to be modified to better meet their needs -- then it should be modified.  I'm all for automation and less manual intervention.
 
 
  
     
 
 Shelley--If you have time on your schedule, would you also attend this meeting.  The reason I've scheduled this meeting is to determine exactly what it is John Keiser needs for cash flow analysis and what we can do to automate Jerry's process such that it doesn't require so much manual intervention and is more dependable.  (Marion spends too much time reconciling to Jerry's spreadsheet when she needs to be contacting customers for collections.)  I believe Jerry put this together for you, so your thoughts would be appreciated.  Sheila  (We're meeting in EB3907 at 2:30 pm.)
