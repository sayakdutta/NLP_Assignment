 A few items to follow up with:
 
 (1)  I understand that you are finalizing the Enron Corp. guaranty with 
 Clement Abrams.  Please let me know when all is agreed and I will arrange 
 with Clem for an executed guaranty.
 
 (2)  Stephanie Panus will fax to you the power of attorney for EEFT to act 
 for ECTRIC.  The acronyms will be obvious in the fax.  
 
 (3)  Euros are fine for Termination and Contractual Currency.
 
 (4)  I am considering your proposed certificate in lieu of a board resolution 
 and checking your tax rep.
 
 I will be out of the office Dec. 7 & 8.  You can contact Stephanie Panus in 
 my absence.
 
 Regards.  Sara
