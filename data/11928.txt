 Larry,
 
 I received this email message from Leslie this afternoon... she asked if I
 had received the letter from her that approved TW's request to discontinue
 the groundwater monitoring at the Puckett site.
 
 She may have asked this because she may have expected to receive an annual
 report last week.
 
 Last week, I sent to you a draft of what I thought should go into the new
 annual reports, now that we don't have any groundwater monitoring to report.
 
 Please let me know if you want me to send an annual report to her.
 
 Later,
 James
 
 
     
 James - did you get letter?
 Thanks
 leslie
