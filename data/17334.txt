 Kim:  
 
 Been having horrible computer problems.  (Just got switched over to Windows 
 2000---I hate Microsoft; break it up into a million itty bitty pieces.)  
 
 Haven't had a chance to read what you wrote.  Attaching what I cobbled 
 together yesterday.  Will also take a look at what Mr. Jackson put together.  
 You should feel free to go ahead and meld mine and yours, etc.  I'm at work.  
 Will be here until  about 11-11:30.  After that, if you need me, page me at 
 888.916.7184.  And thanks a million for pulling it together.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
