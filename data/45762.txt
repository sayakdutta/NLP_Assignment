 Directors of the Company appointing the individual(s) as agents and 
 attorneys-in-fact.  Do you sugguest I proceed this way or via the Power of 
 Attorney below?

 Hi Mark and Tana
 
 I have been given your name by Justin Boyd as someone who can help me or 
 point me in the right direction.
 
 We need to raise a power of attorney to enable Amita Gosalia of Enron House 
 to execute EnronOnline Password Applications for each of the above company.  
 Please could you let me know if you can prepare such a document and also what 
 if any additional information you require.  I have attached a copy of the 
 Power of Attorney which we use in the UK for such authority for your 
 information.
 
 
 
 Unfortunately this is becoming quite urgent and any assistance you can give 
 will be greatly appreciated.
 
 Please let me know if you have any queries.
 
 Thanks and regards
