 Just wanted to check and see how you're doing these days.  I was offered a job with Cascade Natural Gas in Seattle this past week.  The salary is okay and the location is, of course, desirable but I'm just not completely sure about the job.  I have a while to make the decision.  They wanted an answer today, but I played hard-ball and told them I had to have more time (so silly, but it's very hard for me to do).  In the meantime, I'm exploring every contact I can come up with.  Anyways, you never got back to me and gave me any sort of idea about what your plans are post-school.  I'm very curious to know what you're thinking on that front.  Drop me a line when you get a chance.
 
 Susan
