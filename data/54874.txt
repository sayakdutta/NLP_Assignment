 
 Molly,
 
 I met Lou in the building lobby last Wednesday and he suggested that he
 (or his representatives) join the Mathworks presentation to my group).
 
 It's a good software package for mathematical modeling,
  but there is a limit to the number of different installations any group
 can productively use.
 
 I shall take a look at some new features they offer
 and decide whether it's worth the effort.

 Do you know this person or this company?  They are want to set an appointment 
 with EBS and I believe, are wanting to meet with you, also.  Any feedback?  
 Thanks.

 Hello Mr. Casari:
 
 Myself and our Energy Trading Financial Team will be visiting with the R&D
 group at Enron the week of 10/16/00.  They have several applications can be
 dramatically improved with our tools.
 
 We are very interested to understand the Bandwidth Trading Market, to see
 if any additional challanges can be overcome with our tools. 
 
 I would like to understand your challanges of modeling, simulating and
 deploying applications to control risk.
 
 Are you available to discuss these items prior to our visit?
 
 I look forward to hearing from you.
 Thanks
 Scott Wakefield
