 Reagan struck all the references to the Fuel Plan.  
 
 I think the specific obligations would fit nicely in the scope exhibits, but 
 we can put the stuff in the body of the contract if that's better for you.  
 It just seemed that it would easier to work  with in the exhibits.

 Kay -- Do you want detail about our specific power and gas activity 
 obligations in the body of the contract, or in the Marketing Plan?  Is the 
 fuel plan included in the Marketing Plan?
