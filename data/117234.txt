 financials, the Credit Group has a form they can send out without legal 
 review.  If there is more to it than that, you may want to check with the 
 paralegals and see what is in the current form bank.

 Do we have a Confidentiality Agreement Template we start with for financial 
 derivative counterparties?  If we do, where do we keep it?  Thanks.
