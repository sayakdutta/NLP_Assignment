 Happy New Year!  Just a note to announce the dates for this years Texas
 Finance Festival.  This year we are meeting earlier in April, in San
 Antonio, and start the program on Friday. Please put the date on you
 calendar and send in your registration forms ASAP as space at the
 conference is limited.  I also encourage you to register with the hotel
 immediately as we were able to reserve only a limited number of rooms at
 the reduced conference rate.
 
 Hope to see you all there!  More fun in Texas.
