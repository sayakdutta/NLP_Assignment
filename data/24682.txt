 Hi, Chris,
 
 I am just wondering if you had received my fax from last week regarding the
 Power of Attorney form (Form 2848).
 
 Friday, Oct. 5th will be my last day at PwC, and I just wanted to follow-up
 with you on this matter before I leave.  If you do not get a chance to fax
 the form back to me before then, or if you have any other concerns, please

 happy to assist you.
 
 Best regards,
 
 Vicki Meszaros
