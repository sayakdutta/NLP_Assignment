 
 Dale,
 
 Ed Gottlob would like to set up a meeting with all of the necessary 
 counterparties in order to discuss this product.  Can you find out when a 
 good time would be?
 
 
 Thanks,
 
 Eric

 Eric -
 
 Logistics is telling us that this product is not presently traded OTC. The 
 Sitara group is telling us that we don't presently have the ability to 
 support this product, which is probaby a result of the fact that is is 
 unprecedented. 
 To my knowledge EOL doesn't have the ability to eliminate specific dates 
 between the Start Date and End Date.
 
 David, essentially this product would be a calendar month long US Phys Gas 
 contract where we DO NOT move gas on the weekends. 
 
 Can we chat about this please.

 Dale,
 
 Have you heard anything more on the 5 X 24s?  We would like to get this 
 product out ASAP.
 
 
 Thanks,
