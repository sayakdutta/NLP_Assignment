 Last night Marvin Carraway, General Manager of Clarksdale Public Utilities, 
 presented our LOI to his board.  They approved it, and he signed it.  
 Thursday night Bob Priest, General Manager of Yazoo City Public Utilities, 
 will present to his board and sign it as well.  The two cities formed a joint 
 action agency called Mississippi Delta Electric Agency (MDEA).  
 
 Everyone should have received the LOI via email on Monday.  Let me know if 
 you didn't.
 
 We need to have MDEA functional by May 1 to coincide with their exit from the 
 Municipal Electric Agency of Mississippi (MEAM).  David Fairley and I are 
 planning to visit Clarksdale and Yazoo City Monday and Tuesday to talk with 
 them about all the activiy that is about to start up.
 
 In order to identify and coordinate all of this, we would like to have a team 
 meeting.  If I left anyone off of the distribution list, please have them 
 attend, and I'll get them added.
 
 Time:   11.30 am Thursday morning (3/29/01)
 Duration: We have the room for 2 hours
 Place:  EB3321
 Food:  Lunch provided
 
 I am pulling together an agenda/list of known issues and will email out later 
 today.  If I don't get to everyone before then, send any ideas/issues to me 
 by email.
 
 Thanks,
