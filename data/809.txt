 
 Bob,
 
 Let me know how I can help with the variance application.
 
 Phillip
 
  
     
 Phillip,
 
 It is looking like we will have to apply for a variance due to a set back
 requirement when building over 10 feet tall.  Normal set back is 10 feet.
 For every 3 ft higher you go, another 5 feet is added to the set back.  The
 garage would be about 20 ft so we'd normally need to be back about 25 ft.
 Currently, it's 13 feet.
 
 I'm going to look into what's involved in getting on the agenda for a
 variance.  I'll let you know what I find out.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Bob Huntley
