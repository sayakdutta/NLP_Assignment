 already the property of ENA) into Netco like we have the rest of the softwa=
 re/hardware critical to the trading organization.   The payable is sunk and=
  should be left with the estate.

 See the below.  Do you still want to transfer the hardware and software?  A=
 lso, I would assume that Netco would assume the $1.5 million payable.  Shou=
 ld the memberships be assigned, if assignable?

 I have been told that all control area agreements have lapsed and are no lo=
 nger in effect.  Per David Portz, there are still in existence memberships =
 with regional authorities (you pay dues and you get to vote) which he says =
 will lapse when the regional authorities determine that Enron no longer con=
 trols any load.  Also, there are items of software and hardware used by Enr=
 on-SE Corp., which would be transferred to Netco.  I do not think that the =
 hardware and software is owned by Enron-SE, since purportedly the only asse=
 t showing on the books of Enron-SE is a receivable of $1,218 from ENA.  The=
  software and hardware was purchased from ESCA and $1.5 million is still ow=
 ed.  David Portz thought that EPMI or ENA actually purchased the hardware a=
 nd software (and I think probably still owns it).  I am attempting to ascer=
 tain ownership from accounting.  Based on these facts, it does not appear t=
 hat there is any great benefit to the estate in keeping the hardware and so=
 ftware.  Further, the outstanding payable of $1.5 could be transferred to N=
 etco.
