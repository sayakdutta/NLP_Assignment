 
 Bill,
 Yes, one of the options I am looking at.
 
 Vince
 
  
     
  Have you considered joining a consultancy?
 
 
     
 Bill,
 
 Lacima is relatively small, but they have two very competent
 and experienced principals: Chris Strickland and Les Clewlow.
 
 I am looking right now at a number of options. Hopefully, I shall make a
 decision
 within a few weeks.
 
 Vince
 
 
 
     
                 
     Have you developed plans?  I'd be interested in your evaluation of
    Lakima
    Group, whom I believe you've worked with.  How big are they?
 
    
                 
    Bill,
 
    Delayed congratulations.
 
    Vince
 
        
                             
       Hi Vince -
       Its very sad to see what has happened.  I hope you are doing OK
 under
       the
       circumstances.  I wanted also to let you know that I'm
 transitioning
    to
       an
       advisory role at Opt4  since they are now in a more operational
 mode,
       rather
       than developmental.  I've joined Charles River Associates in the
 Palo
       Alto
       office. What are your plans for the future?  I would like to
 extend
    an
       invitation to get to know us better, and perhaps to collaborate if
    our
       interests coincide.  When do you get back from vacation?
 
 
       Bill Balson
       Vice President
       Charles River Associates
       285 Hamilton Avenue
       Palo Alto, CA 94301
