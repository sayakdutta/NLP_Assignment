 Lee,
 
 I've notified Ben Jacoby who will be responsible for formal notification
 from ENA to proceed on the additional dual fuel units.  I'm relatively
 certain that ENA wants to proceed with these, and I've advised them that GE
 needs the answer this week--by Friday.
 
 Tell David to expect to hear from Ben shortly.
 
 Thanks!
 
 Mike
