 Attached is a form of Letter in Lieu that is being used in connection with
 the Statex loan transaction.  You may wish to use the basic form as an
 attachment to the Master Agreement to allow International Bank of Commerce
 ("IBC") to request assignment/payment of any proceeds payable to Statex
 under any hedge contracts, directly to IBC.  Please call if you have any
 questions.
