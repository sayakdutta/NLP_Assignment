 I have to give the Broker a tentative number on the 12th.  I will let you know what kind of count I have at that point.  I've put down $500 as a deposit and the remainder will be put on someone's card.  
 
 As far as the cost, it's approximately $100/person, depending on how much we drink.  I can either figure a total for your group prior to the evening or wait until the final bill is determined and invoice you for the relative cost.
 
 However you want to work it is fine with me.
 
  
     
 Do you have an estimate for the cost for the Christmas Party?  Dow you want to split it pro-rata based upon headcount?
