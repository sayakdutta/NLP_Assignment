 How do we participate in the CEPI?  Are we providing prices to them?

 Dow Jones will this month launch a new power index, known as the Central 
 European Power Index (CEPI). The participating companies include Enron, 
 PreussenElektra, Electrabel and VASA. The delivery point will be a point on 
 the PreussenElektra grid.
 
 CEPI is the second Central European index to be introduced by Dow Jones, the 
 first being SWEP.
