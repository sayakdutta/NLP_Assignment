 
 The first facility agreement which needs to be finished is the ESA Facility 
 Agreement.  Peter and/or Chris, could you please send/re-send the most recent 
 version with a email stating any open issues, copying everyone on this 
 email.  We need to get this one ready to sign tomorrow, if at all possible.
 
 My understanding of the commercial deal is that the scope should include 
 change order #3, with 75% of the value of change order #3 payable on or 
 before Dec. 27, 2000, and 25% of change order #3 being added to the January, 
 2000 payment.
 
 Kent/Lee, sorry I didn't mention this in our phone call this afternoon. 
 That's what happens when I'm not working from my list.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
