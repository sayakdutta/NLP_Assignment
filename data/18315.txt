 Well, I ended up traveling ALL week, which I wasn't happy about.  Worse, some 
 nimrod Enron IT person in Houston (where I was for part of the time) deleted 
 my entire *&$*(!*-ing hard disk (which stupidly, I hadn't backed up)---year's 
 worth of work and school gone, kaputt.  Anyway, if there's any chance that 
 someone has all of the cases that we did and could email them to me, I would 
 be greatly indebted.  Sorry for the inconvenience, and see you on Monday.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
