 
 Ron,
 
 We are really swamped and I would like to keep our involvement in
 conferences to a reasonable minimum. I can promise that we shall help you
 with a future conference if it happens to be in Houston.

  Volatility"
       program
 
 
 
 Hi Vince,
 
 I would like to invite you, or one of your staff, to be a speaker at
 Infocast's upcoming conference "Market Price Volatility: How to Model,
 Assess, and Manage Price Volatility in Today's Power Markets," scheduled for
 May 10-12, 2000, in Chicago.  I am attaching a copy of the draft program
 agenda for your review.  As you may note, we wish to take our recent Houston
 meeting a step farther by making this next session a more
 technically-oriented meeting.
 
 There are two spots you may wish to consider:
 
 1. The session entitled "Case Study in Modeling Volatility," scheduled for
 Wednesday, May 10th, from 3:30 to 5:00 pm.  You will note below, what we had
 in mind for the case study.
 2. The talk "A Real Options Approach to Asset Valuation," scheduled for
 Thursday, May 11th, from 10:30 am to 12:00 pm.
 
 I am running behind schedule in finalizing this program, so I will give you
 a call shortly to follow up with you.  If you wish, please feel free to call
 me at 818-888-4445 ext. 28.
 
 I hope you can join us.

 CASE STUDY GUIDELINES
 1.   Model should be for a particular market. Examples: PJM, Chicago, ECAR,
 Southern California.
 
 1B (optional). Model should be for a particular purpose. Examples: valuing a
 new combustion turbine at the Florida/Georgia border, bidding on a portfolio
 of power plants up for sale in NEPOOL, valuing a retail portfolio in
 Pennsylvania.
 2.   Model should be estimated on a particular data set. Examples: daily
 NYMEX
 close prices for Palo Verde, PJM hourly spot prices for 1998-1999.
 3.   Case study should describe several candidate models, for volatility
 and/or market price, that were considered. Case study should discuss why
 these models were considered. Candidate models should be described
 mathematically and verbally.
 4.   Evaluation criteria for choosing among the models should be explicitly
 identified, and quantified to the extent possible. Examples of evaluation
 criteria: residuals that are not autorcorrelated, stationarity, R-squared,
 Akaike information criterion.
 5.   Parameter estimates for each candidate model should be displayed. The
 estimation procedure employed should be briefly described.
 6.   Some diagnostics of model fit (vis-a-vis data set) should be presented.
 7.   If possible, predictive power of model should be assessed.
 
 Generally, the case study should include all of the items above. The case
 study may include other things.
