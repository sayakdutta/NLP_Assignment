 Sheila:  Thanks for the message.  I spoke with Mike Schneider (who contacted 
 me - he's at 212-648-1164) to confirm our agreement and wanted to let you 
 know that he was apologetic for having not having "better rates" to charge 
 ENA.  He said he's been after Enron's business for some time and hopes to 
 reduce rates in the course of business, if possible.  I thought you might 
 want to have this bit of information.  Regards.  Sara

 Theresa and Greg,
 The rates from JP Morgan for the Futures account appear to be competitive 
 (acutally better) than the terms for our other current agreements.
 With 90 day t bill at 4.41%, 90% of this is 3.969% on the credit side vs 4.16 
 using JP morgan's less 25 bp.
 On the debit side it is competitive.  
 Therefore, I am okay with the rate schedule from JP morgan and we can go 
 ahead unless anyone can see an objection.
 Thanks. Sheila

 US Dollars 90 day US TBill auction rate less 0.25%  JP Morgan Overnight 
 Borrowing Rate plus 0.25 %
