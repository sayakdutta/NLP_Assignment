 since lost but I still think it's a good move.  Hopefully there will not be 
 any more financial pre-announcements so the focus will quickly shift towards 
 the future lower interest rate environment instead of the mediocre past.
 
  I am now completely out Intel and did trim some other.  I'm pretty balanced 
 now between financials, tech, drugs, energy, and consumer (WMT).
 
 ENE closing at $72+!!!!!
