 Carol, 
 The west desk is presently working on a deal to serve a large industrial 
 customer, Knauf,  newly located within the franchise area of a tiny northern 
 California municipality, The City of Shasta Lake.  It makes sense to do a 
 price swap with Knauf.  Our champion, Laird Dyer, says that Knauf wants to do 
 an ISDA.  This would be a perfect situation for you, with your ISDA 
 background, to help me, (working on the corresponding physical piece with the 
 City of Shasta) to team up and help us get this deal done.  Can you help us 
 in this manner?  ----cgy  
 
  
    Cc: Rosman, Stewart; Sacks, Edward
  
 Christian,
 
 Can you please forward the ISDA to Jeff Brown at Knauf Fiber Glass G m b H.  

 
 His address & phone number is:
 
 One Knauf Drive,
 Shelbyville, IN 46176
 
 Phone:  317.398.4434 ext:  8402
 fax:  317.392.3891
 
 Thanks,
 
 Laird
