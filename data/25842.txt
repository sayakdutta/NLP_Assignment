 Daren,
 
 I've just received word from Basin to bring production on sometime today or 
 tomorrow (they expect to get up to b/t 10,000-15,000d); if our facility 
 planning engineer determines that we can take the gas, then it will flow for 
 all of February and be priced at 100% Gas Daily less $0.16.

 I need for you, or the Producer Services group, to determine if you think the 
 gas will flow for the month and at what price.  I will use your decision for 
 our bidweek postion.

 FYI,
 
 How would you want to handle for February nomination?

 I have reviewed the gas composition analysis from SPL of the Basin production 
 from GA 213.  While SPL's analysis does show a dewpoint of around 20 degrees 
 F at 400 psig, it is both my and John Handley's opinion that the gas from the 
 wellbore had stratified by the time that this sample was taken.  We expect 
 the dewpoint of the flowing gas to be higher.  However, this was the best 
 sample that could be obtained at the time.  We have conferred with Steve 
 Schneider and we are willing to take this gas on a conditional basis over the 
 next couple of days.  Once the 6" line has been pigged, the production flows 
 stablilized and Mitchell's conditioning equipment lined out over the next 
 couple of days, HMS will need to take another sample at the meter run and 
 have SPL run an extended analysis with a dewpoint curve on an expedited 
 basis.  Should this sample indicate a dewpoint over 45 degrees F, then this 
 production will be shut in again until hydrocarbon dewpoint conditioning 
 equipment has been installed.  In the meantime, HMS needs to keep a close 
 watch on all Southern Union city gates on Galveston Island to monitor for 
 liquids fallout.
