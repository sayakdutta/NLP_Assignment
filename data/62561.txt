 We are in the initial stages of developing a commercial outsourcing proposal for Total, CMS and Reliant Energy in Argentina. I will be in Houston next week and wanted to get a down load on the most applicable outsourcing structures that have been concluded or that Enron has experience with. Could you let me know who would be the appropriate person to get in touch with. 
 
 The Total transaction is the most comprehensive and would involve management of the power commodity, gas commodity, gas capacity and operations and scheduling as being envisioned now.
 
 
 
 Please let me know your thoughts.
