 
 Per our conversation, attached is the form of ISDA Agreement, with Enron 
 guaranty attached to it.  As we discussed, Cadwalader will issue an 
 enforceability opinion with respect to the Enron Corp. guaranty, so we need 
 to provide them with an opinion with respect to Enron Corp. general corporate 
 matters.
 
 Thanks for your help!
