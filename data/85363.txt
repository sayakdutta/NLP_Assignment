 Eric and the smoke hanging out of his mouth will be distributed to ALL ENRON 
 EMPLOYEES.

 I probably don't need to mention this to you, but I'm trusting that you won't 
 send "shot" picture to ANYONE.  I thought you might get a chuckle out of it, 
 and it was fun that night, but I would die if some of the more straight-laced 
 people around here caught a glimpse of it!
