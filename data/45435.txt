 
 Melissa,
 
 We've got a counterparty with a draft of a master where the counterparty has 
 the rounding conventing for kilowatts at 6 decimal points.  Is that our 
 standard convention?  Thanks for your help!
 
 P.S.  I have passed your request for a copy of that assignment to my 
 assistant Taffy Milligan.  She can get you copies of any documents in the 
 future.
