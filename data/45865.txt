 
 Attached is a clean and blacklined draft of the changes to the ISDA 
 Schedule.  We have also attached the proposed form of Enron Corp. Guaranty 
 and the legal opinions of Enron North America and Enron Corp.  The opinions 
 of Cadwalader with respect to the ISDA and the Guaranty will be sent shortly 
 under separate cover from Susan Lobel at Cadwalader.  It appears the only 
 remaining issue on the ISDA is the "Conditions Precedent" provision which 
 NYPA is still considering.
 
 Please let me know if these changes meet with your approval.
