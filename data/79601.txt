  Mike:
 
  I finally got George Damiris' resume (attached) as well as that of Randy 
 Balhorn (also attached). I think when you read Randy's CV, you will be very 
 impressed. I would go so far as to say that he was the smartest person I knew 
 at Koch, and when you see the list of accomplishments that he had there, as 
 well as what he was doing with Dreyfuss and Electricite de France, you will 
 agree with me that he would be a terrific addition to Enron Global Markets. 
 The even better news regarding Randy is that he recently left Dreyfuss due to 
 issues with the EDF JV, so he is available immediately and he is very 
 interested. He currently lives in London and I think that he knows Joe Gold. 
 Please let me know if you would like me to do anything to help facilitate 
 this further.  I think George is interested if there was a specific 
 opportunity for him here that he felt was an even better fit than what he is 
 doing with Koch. The fact that he is moving to Houston makes it pretty easy 
 for us to keep having discussions with him. I would say, however, if I had to 
 choose which among the two of them would have the most immediate impact if 
 hired by Enron, it would have to be Randy, given his experience.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Basil
