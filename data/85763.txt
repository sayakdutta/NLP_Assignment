 
 Rudwell,  Can you respond to Roeline with the amount required in the guaranty?  Thanks.
 
  
     
 I have sent the guaranty to our Attorney for review of the requested
 changes.  If acceptable, the guaranty will be issued shortly.  However,
 please advise the amount to be covered by the guaranty.
 
 Many thanks,
