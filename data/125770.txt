 I have no memory of receiving this info.  Can you send me another?
 
 
     
 
 Hi John 
  
 The Critical Illness packages were delivered Oct.12 and should be an entire policy in a clear plastic zip bag.  If you can not find the policy at home or around your desk I will gladly request a new policy from Unum.  Unfortunately this is not a generic form, but one that had been preprinted by the Insurance Company.   Let me know...
  
 Thanks,
 Michelle 
 
 
     
 
 There is nothing in my inbox.  I have no form to sign.  Could you deliver me one please?

 If you are reading this message, you owe me a form.
  
 Critical Illness policies have been distributed for a week and a half.  There is a Premium Notice & Authorization form in each Critical Illness package.  Please sign and return to me immediately to ensure your coverage is not delayed.  All forms need to be sent to me by October 29th, 2001. 
 
 Thanks,
 
  Michelle Wells
