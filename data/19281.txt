 I have not spoken to him directly in a while. I know Glen Hass in our Omaha office talked to him the other day and could give you that number. Thanks.
 
  
     
 Greetings.  Hope, given the circumstances, that you're well.  I'm trying to get a hold of Mark Baldwin, and the number I have gets a recording saying that it ain't the number anymore.  Do you have a number for him.  Greatly appreciated.  
 
 Best,
 Jeff
