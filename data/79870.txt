 Dear Mike,
 
 Rene Ortiz, the recent Minister of Energy for Ecuador (1998-1999) and former
 Secretary General of OPEC (1978-83) is Conference Chair for a major gas and
 power conference in Quito, September 18-19.  The Conference is expected to
 attract key energy leaders from latin America.  I understand that former
 Sauid Minister Yamani and Fadil Al Chalabi will also attend.
 
 Rene is an old, old friend.
 
 If this is of interest to you, ENRON please let me know.  From your
 description of ENRON ONLINE at the Price School of Business in April, I think
 this is a natural.
 
 My Institute for Energy Economics and Policy will also partner with Global
 Change Associates and a number of major services providers to hold a major
 conference on energy ecommerce in Beijing, May 24-5, 2001. Again if this is
 of interest we would welcome ENRON's participation on the program, as a
 sponsor and/or an exhibitor.
 
 Please let me know the next time you visit OU.
 
 Best regards,
 
 Dennis O'Brien
