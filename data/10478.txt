 Why do these reports have to be done before the 8:00 a.m. meeting. This has not been the procedure in the past.  If these numbers are asked for in the morning meeting, they can be quickly obtained or the previous days numbers are available.

 We need to complete the Oneok Recap and the Bushton (PVR) file, before the 8:00 A.M. Meeting, EACH DAY.
 
 I asked to create a Bushton Group to assist our team in completing the Bushton file.
 
 Please contact me if you have any questions.
 
 Thanks
 
 Robert
