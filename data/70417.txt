 
 I never would have guessed smoked oysters.  I think I'm cooking for the 4 of 
 us, plus Lena and any stray friends we find.  We will probably come to 
 Palacios on Saturday and spend the night, although I haven't discussed it 
 with Mom yet.
 
 It is dreary here today, but in a nice way.  I don't mind it too much, 
 although by Sunday we may be stir crazy.  
 
 We went to Michael's school on Wednesday, as his class was singing in 
 chapel.  Roger Clements was there, video cam in hand, doing the dad thing.  
 He is a really big guy, much bigger than I thought.  He looks like a football 
 player.  I see why Piazza didn't take a swing!
 
 I would say "break a leg" for Katie, but with your groups orthopedic 
 problems, I hesitate to use the phrase!
 
 Love,
 
 Kay
