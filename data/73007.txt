 I don't remember who actually gives the notice, but in anticipation of the 
 funding of the escrow tomorrow, here are the docs.
 
 
 
 I understand there is also a two day notice.  I don't believe I've seen a 
 form for that one yet.
 
 Who should send this out tomorrow after we get the fed ref?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
