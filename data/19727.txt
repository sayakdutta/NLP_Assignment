 I spoke with Jeff Dasovich and got an update of discussions with PG&E.  He received an email yesterday from Dan Richards (Steve Kean equivalent at PG&E) and he is getting a contact for us to interface with at PG&E on this issue.  Dan indicated that he would try and have a name and number to Jeff by early next week, so Jeff will keep us posted.  If you have any questions, comments, etc. give me a call and I'll track it down.
