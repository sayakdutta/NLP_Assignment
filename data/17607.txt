 
 We're getting a lot of inquiries about Enron's role in California's de-reg 
 history, with a lot of misinformation arising out of Peace's handywork.  
 
 I spent about 3 hours on Friday with a Sac Bee reporter (Dale Kasler).  He'll 
 be interviewing Skilling on the same topic in a week or so, and he'd like to 
 talk to Steve, too.  
 
 Sue spent time with a NYT reporter discussing the same. Some common themes 
 are arising in the questions.  Thought it would be a good idea to spend 30 
 minutes discussing those themes and developing our messages to ensure 
 consistency.  If folks think it would be useful, is there a time this week 
 that we could squeeze in 30 minutes?  Thanks.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
