 
 Please note the following on the 6/5/00 list:
 
 We are shutting down Aquila Risk Management Corporation for all financial 
 trading effective today.  All financial trading should be done out of 
 Utilicorp United Inc.  This counterparty was on the original approval list, 
 and I previously had them shut down for financial trading.  Credit will put 
 them on tonight's list, meanwhile, we need to open them up to trade all 
 financial immediately.
