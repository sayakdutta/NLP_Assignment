 Scott,
   Please let your gas traders know that Inside FERC will not accept bidweek
 prices via fax any later than 2 p.m. Eastern time. It takes a great deal of 
 time
 to input each deal by hand and then re-check the data for accuracy -- and 
 that's
 before we even begin to analyze each pricing point to determine the indexes.
   If anyone has any questions, they can contact me at the number below.
 Regards,
 Liane Kucher, Associate Editor
