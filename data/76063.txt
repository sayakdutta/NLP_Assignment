 In the  TurboPark world there will be certain impacts on how power projects 
 involving physical capacity are structured and implemented.  I know some (but 
 not all) of it.  I can say that it is fairly easy to bust the structure and 
 wind up with assets on the balance sheet, and that the commercial folks 
 aren't always (or even usually) sensitive to the issues.  Maybe after the 
 first of the year those group members who will be working on the power 
 origination and development side could get briefed by the finance and 
 accounting folks.
