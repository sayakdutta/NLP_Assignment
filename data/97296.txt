 The deal was done between Mark and Janice at SRP.  I heard him make the call.  Also, do you have any more avenues with PAC tranny like a supervisor or something.  I am not really in a position to negotiate with anyone.  They all claim that they can't change the Oasis system.  
 
  
     
 Holden,
 
 SRP is comming back saying that they do not see deal 805316 on 9/12.  Can you look into this 
 
 Thanks
