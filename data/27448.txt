 John, A resolution to this issue has not been made.  Obviously we will need to have a resolution prior to final settlement.

  Mark, 
 Hope all is well in Taylor.    I have a couple of questions about OOMC 
 capacity payments.    As discussed in our meeting,  I received a manual 
 OOMC on Thursday 9/13 (10:30 pm)  from Terry at the ISO. 
 He reserved 220 mw of capacity from the Frontera unti for hours ending 
 9-2400 for Friday,  Sept 14th. 
 We were,  indeed,   exercised on Friday.    I think that we understand 
 the payment for the energy portion of the exercise. 
 However,  we are not certain what we will be paid for the capacity 
 portion,  as the formula for OOMC payment is based upon the Replacement 
 reserve market. 
 The replacement reserve prices have been zero. 
 Could you provide some help on this? 
 Thanks, 
 J Forney
