 Folks,
 
 We are confirmed for our meeting next Wednesday the 17th in room 3125b at 3 
 pm.  To reiterate, the purpose of the meeting will be to clarify the 
 procedures for implementing ISDA agreements with counterparties interested in 
 financial derivative transactions.  The goal is for everyone to understand 
 the process as it relates to different types of counterparties and to 
 streamline the internal process wherever possible.
 
 See you next week.
 
 -Mike
