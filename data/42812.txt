 
 Ms. Alexander:
 
 	At the request of Tanya Rohauer with Enron, I am forwarding you a form Master Netting, Setoff, and Security Agreement together with a Collateral Annex.  I will start preparing specific documents for Williams, but thought this might be a good starting place.
 
 	I would appreciate it if you could forward these on to all appropriate parties.  In particular, if I could get the name of your lawyer so that I could forward things directly to him or her, that would be greatly appreciated.
 
 Thanks so much.
