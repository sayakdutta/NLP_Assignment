 
 Frank:  FYI.  Let's tell her that we can execute the :
 
 (1)  letter
 (2)  the separate ISDA amendment
 (3) our understanding (together with Vastar's) of the "old" guaranty.
 
 I have a doctor's appointment at noon but I'll be back afterwards.

 Sara,
 
 I have a couple quick comments on the letter you sent this morning.  In
 general, we need to make clear that we are replacing the credit support
 provider under the ISDA.  Otherwise, I am concerned that we could face a
 possible default under the ISDA once the VRI parental guaranty is
 terminated. Otherwise, the letter looks very agreeable to me.  I am
 anticipating we can get this executed today so please keep in touch with me
 in regards to any further changes you would like to make.
 
 Many thanks for all your help.
 
 Best regards,
 
 Nicole Russell
