 
 Sorry about the serial emails.  
 
 I need electronic versions of the final acknowledgement letters for both ABB 
 and GE, so that these can be emailed to them.  
 
 Please prepare a closing list.  Between this and the financing side, I'm 
 chasing quite a few documents.
 
 I hope to have the escrow agreement signed today, but I would really like to 
 know we have the amendment finished.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
