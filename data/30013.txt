      Attached is a spreadsheet containing indicative pricing for both a
      capital markets and an on-books loan with a swap.  You will note that
      as before we have converted the capital markets rate to a monthly pay
      actual/360 basis for comparison purposes.
 
      Capital markets spreads have narrowed since our last discussion and
      are now 125-130 over the ten-year.
 
      Thanks again for the project update and pls call me with any questions
      about the numbers.
 
 
      Regards
      Bill
