 Dear Mr. Izzo:
 
 I'd like to offer EECC a free "Storefront" on my VerticalNet Web-site Power
 On-Line.
 
 http://www.poweronline.com
 
 A Storefront is a Company Showcase where EECC can reach the 100K+ visitors
 that come to Power On-Line to read content, search for products and company
 information and conduct eCommerce over the Internet.
 
 Power On-Line is a VerticalNet Community that is dedicated to Power
 Generation Professionals in the Power Industry worldwide.
 
 Microsoft has teamed with VerticalNet and will be paying for this service
 for one year.  It is free, with no commitments or strings attached.
 
 Please forward to me a contact and telephone number of the person I should
 further discuss this with at EECC.  Also, if you could forward the same
 information on a contact at ENRON Corporate, I would like to offer the same
 opportunity.
 
 Thank you, for your time.
