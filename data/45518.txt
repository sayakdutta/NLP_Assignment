 
 Andrea Hauser w/EnronOnline called and said that Marathon has a problem with 
 the terms of the online GTC's (default language) for LPG, petrochems, and 
 refined products and would like to talk to one of our lawyers.   Marathon's 
 lawyer is Rhonda Stinemyer and her # is 713/296-2408.  Can you let Andrea 
 know who will be handling this.
 
 Thanks.
