 Thanks for your message. I am familiar with the Computational Finance  program
 and value its high quality.
 
 Please, call me next week. The best time is between 7:00 and 8:30  a.m.
 CST.

 Vince,
 
 Greetings!  I am the director of the MS in Computational Finance program at
 Carnegie Mellon.  I am following up on a conversation I had with Kevin
 Kindall, a graduate of our program, who gave me your e-mail address and
 suggested I contact you as the individual making the recruiting decisions
 for the Research Group at Enron.
 
 In speaking with the director of the Career Opportunity Center at the
 business school, I am told that although an Alison Bailey from Enron

 which to conduct interviews on campus on December 11th, there is as yet no
 indication of whether the Comp Finance students will have opportunity to
 compete for these spaces.
 
 We are regarded by many in the industry as the top quantitative finance
 program in the country.  Focused on derivative pricing, econometrics, VAR
 and portfolio management, our graduates should be an excellent fit for your
 business.  I would be happy to talk with you further about our
 rogram( http://student.gsia.cmu.edu/mscf/) as well as our students' interest
 in Enron (the name comes up a lot!).  Also, if you are interested, we run a
 "Speaker Series"  on most Friday's during the fall and spring that would
 give you (or another in your group) the opportunity to address our students
 in an area of interest.  Such a meeting would, I think, help you better
 understand the careers our students are preparing to pursue as well as give
 our students first hand knowledge of Enron and its future.
 
 When might be a good time to contact you by telephone?
 
 Thank you for your time.
 
 Rick
