 
 Joe,  
 
 I have been reading about ePower and potentially building sites.  I know you 
 are clarifying it's activities but until then, I have instructed my guys to 
 respond to ePower when they call and to discuss events (e.g.:  possible LNG 
 re-gas plans for ePower) but to make sure and discuss all activities with you 
 as well.
 
 Let me know if you want something different or want me to email other 
 instructions.
 
 Thanks,
 Mike
