 S - Do we still have an active Advisory Council?  As you know, I participated in these meetings several years ago, before the Policy Comm. was established, and they were helpful.  As you review who participates in these meetings in the future, please keep me in mind - many of the members express views and opinions along the same lines as many of our portfolio managers.  Thanks. MEK
