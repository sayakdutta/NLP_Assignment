 Just wanted to let you know that all the great work in Blue Range is paying 
 off in the US - citing Blue Range, a Houston bankruptcy court correctly 
 decided that a gas contract was a forward contract relative to the US safe 
 harbor provisions.  If you want a copy of the opinion let me know.
 
 Hope all is well.
