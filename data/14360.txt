 
 Dave,
  
 I am fine. I thought Karen told you about me working from home today. I am reading the tissue book that I just received from Esko Uutella Consulting in Germany.
  
 I am also working on Abitibi's mills and send it to you by email. I asked Greg Bruch about the mills but he did not know the information as much in detail as we had it.
  
 Thanks,
 Monika

 I will be working from home for the rest of the day today. If you have any questions you can send them by email as I will be checking it from home.
 
 Thank you, 
 Monika Causholli
