 
 Greetings:
 
 Well, there's a finance midterm coming up and some of us have discussed 
 getting together the weekend before for a study session.  
 
 I just grabbed an old list from last year so apologies if I've included folks 
 who ain't even in finance, or if I've left some folks off.  Sorry to those 
 who received in error, and please forward to anyone else who might be 
 interested.  Anyway, anyone interested?  
 
 Hope all is well with all.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
