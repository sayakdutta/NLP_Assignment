 All - 
  
 The HR Team coordinating interviews for the new Origination Track is looking to nail down dates for interviews.  
  
 Please respond with available dates for those you assist ASAP.  We are looking to interview candidates toward the end of November, ideally November 26-30.  
  
 Attached is the list of the management team as well as assistants.  Please inform me of any incorrect data I have.  
  
 I will call you later today to discuss in more detail and confirm dates. 
  
 Kind regards,
