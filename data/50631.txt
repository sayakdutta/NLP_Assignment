 Frank,
 our VAR team has been looking at different ways to implement clustering and 
 jumps for power prices simulation
 in VAR.
 I attached the suggestion we came up with and the results of clustering and 
 jump parameters estimation.
 Would you like to discuss this methodology? We need your input.
 
 Please, let me know,
 
 Thank you,
 
 Tanya.
