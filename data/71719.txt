 Enron Field shuttle.  I don't need to stay late - I'm sure 2 hours would do 
 it.
 
 
 
 


   
  
 I would like to go to the Enron booth but it's truly your call. I bet we can
 get Choc to help but I need to call her asap...
 That's neat about the head of the PTL group.
 I think you should do some mom and son stuff with Michael. Your right about
 me and a large group of people on a boat...
 love, NM

 Hi.
 
 How's it going?
 
 Any more thoughts on tomorrow night?  We could ask your mother to sit for a
 little while.  I think it is pretty neat to get invited to the Enron one.
 
 The head of the power trading legal group stopped by and said to let her
 know if I ever want to change groups.  I thought that was nice.
 
 I'm contemplating doing something special with Michael over spring break.
 I figure you guys have lots of "guy only" stuff coming up, but there aren't
 a lot of "mom/son" opportunities.  (be realistic)  Maybe we should take a
 Disney cruise, since that's something you wouldn't like to do.
 
 Love,
