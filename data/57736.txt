 Two documents:
 First is the external document we faxed to certain reporters.
 This is what Steve is referring to.
 
 
 Second is the talking points which reflect all changes to date.
 I am waiting legal approval - which I'm expecting any minute
 (I emailed Mike Smith your changes last night).   
 
 
 
 We should put both on website as soon as I track down Mike or Vicki. 
 
 Thanks,
 Peggy  
 
 
 
  
 
 
     
 Peggy --
 
 My understanding is that you and Steve Kean finished these talking points.  
 Can I please get the final copy?
