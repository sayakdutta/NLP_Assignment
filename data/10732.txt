 
 	Let me try this answer:  
 
 	A transportation delivery directly to Demarc Def. is a part of the Demarc allocation.  When we
 	look at a storage allocation, we review all the injections (or withdrawals) at the storage point.
 
 	Don't hesitate to edit my comment.  Thanks. Lynn
 
  
     
 I guess what Lynn is trying to convey is that, for the Demarc allocation which is a "group allocation", the system looks at transportation paths from the field to demarc and Demarc deferred, but the allocation only looks the delivery side of the allocation to implement the allocation, it does not take into consideration the receipt side of the path into account for the allocation.
 
  
     
 Do we want to say "path" since we do not allocate by path - by point, by group?

 	OK, after talking with Gerry, here is my second try at answering Greg's question trying
 	not to get to detailed.  What do you think?

 Thanks for the clarification.
 
 On number 4 is still a little fuzzy.  Does Demarc Deff. get allocated during the
 same cycle as Demarc?  Seems unlikely since Demarc Deff. is a storage pt and
 storage is allocated at a different time? [Blair, Lynn]   Greg, if there is a transportation path from field to
 demarc def, then the path is a part of the demarc allocation.  If there is a transportation path from field to demarc, then
 	demarc to demarc def., the transportation path is considered in the demarc allocation, but the storage path
 	will not be considered until the storage allocation.  
 If we were nominating our Firm from Beatrice to Demarc Deff. where would our
 customers pull from? [Blair, Lynn]   Customers can pick up gas at Demarc Def.
  The storage that is offered by NNG's park and ride is at what location?  Demarc
 or Demarc Deff.? [Blair, Lynn]  	Demarc def.

 >                (2) RANK changed to a different number

 > keep their gas flowing?
 >
 >         Answer - The field Receipt to demarc deffered delivery
