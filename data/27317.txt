 Do you want to answer George's questions, or do you want me to handle this?

 John, 
 
 Good morning. I picked up the packet with the offer letter and confidentiality agreement.  There are a few items I wanted to discuss with you before going forward.  Let me know when you have an opportunity.  Thank you.  GTP 
 
 
     
 George,
 I have requested your status from HR.    Lloyd is out of town until Monday,   so please just hang loose until further.
 When I have a reply from HR,  I will contact you.
 
 Thanks,
 JMF
 
  
     
 Any progress on the transition?  Do you think I should hint to the fact that we all met?  Let me know your thoughts.  George
