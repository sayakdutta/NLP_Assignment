 
 Based on what Fletch and Doug are doing, I would increase your #'s significantly.   Your liquidity data is very conservative compared to Fletch and Doug.   Your forward volumes are approx. 20% of Doug and Fletch and your ST data is about 50%.
 
 I would complete the form based on the liquidity we saw in Aug and Sept.
