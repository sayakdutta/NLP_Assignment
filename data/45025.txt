 
 Just as we got the assignment of the natgas trades in, I got a call from 
 Anita Herrera, the attorney for Statoil, saying she is sending me an 
 assignment of the crude trades tomorrow.  It won't be as painful a process, 
 since she told me we they only have one or two crude trades left on the 
 books.  Anyway, I wanted to give you a head's up (and maybe to keep any 
 collateral you might have to cover the crude trades!)...
