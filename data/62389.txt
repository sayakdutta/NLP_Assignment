 
 I met with Shea in Houston.  Didn't broach the issue on working in Canada for us.  He always puts on a good face about TC but I'm not sure he loves it.  Until recently I was happy with Lambie.  Call me.  We should think about it.  
 
 
 
  
     
 John, TCGS turned in another dismal performance last year losing C$150MM. Word on the street is that bonuses (payable later this mo.) are going to be zero or close to zero. Supposedly, Shea's group was the only P&L that made money. Timing maybe good to approach Shea once again.
 
 What are your thoughts on moving McKay to Houston, and me going after Shea et al to run ECC's gas trading - Jury is still out on Lambie, and Disturnal is a non-starter. 
 
 Let me know what you think and  I will proceed accordingly.
