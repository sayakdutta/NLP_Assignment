 
 The only thing I use Kim for is to take up a hem.  She really isn't a great 
 seamstress.  I also use that place on the corner of Greenbriar & Bissonnet, 
 Alter Alley, if I need a jacket or a drass taken in, or sleeves shortened.  
 Some people have told me they use that seamstress by the Hot Bagel shop and 
 said they have done a really good job, but I have personally never used 
 them.   I have an absolutely fabulous seamstress, she made my Barbie dress 
 for Holly's prom, and has made bed coverings and table skirts for Lucinda and 
 does a great job.  Her name is Ruth Erwin , she lives there right off 
 Bellaire Blvd, close to the fwy and her # is 667-9731.   She is an absolute 
 sweetheart.  I don't give her name out to a whole lot of people because I 
 don't want to get her too busy or too expensive (I'm so selfish!).  Only to 
 my select, special friends!
