 I'm sorry. TECO and Ft. Pierce Utility Authority.
 
  
     
 I need the name of the other party involved in Ft Pierce so that John can 
 clear conflicts.
 
 
    
  
 Can we assume this will also cover Ft. Pierce?
 
  
     
 Mark Haedicke approved the hiring of King & Spalding for this matter.  I will 
 drop Mr. Derrick a voice mail, but I would faint if he objected.
 
 John, we need to talk about the sale of the LLC, and the generation of a 
 draft doc re same.  Please let me know if you are available today to discuss 
 this transaction with Sr. Jacoby and me.  Additionally, it would be helpful 
 to discuss the tolling arrangement with Ken.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
