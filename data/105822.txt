 Sara,
 
 A question for you:
 
 Would it be possible to very quickly amend the existing ISDA to add the name
 Glencore AG? Brant is unable to approve certain trades until this is done and 
 I
 would rather not wait for the guarantee and credit issues to be resolved as 
 this
 may take some time.
 
 David
