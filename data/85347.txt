 
 I might have fallen asleep before in church, but fortunately have never 
 turned myself into a human candle.  I did spend several years as an altar 
 boy.  We got to wear those cool outfits also.  
 
 How are you doing?  Thanks for not rubbing in the loss from Saturday.  This 
 is a time of healing right now for me, so be gentle.

 Since your Catholic, I thought you might find this funny. Who knows this
 might have even happened to you! Just kididng--Emmye
