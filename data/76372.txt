 Sorry it took so long to get back to you.  Today has been beyond frenetic.
 
 I agree with your comment #1.  I expect they will ask us for a rep like the 
 one in #2, but they still want to hear it from GE.

 Kay:
 
 My comments as follows:
 
 1. In item 1, we should reference Coral's purchase of 80% of the member 
 interests, and potential purchase of the remaining 20% after the COD.
 
 2. Shouldn't we be able to handle item 2 with an ENA rep?
 
 I think the acknowledgement letter needs to be very narrow with respect to 
 the sale of the 80% member interest to Coral, and potential purchase of the 
 remaining 20%.. An acknowledgement from GE that the sale of the 80% and 
 subsequent sale of the remining 20% comply with the assignment provisions 
 should be sufficient.
 
 Regards,
 
 Ben

 Subject to review of the final form of Facility Agreement, attached is a
 proposed form of acknowledgement letter which would be required to be
 obtained from GE with respect to each LLC, with the name of each LLC
 changed accordingly.
