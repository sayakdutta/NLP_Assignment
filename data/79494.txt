 Attached is the most recent draft of the reorg announcement.  Cathy will have 
 this ready to go out tomorrow, close of business.  Please review again and 
 mark up any changes that you believe are required.  Please read the Per and 
 Randy section carefully for errors and wording.  JN, Please change wording 
 for Randy's most recent assignment, i put something down as a marker.  Also 
 come up with a 1 sentence lead for Randy on the expected growth and 
 opportunities around his efforts.
 
 Please read carefully for better wording and errors.  Return to Cathy by 2 pm 
 and we will make final changes and send it out at 6pm.
 
 Thanks,
 Mike
