 I told him he could not count on the same generous treatment
 he got the first time.

 Dear Vince:
 ?
 After a very great deal of thought, I have decided  to stick it out with El 
 Paso. 
 ?
 Please be assured that this exercise was not a  "fishing expedition" to 
 extract concessions from El Paso.? Rather, it is  simply that, although I 
 continue to harbor doubts about some of El Paso's  methods and about the 
 people running the business, I have concluded that two  months is not enough 
 time to fully judge the company.? I feel that I have  not yet given El Paso 
 (or myself for that matter) a fair chance.? After  all, if I disagree with 
 the way the business is run, I should regard that as an  opportunity to 
 effect changes and not an excuse to run away.
 ?
 Please extend my sincerest thanks and apologies to  all those who worked so 
 hard over the holidays to produce the offer: David  Oxley, Sheila Walton, and 
 especially Norma Villarreal.
 ?
 And thanks also to you Vince for your patience,  humor, and good advice.? As 
 I've said before, I consider it an honor to be  able to call you a colleague 
 and friend.
 ?
 With Best  Regards,
 Grant.
