 "Volatility of Electricity  Prices - Measurement and Analysis of Underlying  
 Causes"
 Dr.  Vincent Kaminski
 Managing Director and Head of Research for Enron  Corp.

 Abstract:
 
 The last three years were characterized  by exceptionally high volatility of 
 the power prices in the US markets. The  market developments have created a 
 number of unique challenges for energy  industry economists. One immediate 
 question we have to answer is how to  measure volatility of energy prices. 
 Although we can all agree that the  prices in the power markets are 
 characterized by high variability, the  traditional measures used in 
 financial economics (annualized standard  deviation of log price returns) may 
 not fit well electricity prices.  
 
 
 The second challenge is to explain the  sources of high price volatility and 
 to answer the question to what extent  it can be attributed to problems that 
 can be addressed in the long run. Such  problems include flaws in market 
 design that allow some market participants  to abuse market power, limited 
 availability and/or unequal access to  transmission, temporary shortages of 
 generation capacity. Some factors  underlying high volatility of electricity 
 prices may be of permanent nature  and may be a necessary price to pay for 
 increased market efficiency and  expanded customer choice.
