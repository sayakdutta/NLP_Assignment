 Contact numbers are listed below for Greg Piper and me if needed over the weekend.  Mark Pickering is out of the country, and we are coordinating with him as we complete scenarios on reduced costs.  Our team is continuing to work on this tonight and we will reconvene in the office starting at 8:00 am on Saturday.  We are working in Conference Room 4100 on the 4th floor of ECS (next to my office).  Please let us know when you would like to review the information.   --Sally
