 For ESA to exercise its LM 6000 purchase option, it must pay the Option 
 Exercise Price of $101,249,431 (per section 3A of the Option Agreement) plus 
 an additional charge of $21,500 per day for each day after November 22d (per 
 section 3B of the Option Agreement).  If the option is exercised on December 
 13th, the total amount to be paid would be:
 
 Option Exercise Price      $101,249,431
 Plus: Additional Costs: $21,500 per day x 21 days =     $        451,500
 Option Exercise Price plus Additional Costs  $101,700,931
 
 Please let me know if the execution date changes because this will also 
 change the total dollar amount.
 
 Thanks,
 Rebecca
