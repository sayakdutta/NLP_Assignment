 Jeff:
 
 It was a pleasure to meet you last week at the Inn at Penn.  It sounds as
 though Enron is doing some very exciting things with more to come in the
 future.
 
 I called Vince Kaminski a few times last week.  His secretary mentioned that
 he was off again this week on a business trip returning on Oct 9th, I
 believe.  I am confident that he will get a project proposal to us by the 13
 Oct deadline.
 
 Thank you for your support of the Wharton School.  We look forward to having
 Enron host a Tiger Team Project.
 
 Sincerely,
 Donna Piazze
