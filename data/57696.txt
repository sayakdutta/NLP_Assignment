 Ginger - please forward this to all of GA.  Thanks.
 
 This is a request for help from my colleagues in GA.  I am preparing Enron's 
 comments to the Federal Trade Commission concerning the results of different 
 "regulatory approaches" by states implementing retail electric competition 
 programs or legislation.  The FTC has invited comments on a number of 
 specific issues, but their goal is to "examine various state retail 
 competition programs and describe those features that have resulted in 
 consumer benefits and those that have not yielded consumer benefits."  
 
 There are some obvious areas where we'll comment - California - but I'd 
 appreciate people sending me specific examples of good or bad regulatory 
 policies in other states.   Also, does anyone know of any good reports or 
 analyses already prepared on these issues?   Thanks.  -Bob
