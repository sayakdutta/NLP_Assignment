 1st Annual 2-on-2 Basketball Tournament
 

 
 Where:         4527 Holly St.
           Bellaire, TX 77401
 
 Details:       It will be a 2-on-2 tournament at my house starting around
 11AM.  I should have college football games on all day in the house.  LSU,
 UT, and A&M are all off that weekend.
 
 I'm supplying all the gatorade, ice, and anything else we may need.  Bring
 $5 to pay for the gatorade and whatever is left over can buy beer/go to the
 winners.
 
 We will not setup teams.  You either come with your partner or come hoping
 that someone else needs a partner, too.
 
 It will be a double-elimination tournament on a 8 1/2 or 9 ft. goal and
 scoring will go as follows: to seven by ones, winning by two or first to
 ten points to keep games moving.  We may need to put a time limit on games
 if we have too many teams.
 
 If someone has an old TV that they can bring over, we can put it on in the
 garage in the backyard.
 
 If you want to reply to me, please don't reply to all.  This invitation is
 not limited to people in the  people.  We should have enough teams.
 
 Call me, or send me an email, if you have any questions.
 
 Thanks -
 Val
