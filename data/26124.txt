 
 We are in the same building.  The move got postponed until next week.  Using the same badges.  I have the same phone #.  Parking is the same.  I believe that the drive down here is open, may be some slowdown on the way out, not sure.  Whew...I think I covered everything.  See you in a little while.

     Same badges ?? or different?
     Your number the same?? (I'll call if lost or a problem)
     Parking?? Anything different I should know.
 See you between 11 and 11:15.........
 
 Oh, one other question. I-45 --- any construction delays between here and
 there. Have not been downtown since last we had lunch.
 
 Bet you didn't think this would be so difficult.
 
 See you

 Let's og today if you can, or tomorrow.  I'm available anytime after 11:00.
 Are you going to try your badge again?  They are reviewing the photos now,
 along with new scanners.

    Hi,
 
    How are you doing? Still feel like lunch?
 
    I'm sad about Enron's demise. A lot  of people got hurt on this one.
 
    What the hell ....... I feel like lunch  and you probably need to get
    out of there so let me know what's good for  you.
