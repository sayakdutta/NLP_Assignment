 We've moved up the food chain at Destin, but have not received a response 
 yet.  I'll be out next week.  Check with Joe Casas to see if he hears anything

 Susan,
 
 I know you are quite busy with other items, but have you had time to
 discuss the BTU protest with the Enron attorneys?  As I told you before,
 Rebel would be more than happy to write "the letter", but I believe it will
 have to be submitted by Enron as the shipper.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Stevens
