 
 Brian,  Attached is a draft of the termination letter.  The letter assumes 
 the letter agreement was executed.  There also appears to be an agency 
 agreement which appointed Merrick as agent for ROW acquisition.  This is also 
 terminated by the letter.  I haven't heard from Shonnie yet.  Please review 
 and add any comments you have.  Thanks
