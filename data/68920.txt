 Hi guys,
 
 Because of the EOL group putting in language to automatically flip deals to 
 the P& book as soon as they are booked, the number of deals to be flipped at 
 the end of the month has decreased quite a lot, but there are always some 
 stragglers that are left behind.  Here is what I've come across.  Could you 
 please flip these deals before the end of the week.
 
 FT-EAST
 
 
 
 FT-ONTARIO
 
 
 
 G-DAILY-EST
 
 
 
 GD-CENTRAL
 
 
 
 As far as I know, these are the only deals that still need to be flipped.  
 I've gone through all the other books that I could
 think of, but I might have missed some.  Could you please make sure that I'm 
 not missing any deals.  
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions on this, and please let me know 
 when these have been flipped.
 
 Thanks for all your help again.
 
 Stacey
