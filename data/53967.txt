 Dear Vince,
 
 This is to inform you that your subscription to Power Finance and Risk will 
 be up for renewal in February.  In the past, such renewals were routed to 
 Info Central to be paid.  Our department has changed its focus to research.
 As a courtesy, we will be happy to process your subscription for the next 
 year.  Please let me know if you would like to renew and include your Cost 
 Center and Company Codes with the renewal.
 If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me.
 Sincerely,
 Stephanie E. Taylor
