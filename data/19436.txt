Richmond (Republican leading Assembly efforts) has agreed to stay in touch with  Bev over the weekend in the very unlikely event that something rekindles between Rs and Ds.  In the meantime, with Davis and the Assembly Ds drifting back to the left, we'll need to redouble our own efforts to make sure we don't lose the ground we've gained.  Scott, are they meeting again on  Monday, or Tuesday?
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 The Assembly Appropriations Committee canceled the SBX2 78 hearing mid-way
 through the presentation by Senator Polanco.  As Hedy indicated before, with
 the Republicans not willing to vote for the bill, liberal Democrats crafted
 11 new amendments which they felt were necessary in order to garner their
 votes.  Clearly there was no consensus among committee members or leadership
 on the amendments in question and the business community was up in arms.
 Amid the confusion, Hertzberg effectively ordered the hearing canceled.
 They intend to hear the bill again on Monday.
