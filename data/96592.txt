 Ladies and Gentlemen,
 
 
 
 



  Mime-Version: 1.0
  
 
 Per Chris Gaffney's request, attached for your review are blacklines of all 
 of the transaction documents.  With respect to these "near final" drafts, 
 please note the following:  (i) the Enron Corp.  Guaranty and the form of UIL 
 Guaranty are being sent separately as well as part of the WPSA to highlight 
 changes made to those documents from the prior drafts (they will appear 
 completely underlined as Schedules to the WPSA); (ii) we have incorporated 
 much of the comments from Wiggin & Dana with respect to Section 2.2 of the 
 PPA Entitlements Transfer Agreement and Schedule 4 to the WPSA, but the new 
 text may still need some tinkering with, particularly since the retention of 
 the power entitlements by UI (coupled with the payment of the sale proceeds 
 to EPMI) required a flow through of some conforming changes throughout the 
 PETA; and (iii) the attached side letter relating to the RESCO Power pricing 
 has not been reviewed by Enron as of this e-mail.  If you have any questions, 
 please do not hesitate to contact Stephen Polakoff at 212-424-8350.
