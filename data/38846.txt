 
 Hey, sorry I didn't write you back sooner however I had a six day break.  
 Anyway,  ST Pattys day was a blast, Dahl and Pat and I started drinking 
 around 10am and by the time the night was over we had been to 10 different 
 bars, (got kicked out of two)  met up with a ton of people and had an overall 
 blast.  I was so hating it the next day.   My sister was up from LA this 
 weekend.  We had a really good time.  Went to Touche and the Gypsy on 
 Thursday, went to the Blazer game and then Scooters.  On Saturday night we 
 went to the Kennedy School, and on Sunday we went to Multnomah Falls and took 
 her to Beaches for lunch.  She had a really good time and it was nice to have 
 her up for the weekend.  Anyway, how is everything with you?
