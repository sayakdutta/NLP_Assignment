 I am going to order denim shirts for the Research Group again.  If you do not 
 have one or need a new one, please let me know by Friday, June 23, 2000.
 
 FYI - new group members
 The Research Group will provide you with a long sleeve denim shirt that says 
 "Research Group" above the pocket.  The first shirt is free, any after that 
 you will have to pay for (approximately $45.00).
 
 Please furnish me with your shirt size:  Men Or Women - Small, Medium, Large, 
 or Extra Large.
 
 Thanks!
