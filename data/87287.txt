 
 Paul,
 
 A fully executed agreement will be placed in the mail today  for your 
 records.  However,  Enron Corp.'s guaranty  has not been included as I await 
 signature from the corporate office.  Upon receipt of same,  I will send an 
 original for your records.
 
 Please do not hesitate to give me a call if you have any questions or I can 
 be of further assistance.
 
 Regards,
 Debra Perlingiere
