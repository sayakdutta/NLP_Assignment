 Sara,
 I spoke with Brent and we are going to try and have the first session next 
 Tues. if possible.  I will let you and Brent know for sure.  My assistant is 
 trying to locate a large conference room.

 Kim:
 
 I hope Portland was successful.
 
 I'd like to go ahead and schedule two lunch sessions with the 
 confirm/settlements group:  the first regarding basic financial 
 agreements/confirmations and format, lingo, etc (very general) and the second 
 more specific session addressing types of financial transactions and their 
 basic structures.  One day next week would be great and perhaps one or two 
 weeks after the first session for the followup.  Please send your dates and 
 list of attendees.
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.
 
 Thanks.  Sara

 Sara,
 I am actually in Portland but I got your voicemail regarding setting up a 
 training class.  I will be back in the office on Wed. afternoon and will 
 compile a list of people that need to attend.  I will have my assistant try 
 and locate a large conference room.  I would like to do this next week if 
 possible.  I was thinking maybe Tues. or Wed.  I will talk to you when I 
 return on Wed.  Thanks!
