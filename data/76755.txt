 
 We want to have an internal conference call at 330 (instato discuss the 
 enovate intercompany loans, and address any issues raised by the Enron 
 commercial/financial team.  I don't know the substance of the comments.

 Early morning is full, but I'm free at 10:00 and several hours thereafter.  
 Would this be in addition to or in lieu of the 3:30 call?  Also, do you have 
 any heads-up re:  what the comments will be?
 
 Thanks.  Heather
 

 What does your schedule look like Wednesday am?

 What about Wednesday morning to discuss Bracewell's draft of the
 intercompany loan agreement?  Kay could you check Heather's availability?
 Anyone else that should be included?
 
 Thanks,
