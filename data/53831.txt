 Please, give me an advice. The students from Rice wrote a report
 about EOL from which we extracted this article.
 We can publish it in out internal research weekly newsletter
 but I would like to make sure that we don't cross the line.
 The newsletter is internal but somebody can always capture the screen
 and distribute it electronically outside Enron (or get a hard copy).
 
 Who else could help to review it?

 Vince,
 I thought this subject might make for an interesting technical corner article.  If you think it appropriate, please feel free to edit and return to me.
 
 thanks
