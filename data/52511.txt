 Thanks. I am forwarding the message to my son.

 I spoke with my friend at IBM's San Jose office.  He is an IBM Fellow in the
 Advanced File Architecture department of the Almaden Research Center.  His

 408-927-2614.  I mentioned your son's areas of expertise, and he was
 interested in receiving a copy of his resume if your son might be
 interested. As I mentioned, Steve's area of interest is storage technology.
 Feel free to contact him and mention my name.  He said that IBM put on a
 hiring freeze three weeks ago, so it may be a couple of months until he can
 hire.  But, he has openings for the right people when he gets authority.
