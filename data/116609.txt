 
 Just something to keep in mind - 
 The confirms group in Houston is waiting on signed confirm letters from Grant 
 County for the following three deals -
 
 432854
 420554
 420563
 
 I've let Stephanie Piwetz and Sharen Cason know that you'll forward the 
 letters on to them once you receive them. Or you can give them to me and I'll 
 fax them over. Keep me posted on the progress.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate
