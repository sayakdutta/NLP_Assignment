 hi sara -- hope you had a good time in louisiana over the weekend!
 
 i managed to lose my voice so i can only communicate by email for the time 
 being.  could you confirm that you have no changes to the enron agreement or 
 send me a mark-up?  if you want to give the changes to me verbally, i could 
 probably have a legal assistant help me ask you questions if i need to.  
 please let me know.  
 
 many thanks.
