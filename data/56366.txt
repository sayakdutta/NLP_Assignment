 
 Charlene,
 I am sending you as promised the information I have about 3 of our summer 
 interns.
 I shall fax you this morning two additional resumes I have in hard copy.
 
 In the case of Paulo Rocha we don't have a formal
 resume, just a letter from him with the summary of his skills.
 
 Thanks for your help. Enron desperately needs this talent.
 
 Vince
