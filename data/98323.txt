 Richard,  we have heard nothing definitive.  The clerk at Brick Court 
 Chambers did mention recently that due to backlog at the court we may not get 
 there until May of 2001, but we certainly cannot rely on that.  The new term 
 opens October 1, so in principle we could go any time after that date.  I am 
 predicting toward the end of 1Q 2001.
 
 
    
  
 Have you heard anything about the schedule for the hearing in the CATS 
 appeal? I need to travel to London soon and I would like to attend.
