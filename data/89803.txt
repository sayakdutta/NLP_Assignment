 Kevin,
 
 Which do you prefer...an AM or PM phone interview?
 
 Please let me know,

 Tamara,
 
 A collegue in the Houston office forwarded on a message from Kevin that I should contact you to set up some telephone interviews with the following people;
 
 Kevin Presto (VP - head of East Power Trading)
 Fletcher Sturm (VP - head of midwest trading - East Power)
 Dana Davis (VP - head of northeast trading - East Power).
 
 Could you let me know a possible schedule? I'm available anytime this week, including any evening (London time) calls.
 
 Many thanks, 
 
 Tim
