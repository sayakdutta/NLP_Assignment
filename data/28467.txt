 a good job of finessing the issue.  Technically, you are right and PNM's 
 service is neither "firm" or "interruptible."  It is my understanding that 
 PNM  assigns priority based on a number of factors including whether the 
 customer is a core customer or not, et cet.  I think that PNM is capable of 
 determining on a contract by contract basis whether the capacity will be 
 firm, even though the rate schedule may not say "firm."   Explaining all that 
 complexity would make it unlikely that FERC would approve the rehearing.  
 Nevertheless, I believe its accurate to say that we will only repackage as 
 firm service the capacity that we buy from PNM and that they tell us is 
 "firm."  I think the draft does that, without going throught the unhelpful 
 detail on how PNM handles its own priority system.  If I misunderstand the 
 facts or if anyone disagrees with this approach, lets talk about it.  DF  
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 

 
  
 I have a concern with this overall argument about firm and interrupitble as 
 we stated we would only buy firm service from PNM, but moreso, when we looked 
 at the detail of the PNM service when preparing for the technical conference, 
 it is only best efforts-  does this argument fit?  and can we really buy firm 
 service from them??  MK
