 Look forward to meeting you in Houston. What about Wednesday,

 Vince,
 
 I'm  planning to be over for the management conference next week, arriving in 
 Houston on Tuesday afternoon.  I would appreciate having an hour with you 
 either then or on Wednesday.  Could you let me know if you are available 
 please?
 
 Thanks,
 Tani
