 In preparation for the final VP and MD PRC meeting, Rick has identified you 
 as a key business person to provide feedback on employees in his functional 
 organization.  We have made arrangements for you to access the Performance 
 Management System commonly known as PEP.  The URL is pep.corp.enron.com.  
 Please take a few minutes to access the system and provide your feedback on 
 the employees indicated under your id.  Rick would greatly appreciate it if 
 you could do this by Friday December 29th, but knowing the holidays are upon 
 us, no later than Tuesday January 2nd.   Your feedback is critical to this 
 process. 
 
 Should you need assistance accessing the system please feel free to contact 
 the help desk at ext. 34777,option 4.  Thanks and have a safe holiday.
