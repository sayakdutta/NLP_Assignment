 We don't show any trading contracts in existence with Vastar Gas Marketing,
 Inc.  All of Vastar Gas Marketing,Inc.'s contracts were assigned to Southern
 Company Energy Marketing after BP acquired Vastar.
 
 Do you have any information otherwise?
 
 Very truly yours,

 Mr. Dixon:
 
 Pursuant to Carol St. Clair's request, I am attaching our preliminary
 list of the agreements to be under the BP Master Netting Agreement.
 Since we don't own 100% of EOTT, any master netting agreement involving
 EOTT will not be under this master netting agreement.
 
 Please let us know if you have any questions or need anything else.
