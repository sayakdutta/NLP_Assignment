 Can you add me as a trader in Enpower under Ercot Asset?    Also,  please add Alex McElreath as a trader under Teco Services.
 Additionally,   Alex is not able to get into Lotus Notes and, ultimately,   East Power Scheduling Discussion.  
 Jeff Miller needs access to East Power discussion - he has Lotus Notes.
 
 Thanks,
 JMF
