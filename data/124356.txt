 to figure out how I'd manage as a working mom.  Been there, done that, 
 although not with 3 kids, but it's definitely manageable.  Fortunately, 
 Brigette is old enough to manage for a few hours after school with the kids, 
 until I get home.  My issues would be finding something structured for 
 Christian and Brianna during the summers and arranging transportation to and 
 from school.  Already have some ideas and options.  It's just a matter of 
 committing to one plan or another, and finding out how soon this needs to be 
 arranged.  How does my resume look?  Do I need to polish it up for the "big 
 wigs", I know it should look more professional.  Are you still thinking a 
 temp. position or sending me to the other office for something more 
 permanent? Still think you need me in your office though! - Christina
