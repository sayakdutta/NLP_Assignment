 Hi Dear Son,
  
 Thank you for the invitation. It sounds like Shanna has planned a nice romantic dinner for two.  I am sure it will be lovely.   Let's all get together next week and have an informal family celebration.  Is that o.k. with you?  Love you, Mom

 How about we all go to dinner at Mark's on Sunday night?  How does that sound?

 Hi Eric,
  
 It looks like Enron employees have an enterprising spirit according to the H. Chronicle.  Ebay is saturated with Enron goodies.  This is quite amusing.
  
 Sorry about tonight and we will miss you on your birthday.  We will celebrate whenever you wish, just let us know.  If you change your mind about tomorrow, email me.  Donnita and Jason are coming over for dinner.  We would love for you to come.  
  
 Have a wonderful day.  LU-M
