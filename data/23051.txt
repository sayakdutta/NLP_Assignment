 
 Dalton, I have just returned to the office from a business trip to London of almost two weeks and found your messsage.  I think it would be very interesting to hear from Dr. Brenner.  All the best. Jim 
 
  
     
 	I am mindful that our guest speakers are ordinarily involved in the
 legal profession in some manner.  Due to the May 1st date falling in the
 final days of the legislative session, my efforts to get one of our key
 legislators to speak in Houston on that day have been unavailing (all would
 be anxious to do so at some later date).
 	Consequently, I have tentatively arranged for Malcolm K. Brenner to
 join us that day.  Dr. Brenner is a Professor in the  Department of
 Pediatrics and Medicine, Section of Hematology-Oncology, at Baylor College
 of Medicine.  Among other duties at the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at
 Baylor, Texas Children's Hospital and The Methodist Hospital, Dr. Brenner is
 the Director of the Shell Center for Gene Therapy at Baylor.  My thought was
 that you might find it interesting to hear what Dr. Brenner has to say about
 where we  are and where we are going in the field of gene therapy.  He
 recently made a similar presentation to our Board of Trustees, and it was
 very well received.
 	If anyone thinks it undesirable to depart from past practice in this
 way, please say so.  Further, I will be happy to have anyone else that you
 may suggest join us on May 1st in Dr. Brenner's stead.
