 
 We need your help in completing the following today, per Sally Beck's voice mail message:  
 
 Review your tab in this e-mail to verify the list of retained employees (your name should be in the list as well).
 
 Where applicable, if you have employees designated to go to NewCo, please indicate that on your list (we are striving for a list of employees who will remain with the estate).  
 
 Return a hard copy of your list to Marla Barnard by 2:00 PM today, with your signature that the list is accurate and complete, or with appropriate changes/updates noted.  
 
 Complete a summary template being sent to you by either Kerry Roper or Mike Galvan that will give us your total number of employees (with subtotals for those going to NewCo and those remaining with the Estate) and your total number of employees.  Please complete this by 2:00 PM also.  
 
 Thanks.
