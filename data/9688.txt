 
 I asked Mike this week if your baby was here, and he said that you had just 
 returned to the office.  Congratulations on the birth of your little girl.  I 
 hope that all three of you are surviving those first few weeks of adjustment 
 and that sleep is not too short a commodity in your house!   I will look 
 forward to seeing pictures of Lauren when I am next in London.  You do know 
 that now that you are a dad that it is a requirement to be armed with 
 adorable pictures at all times?!
