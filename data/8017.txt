 
 Thanks for the note.  I will definitely look for you in San Antonio.  I would 
 love to hear about your new role.  We miss seeing you in ENA.  (I guess that 
 is now Enron Americas!)  --Sally

 Sally: Just a quick note to congratulate you on your increased role in the 
 Enron world.
 Hopefully, we'll have a chance to catch-up at the MC meeting later this week.
