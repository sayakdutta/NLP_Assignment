 I don't know of any available nannies but will keep my ears open.  I used a 
 service, Nanny Professionals, and was very pleased with the quality of 
 candidates they sent over (our nanny has been w us for over 5 years).
 
 Good luck on your search.
 
 ps - Thanks for playing last week.  I look forward to playing again after 
 Thanksgiving.
