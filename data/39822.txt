 and EGA, which tracks the org chart of people reporting directly to me.  Deb 
 Korkmas can help you with the proper account numbers.

 Mark:
 
 With the last re-org, I have been told that most of the old EI Legal Groups ( 
 CALME, APACHI, etc.) have moved under your ENA Legal, now known as EWS.  When 
 I do Lexis and Westlaw allocations, would you like me to put all under you 
 cost center or should I separate them out by 12 subgroups?  I retrieved your 
 org. chart from your website.  Please advise your preference and provide cost 
 centers that you would like me to allocate Lexis and Westlaw charges at your 
 earliest convenience.
 
 Thanks,
