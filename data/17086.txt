 We'll need to brief Steve on the fed/state issues tied to the state buying 
 the TX systems of PG&E and Edison prior to his meeting with the Congressional 
 Republicans tomorrow.  I'll be driving with Steve from  LA to Pasadena (where 
 the meeting is) tomorrow beginning at about 9:30 AM PST (the meeting's at 
 10:30 AM PST).  Could we put together a call-in number at 9:45 or 10 AM PST 
 so you could quickly/briefly brief Steve on the issues prior to the 10:30 AM 
 meeting?  Let me know if this works, or if there's a better way to get him up 
 to speed on the issues before the meeting.  Thanks very much for helping to 
 pull this together on such short notice.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
