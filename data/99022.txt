 Project Stanley tapes were destroyed.
 
 NGX is covered - we continue to negotiate a commercial solution which will 
 see EOL data included in the index - had a meeting Friday and we are getting 
 closer.
 
 The shaved head is Powell's deal - can you believe a guy shaving his head 
 just to suck up for a promotion?
 
 Peter.
 
 
     
 Did we ever destroy these tapes?
 Also-- I am assuming that NGX is well covered and that you don't need any 
 help. If not, please let me know. Perhaps I can get info from Mark Powell--by 
 the way is there some sort of fashion trend in Canada invoving shaved heads?
