 
 We are at the MOU stage.  Need to keep off the balance sheet duly noted and 
 emphasized in a commercial meeting last Friday.  Commercial leads at ENA and 
 Global Finance are out this week, so no progress at the moment.  The 
 information I was given is that we want to get it done by the end of 
 September.  How does this sound?
