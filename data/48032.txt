 Tana:
 1. CMS Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company is not on any of my lists as a 
 FERC-authorized power marketer, and we do NOT have a trading relationship 
 with them.  Therefore, this entity is NOT authorized to trade U.S. power 
 products.
 
 2. Allegheny Energy Supply Company, LLC is a current trading partner.  I have 
 a few calls out to see if I need to restrict their access to Enron Sales only 
 and will let you know in a bit.
