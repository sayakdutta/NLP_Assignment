 Kay-Carolyn is out until tomorrow.  She has the originals.  Can you wait
 until then?  If not, I'll retrieve them.
 
 
     
 
 ABB is asking for its original of the facility agreement.  In fact, I need
 to get originals of the ABB and GE facility agreements to ABB and GE.  When
 can I get those docs?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
