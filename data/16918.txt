 
 Sandi's on vacation this week.  There are rumors that PG&E's actively seeking 
 a negotiated solution with legislators and the Governor, but I can't verify 
 and don't have details on what the negotiated agreement might look like.  
 While's Sandi's away, have asked Mona to check in with our Sacramento 
 lobbyists to poke around for information.  Will report back soon as we get 
 more info.

 What is going on with this issue politically?  If PG&E gets its rate cap 
 removed, we need to make sure that this doesn't create more problems for 
 wholesale markets?

 California's largest utility is pushing to end a four-year-old retail rate
 freeze that has protected millions of Northern Californians from the price
 volatility in the wholesale electricity market that  rocked San Diego this
 summer.  PG&E Corp. wants to end the price freeze imposed in 1996 by the
 state legislature because it is losing money under the arrangement.  PG&E's
 move is going to set the stage for a major confrontation between the utility
 and state regulators -- the California Public Utilities Commission will have
 to balance conflicting needs: the utility's desire to protect its
 shareholders from huge losses and the commission's duty as a regulator to
 protect the public from a flawed market that appears incapable of delivering
 "just and reasonable rates required by law."  California legislators fear
 that the state could fall into a recession if electricity prices do not drop
 soon.  California's 1996 deregulation law required all investor-owned
 utilities to freeze rates at seemingly high levels.  Utilities were allowed
 to use surplus revenues to pay down generation-related debts that regulators
 said would render them uncompetitive in a deregulated world.  It seemed to
 work well until this summer in California  --  wholesale prices for
 electricity went up suddenly -- and the average price of power consumed
 today -- for example -- is $ 200 a megawatt hour or nearly four times the
 amount that PG&E can bill its customers.  State Senator Debra Bowen,
 chairwoman of the California Senate utilities committee commented that the
 legislature is reluctant to become involved -- she said further, " [T]he
 legislature feels like somebody who's fallen into poison oak enough times
 that all we have to do is walk past a bush and we break out in a rash.
 That's the way we react to these energy issues."
