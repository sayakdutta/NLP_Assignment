 Can we get together to discuss how best to serve your retail load?     I think this simple process has been complicated by the number of players involved.
 We will give you any structure that you need and provide transparency as to how we do what we do.   What more is there?
 
 I have heard that this could start as early as September,  but we are still a bit short on detail.     If we started in September,  I would envision passing local charges, congestion,   etc to EES.    We would schedule your hedges,  your load and cover any remaining balance (or not) with respect to load zone.
 We would provide scheduling services,  settlements and   24 hour coverage to handle any  contingencies that might occur.
 
 I look forward to working with you on this issue. 
 
 Give me a call when you get a chance.
 
 Thanks,
 JForney
