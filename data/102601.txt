 - utter disappointment.  But yes, it is definitely his loss.  And, I loved 
 the fact that Kevin (his friend) spent so much time talking to my Dad because 
 that had to make Ted feel like a complete jerk (which he is).
 
 I'm am very excited about my trip to London.  The other guy I mentioned in 
 the email, Darren, is going to be working over there for a few months so I'll 
 get to see him there as well.  Plus, in November I'm going to visit my 
 brother and his wife in South Korea which should be interesting.  The globe 
 trotting continues.
 
 Your weekend sounds like it's going to be pretty fun.  I wish I could be 
 there as well, but it is football season so I will be in Austin this 
 weekend.  I've signed up for all these internet airfare specials though, so 
 if some great fares come up for Houston to San Diego I can take advantage of 
 them.  Talk to you soon.

 that's why I never pressed about the past relationships thing (you know, 
 afraid of what I might find out).
