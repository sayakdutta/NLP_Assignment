 
 I have also been meaning to email you.  Unfortunately, I do not have much 
 time to talk with you, I have to head out to alabama unexpectedly, my 
 gradfather is pretty ill.  We were wondering if you guys might want to go to 
 Jazz fest.  THe dates are 4/226-4/30(thurs. arrival, monday departure).  We 
 have about 5 couples going right now and the room rate is $440 per couple for 
 all four nights total.  Let me know if you are interested, we have to have 
 the rooms paid for by 2/15/01.  Talk to you soon.  Thanks.
