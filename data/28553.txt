 
 Please draft up some language that can be added to this policy to satisfy Mike's concern.  Run it by me and we'll send it to Rod.  Thanks df  
 
    
  
 I think one area that needs to be clarified is that many nonVPs believe that if they have the expenditure authority they can sign contracts in connection with the expenditure they are approving even in the absence of a power of attorney. I think we need the policy to clarify the difference between expenditure authority and execution authority. Our various company bylaws state that only VPs and above have authority to sign contracts and bind the company unless the President of the company delegates execution authority. Therefore we either need POAs or delegations of authority for execution authority below VP. This policy needs to clarify this point. I have sent this to Drew and we will work up some new additional language.

 Please review and provide comments to myself and/or Lisa Sutton.
 
  
     
 FYI, based on comments received, attached is the draft which will be distributed to Stan's direct reports for comments. We plan to have the policy in place before the end of March.
