 he must be doing a good job.

 Steve,
 
 Thanks for sending this note to Wade.  I'm certain that the NYT story is 
 infinitely better because of Wade's involvement.  It was a team effort, but 
 you should know that Jimmy Mogal also was very involved.  Of course, Wade 
 wants to avoid damaging the company and your note helps to keep him up for 
 these risky/must do requests.   Along these line,  I'd like to be able to 
 give you a brief update on activities and issues.  I'll check with Maureen 
 about scheduling 15-20 minutes.
 
 John
 
 

 
  
 I just saw the NYT article.  Nice job.  It's nicely positioned as an issue 
 about India's resolve to encourage foreign investment and live up to 
 contracts.
