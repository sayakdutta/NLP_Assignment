 In preparation for the Commissioner meetings later this week,  attached is a copy of the most recent version of the Show Cause Motion.  I am still working on it -- I want to beef up the section on entities already in an ISO/RTO, but you'll have an idea of the concepts we're developing.
 
 Although we do not want to share a copy of the pleading with the Commissioners yet, we thought you should see where we're going on the Motion.  Please call me with questions.
