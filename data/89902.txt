 
 You have the right Kevin Presto.   I have been employed at Enron now for almost 7 years.   I currently oversee the company's power trading and marketing business in the Eastern US.    Unfortunately, I spend entirely too much time at work, but I love the job and Enron's culture in general.
 
 How are you doing?   I have not seen any of my Tri-City classmates in many years.   I think the last time I saw you was at Mark Bayless' wedding (85-86?) if my memory is correct.
 
 Where is your job located and what work have you done with Enron?
 
 
 
 
  
     
 Hi Kevin,
 
 Apologies if this is the wrong Kevin Presto, but I ran across your name
 on the Enron website.  In my previous job, I used to do a lot of work
 with Enron on overseas ventures and was surprised to see your name on
 the website.  Did you grow up in the Tri-Cities, Washington, and attend
 Bethlehem Lutheran School?  If so, I am not sure if you remember me, but
 
 I also went to BLS and was your classmate.
 
 Drop me a line if I have the right person.  Would be interested to
 hear about your work at Enron and what you have done in the interim
 after leaving Washington state.
 
 Chris Engstrom
