 
 I'll be in town.  Let me know the details.  Eric may have trouble.  After the 
 stunt he pulled Tuesday, the Warden's angry.
 
 
 
 
 
 

    
 
 
                                        
 Gerald,
 
 I don't know if Eric has mentioned it to you or not, but I've been tossing
 around the idea of having a couple of the boys over on Saturday evening for a
 grill/booze binge.  Are you going to the 'Horns game?  Let me know your
 availability.
 
 Submergibly yours,
 Ryan
