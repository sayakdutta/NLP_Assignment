 
 The place (outside) is a mess and needs some clean-up (e.g., get all that old 
 wood out of the front yard, whack down the weeds).  Possible for you guys to 
 come up next Wednesday night and we can do a quick clean up on Thursday.  I'm 
 going to try to hire a hauling company to help us and haul it away.  If 
 Cameron has to work are you available?
 
 Best,
 Jeff
