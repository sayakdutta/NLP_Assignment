I suggest you check with the airline or on the internet if you have access (www.trip.com has a great flight tracker that shows more than the airlines tell you) before you leave for the airport.  Since I'll have to check luggage, you can pretty safely assume it'll be 20 - 30 min. after the plane lands before I can hope to be at the curb.

 Hey Mark -- Just checking in so you don't think I have forgotten you. I will
 be waiting in the black Jeep outside of Continental's baggage claim area.
 If I am not right there I might be circling to placate those annoying
 traffic cops.  I won't be late.  My cell is 703-587-9245.  Amanda's is
 703-598-8999.  See you on Saturday!
