 
 Tracy just told me this counterparty (PPL Montana) is still pending credit. 
 Mike Swerzbin said he would prefer to wait this out, because he stands to 
 make money on the deal. So in the meantime, I've been told by credit that we 
 can't enter the deal in the system and calc it. I'm not sure how this works 
 in your case with the Prebon check-out, but basically it's a pending credit 
 deal that will potentially show up in our system once EPMI and PPL Montana 
 reach an agreement. Does that help? Let me know.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate

 Hi Kate, what's the status of this deal?
 
 
 

 
   
    
 
 this deal is contingent on credit - he'll let me know later today whether or 
 not it's a good trade.
 
 thanks,
 Kate

 Prebon sent over a confirm for a deal where:
 Enron (Mike Swerzbin) buys from PPL Montana Cal'04-Cal'06 25 mw of Mid-C at 
 $45.00 off-peak hours.
 
 They did not tell me about this deal during checkout.  Can you please check 
 with Mike.
 
 Thanks!!
