 Hello Michelle
 
 Twanda gave me your name - would it be possible for you to have a quick look 
 through the attached consulting agreement that our new acquisition, MG Plc, 
 wish to enter into with Colorado Global Resources, and confirm that it is in 
 order?
 
 Many thanks.
 
 I have added a Schedule 1 listing the services, and other than filling in the 
 standard gaps I haven't changed anything substantive.
 
 Best wishes
