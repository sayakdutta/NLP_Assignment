 
 Barry sent me a copy of the draft memo announcing his role within EBS.  Since 
 Scott Pleus is currently in that role and does have people reporting to him 
 in EBS that are in trading operations, I would suggest that the memo contain 
 a mention of the transition:
 
 Example:
 
  Scott Pleus is currently Director of trading operations for EBS.  He will be 
 transitioning to an origination role within EBS in mid May as Barry Pearce 
 assumes his responsibilities for EBS.  The current trading staff for EBS will 
 report to Barry effective with his start date in May.  
 
 I also heard from Barry today that Todd Lindholm let him know that he is out 
 of the picture with regard to commercial support for bandwidth trading 
 operations and that Barry will report to John Echols.  So sounds as if that 
 is clarified.
