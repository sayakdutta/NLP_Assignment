 Just a heads up -- pending pipeline board rep approval, Stan asked that I prepare the attached letter for John Somerhalder to send to the GISB office if this is appropriate form.  
 
 
 

  
 
 Joan - thank you for your notice on Shelley and Dale.  Please congratulate 
 them on winning the pipeline segment elections for the Board and EC 
 respectively.  Thanks, Rae
