 In an effort to better serve the Analyst pool here at Enron, the Analyst 
 Program recently
 formed the Analyst Advisory Board.  The charter member of the AA Board are:
 Carrie Southhard, Alejandro Hernandez, Julie Davidson, Erin Rice, Brian 
 Hoskins and David Hunker.
 
 So that we may understand the issues that are important to you, the Analyst 
 pool, we have
 prepared a short survey.  Your opinion is very important to us as it will 
 guide our
 future endeavours.  We strive to make this a better program and your 
 participation is vital
 to our success. Please click the link below to be taken directly to the 
 survey form.
