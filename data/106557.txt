 
 Hello AFAC and Marcelo:  Attached is a recent "short list" of possible 
 products which our traders may be interested in trading in the near future.  
 The list was created by Bruce Harris who resides in Houston but travels 
 frequently to Brazil.  Bruce will join us by telephone next week.  
 My goal is to discuss in depth the memo which you created on October 19, 
 further research (specifically a memo regarding OTC swaps!) and Bruce's 
 list.  Lynn Aven (tax) and Brent Hendry (legal in Argentina) will be present, 
 as will Andrea Bertone.  We will conference in Bruce and possibly others from 
 Houston.  This will be my last message from Houston as Enron will be closed 
 later today for the Thanksgiving holiday and will reopen on Monday, November 
 29.  I'll be in our Sao Paulo office that day.  I'm looking forward to our 
 meeting on Tuesday, November 30 at 2 pm.  See you both soon.  Regards.  Sara

 I am not aware of any products that need to be identified prior to 12/31/99.  
 Going forward into next year, the following products might be of interest for 
 trading.  Our current plan for managing risk is via offshore products through 
 Gary's group due to tax and regulatory reasons.
 
 1. Brazil corporate eurobonds
 2. Brazil Brady bonds
 3. Other country corporate and/or Brady bonds (ie, can a Brazil limitada own 
 an Argentine eurobond?)
 4. Bovespa index futures
 5. R$ currency futures
 6. Local Treasury bills (both US$ indexed and R$ rate) such as BBCs, LBCs, 
 LTNs, NTNs, NBCs, etc
 7. R$ currency forwards
 8. Rules/regulations/tax effects on individual stock trades
 9. Local company commercial paper (typically trades at 105% to 110% multiple 
 to the overnight rate depending on credit).
 
 As discussed, it would be interesting to see what the tax effects are on each 
 type of investment, what margin is required, and what offshore alternatives 
 are available for items #4-8 (the first 3 are bringing offshore items into 
 Brazil, which we might do if there was a tax benefit that could be obtained).
 
 Thanks,  Bruce

 Before my next meeting with the Tozzini lawyers this month, I would like to 
 create a list of SPECIFIC products for managing Enron's Brazilian risk.  
 Bruce Harris is creating a list which he will forward to you shortly.  Please 
 review this list, comment and identify any products required for trading 
 prior to December 31, 1999.  Please let me hear from you if you would like to 
 discuss any issues in particular.  Thanks.  Sara
