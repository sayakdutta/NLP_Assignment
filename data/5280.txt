 but Sheila - or so he tells me.  Now, I, on the other hand.  Uhhhhh .... 
 wait, never mind!
 
 I am free pretty much every day for lunch this week, I won't know until later 
 in the week about next week. 
 
 
 
 
 
 

    
 
 What does your schedule look like this week and next week?  So, does michael
 like my sis or what?
 
   
             
 
   I hope you were only thinking good things!
   I had a pretty good weekend.  I got to see my extended
 family in Fairfield.
   Did you ever meet my cousin Chuck and his wife Shelley?
 They have the
   cutest kids (Becca and Cullen).  So, I spent a lot of time
 with them.  I
   had fun at your birthday party!  When do I get to take you
 to PF's for
   lunch?

   Yes I did.  I was just thinking about you.  I'm really glad
 you showed up.
   I'm also sorry to hear about your grandma.  I will keep her
 in my prayers.
   I had a fun and relaxing weekend, and I'm really glad you
 were a part of it
   :-).  Did you have fun?
