 Dear Mark Whitt,
 
 Thank you for your recent order via our website. Fortunately, we were able
 to change your shipping method before the package shipped. It will now be
 shipped via expedited ground, and should arrive in 5-7 business days. This
 will change the total cost of your order to $79.40.
 
 Unless you choose another method, all web orders are shipped SURFACE (via
 Parcel Post). This is your most cost effective shipping option (unless time
 is a factor), because it's based on the very low "bulk" rates Sierra Trading
 Post is able to negotiate due to its huge shipping volume.
 
 If you would like to specify another method of shipment, please remember to
 do so in the "Shipping" choices section during check-out, or place a note in
 the "Comments" section. 
 
 Thanks for shopping with us. We appreciate your business.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Vici
 Customer Service
