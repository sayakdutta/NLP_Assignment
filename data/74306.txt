 Friday, December 28 
 5:00 - 8:00 pm
 1432 Vassar
 
 Please bring your families, a bottle of wine or champagne, and a dish of your choice.  
 
 I will serve a honey baked ham.  Please let me know what you would like to bring so that I can make sure that we don't end up with 8 dozen brownies or 6 pecan pies and no salad or appetizers!
