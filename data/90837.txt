 
 I jsut left a msg for Kay , we might go out Friday to Sunday 
 
 when are you going for the tent ??
 
  
     
 She is going through her annual Kevin needs to make more money so I can stay
 at home feelings.  Other then that, everything is good.
 
 We are leaving Saturday the 17th and returning on the 20th via Continental.
 It is still cheap to buy now.  I think we are on flight 1097 going and 579
 for the return.  We are staying at the Monte Carlo again.  160 for the first
 night, then 89, then 59 or something like that.   www.monte-carlo.com
 
 We are going shopping Sunday for our tent.
 
 Later,
 
 Kevin
