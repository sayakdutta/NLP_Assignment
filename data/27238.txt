 Sub.) 
 Cc: Conto, Jose; Roycourt, Henrik 
  Calculations for 2002 CSC/CM Zone Determinations are planned to be started on August 1 and must be completed by Oct 1 (protocol requirement).  The power flow base cases are currently being prepared by ERCOT ROS Steady State WG.  ERCOT System Planning staff is already gathering and setting up data files for these calculations.
 Before calculations begin and due to two months being available for determination, we are planning a kickoff meeting with stakeholders as follows:
 When:  Tuesday, July 31, 2001 
 Time:  9:00 AM to 4:00 PM 
 Where: Austin ERCOT Office (MET Center) 



 We are looking forward to the meeting, your discussion and input into the 2002 detemination process. 
 Thanks Ken D.
