 
 We need to finalize.  Legal opinion needs to come from Mark Haedicke (my 
 recollection is that he may not need the back up).  Have we requested the 
 guaranty?  Thanks.  Sara

 Sara,
 
      Any progress on getting a guaranty, legal opinion and a corrected
 certificate of the secretary for me?  I will forward the executed master to
 you with my attached docs once I receive these docs from you.
 
 Thanks
 Chuck
