 
 Dictated letter from Ken Lay
 
 Dear John:
 
 I enjoyed your recent e-mail.  I also appreciate your kind comments 
 concerning our broadband activity.  The deal with Blockbuster has been a 
 great deal of fun and is opening up all kinds of additional opportunities.
 
 I enjoyed looking through the agenda for your meeting in Sweden.  It looks 
 quite informative and interesting.  Sweden is also an excellent place for a 
 summer conference.
 
 The young man you refer to in your letter should send his resume to Celeste 
 Roberts at (713) 853-0555.  If he would also copy me on the letter to 
 Celeste, I would be happy to follow up and make sure it is carefully 
 considered.
 
 I'm delighted that your life appears to be going very well at the current 
 time.  I hope our paths will again cross in Aspen or elsewhere in the not too 
 distant future.
 
 Warm regards,
 
 Ken
