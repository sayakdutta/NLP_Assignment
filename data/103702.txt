 Further to our telephone discussion today with Jason Peters who I couldn't 
 find on email. I did some checking around. The clause (which incidently 
 normally has a paragraph (d))seems  to be only found in the CBA Agreements. 
 Its purpose is a little uncertain. If the Broker was holding a Client's money 
 then by law he must account for it. 
 
 The reason why there ARN Ambro may be reluctant to accept the clause is 
 because the instances it addresses would probably fall within the definition 
 of an "undesirable market event" under the SFE rules. This would trigger 
 action by the Board of SFE to sort out the mess. It may uncertain as to how 
 these contractual would fit in
