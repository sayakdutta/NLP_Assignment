 Through my discussions with Rebecca I have discovered the following:
 
 1.  Regarding the transformer, the contract counterparty is "ABB Power T & D 
 Company"
 
 2.  The purchase price of the transformer ($786,000) was taken from the WLB 
 financing book and does not include any of the capitalized interest charges 
 or option payment (total $56,803) allocation that Global Finance has included 
 in the calculation of the Payoff #.  The full cost of the transformer would 
 be $842,803.
 
 3.  The purchase price of each turbine ($14,072,000) was calculated as an 
 average cost based upon a spreadsheet provided by GE.  This price does not 
 include the $280,000 in change order costs allocated to each machine.  The 
 full cost of each turbine should be $14,352,000.  The $280K in change order 
 was picked up in the original payoff # prepared by Global Finance.
 
 Ben has not yet reviewed any of the values in 2 or 3 above or the current 
 payoff # determined by Global Finance.  I will talk with him first thing in 
 the morning.  We will call you to confirm the correctness of these values.
