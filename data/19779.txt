 Hope your holiday was restful and relaxing.  A week or so ago, there was an article in the clips about Enron partnering with a muni (in Canada maybe) to provide retail energy services for the munis retail customers.  Could someone in your shop try to dig that up?  I need to get it to a CEO of a California muni for EES and I'll be darned if I can't locate it!  Greatly appreciated.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
