 Gentlemen:
 
 Attached for your review is a draft of the Schedule to the ISDA Master 
 Agreement.   
 
 FYI:  The ISDA Master Agreement is a preprinted form for which the Schedule 
 supplements, and such form is not able to be emailed.  Therefore it is not 
 attached to this transmission.
 
 We look forward to your comments.
 
 
 
 
 Cordially,
