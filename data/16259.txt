 Attached is a memorandum from Ellison & Schneider summarizing the California
 EOB's FERC Bid Cap Complaint and the CALPX's Proposed Tariff Amendment on
 bid caps.  Interventions are due Sept. 12 and Sept. 18, respectively.
 
 Recently, IEP forwarded a Restructuring/Transmission Task Force
 solicitatation seeking to raise funds to help fund IEP's intervention in
 matters such as this.  To date, IEP has received two responses.  In the
 absence of significant funding, IEP will be unable to utilize consultants to
 help in the monitoring and filing of interventions in
 restructuring/transmission matters.  We will endeavor to continue to keep
 the members apprised of key issues through the use of in-house staff, but
 resources will be limited and may make the preparation and filing of
 interventions difficult.  For example, IEP is unlikely to file an
 intervention at the FERC in response to the EOB and CALPX filings given time
 and resource constraints.
 
 If you are interested in funding additional support in this effort, please
 respond ASAP to the solicitation distributed in August.  Thank you.
