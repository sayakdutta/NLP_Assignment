 Following up on my voice mail.
 
 Chris Calger is looking for the underlying documentation for the swap between Enron Natural Gas Marketing Corp. and Chase entered into on April 9, 1999.  A similar swap was entered into between the American Public Energy Agency and Chase on the same date.
 
 A transaction diagram for the transaction is attached for your reference.
 
 Please call either Chris or me with any questions.
 
 Thanks.
