 A herd of buffalo can only move as fast as the slowest buffalo. And
 when the herd is hunted, it is the slowest and weakest ones at the back
 that are killed first. This natural selection is good for the herd as a whole,
 because the general speed and health of the whole group keeps
 improving by the regular killing of the weakest members. In much the
 same way, the human brain can only operate as fast as slowest brain
 cells. Excessive intake of alcohol, we all know, kills brain cells, but
 naturally it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first. In this way,
 regular consumption of beer eliminates the weaker brain cell making the
 brain a faster and more efficient machine.
 
 And that's why you always feel smarter after a few beers.
