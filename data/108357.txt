 Jeff, 
 
 I'll call you later today to talk about Bob Rose at Bank America.  He's been 
 trading crude with them for a while, and I believe he's well respected in the 
 market.  He might be in the market for a job, but wants to keep a low 
 profile.  
 
 If we have a fit for him, he could bring a lot of value to Enron.
