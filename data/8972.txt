 
 I would like to participate in this focus group, however, I will be returning 
 from Austin on Friday morning following the Enron scholarship dinner the 
 night before.  I am scheduled to land at Hobby at 8:45 am.  It is unlikely 
 that I will be in the Enron Building before about 9:15, and I am scheduled to 
 go into a meeting at 9:30 that involves a number of players and would be 
 difficult to reschedule.  If your responses from participants for the Friday 
 session is thin, and you schedule another time, please let me know.  
 
 I have been out of the office on business for the last several days 
 (recruiting at UT yesterday) and returned mid-morning today to a full 
 schedule.  I am just now reading your e:mail and therefore could not respond 
 by noon today as you had asked.  --Sally
