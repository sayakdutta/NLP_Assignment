 Yes. I shall try to call you later this morning. I had a schedule from hell
 the last few days.

 All
 
 John Sherriff has suggested we all get together in the near future to discuss 
 the demands being placed on the Research Group.  I will be making a request 
 for additional resources, and the aim of the meeting is to determine the most 
 appropriate size for the team.
 
 Assistants:  Can we aim for week commencing 6th November?
 Vince: Would you like to teleconference in?
 
 Many thanks
 Steve
