 
 I don't know off the top of my head where they are?  Is there a blue file?  Do I have a memo in my memo directory where I sent them to Contract Admin?
 
  
     
 
 Hi Marie
 
 Any idea where I can find the final docs for this deal?  Cynthia said she gave them to you -- I've looked in the regular places -- where else can I check?
 
 thanks
 
 Tracy
