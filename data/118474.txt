 
 As you know, I will be out of the office next week.  I will have the cell 
 phone with me:
 
    011 44 7881 512 535
 
 but unfortunately no way to recharge the thing after Sunday morning and no 
 guarantee that it works in the Virgin Islands anyway.  I suggest that if you 
 try that number and do not get an answer that you NOT leave a message there.  
 It will be much more likely to get to me if you leave it here at the office 
 (x37459).
 
 There will be a cell phone on the boat, however, and I will call Taffy  
 (x57373) Monday morning with the number.
