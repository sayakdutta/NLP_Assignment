 As agreed on the 5/31 conference call, Enron will prepare an annex discussion
 draft which incorporates comments provided to the group.  Anyone wishing to, may
 send me comments on the intial draft prepared by Bill McCoy last winter by JUNE
 6.  Enron's discussion draft will then be prepared based on comments received
 and circulated for further discussion.
 
 The collateral group agreed to meet in Houston on July 31.  I would like to
 schedule the Drafting Committee meeting either on the 7/30 or 8/1.
