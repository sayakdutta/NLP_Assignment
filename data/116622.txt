 
 This deal is a placeholder for our futures position that rolled off 
 yesterday. We're awaiting our counterparty match-ups, which I asked Jason 
 Fischer about yesterday. He said the broker wouldn't have those until today. 
 I'll let you know once we've changed the deal accordingly.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
   
  
 There is a deal titled NEW COUNTERPARTY.  Do you know what the name is 
 supposed to be?
 
 Thanks!
