 
 Ina,
 
 Is there something I need to do in regards to this email.  I appears some coding information needs to be filled out for my cell phone.
 
 Thanks, 
 Susan
 
  
     
 
 
  
     
 I'll bet it does belong to the other Susan.  I've never signed you up for Cingular Wireless.  I do have other PrimeCo bills from before you came to the department that I do need to complete that expense report.  We just got instructions today on how to get into the new "upgraded" system (XMS).  I will process these as soon as possible and pass them on to Legal for approval.  If I have any trouble, I'll let you know.
 
 If I have to learn another password around here, I'm gonna croak.................(just kidding). 
 
 
    
  
 Linda, I checked this out and it is an invoice for Cingular Wireless for 80 some-odd dollars.  I do not have Cingular service; my mobile phone is from PrimeCo.
 Have you had any trouble getting my PrimeCO bills processed?
 Did you order any service for me from Cingular?
 Just asking because I think this e-mail might have needed to go to the other Susan Scott.
