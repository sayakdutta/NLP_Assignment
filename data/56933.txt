 Sorry, I cannot help you on this one.
 
 I already cover a number of campuses.

 We've had a last minute cancellation of one of our 2nd round interviewers at 
 Harvard and wanted to know if you would be interested in interviewing.  Our 
 offer/acceptance rate has been extremely dismal at Harvard and would like to 
 get you involved for the summer internships.  We have a pre-interview 
 reception on Friday, 3/2/01and Interviews on Saturday, 3/3/01.  1st rounds in 
 the Morning and 2nd rounds in the PM.  If you are unable to participate, 
 could you possibly recommend someone at a very senior level of management to 
 substitute?  Thanks.
