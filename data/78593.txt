 Attached please find the latest Salmon Energy Turbine Agreement (second
 document below), as well as a blackline (first document below) showing
 changes made to the version circulated on April 2.  This version
 contains Lee's changes to Exhibits A, A-1, B and B-1.  No changes were
 made to the Maximum Liability Amount, Purchase Amount or Unit Liability
 Amount. Power System Stabilizers are included in the scope.  To complete
 the agreement, we will need to insert the date of execution and Exhibit
