 
 Robin,  Attached is the revised letter.  I added that Enron North America 
 Corp.  was performing these efforts.  (If an entity other than ENA has the 
 contract with Gordonsville, the letter should be changed to reflect the 
 proper entity.  I removed the discussion concerning demand for cover from 
 Citgo.  Per our discussion, we don't have that right under the contract, and 
 since our contract is best efforts, Gordonsville doesn't have the right to 
 demand cover.  I think this letter should be strictly a notice out of curtesy 
 to Gordonsville.  I am going to be leaving, but you can call my cell phone if 
 you have any questions.  (281) 772-9250.
