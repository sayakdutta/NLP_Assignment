 
 Carl,
 
 Depends if it is more like financial or insurance type hedging.
 
 I shall leave it to Vasant to decide.

 Vince, thank you for the response.  In the interim, we met with Vasant 
 Shanbhogue yesterday and explained the deal and what we needed.  Should 
 Vasant continue to work on it, or would you still like us to loop in Zimin 
 Lu?
