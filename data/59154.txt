 Siegal is available for Friday morning.  I'm to receive a tape today or tomorrow.  I'll run it by you so you can compare Siegel to Stelzer.  
 
 
     
 
 Yes.  Irwin knows Enron and is very amusing
 
 
     
 
 Steve,
 
 I'm looking into Siegel's availability now.  Do you consider Mr. Stelzer a strong alternative to Freund or Siegel?
 
 
     
 
 
 
 
     
 
 Freund is very good, but Siegel is more on top of things; his book is very 
 good. I am better than both and wouldn't have the nerve to charge you.    
 Irwin
