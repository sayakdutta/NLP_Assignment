 Debbie Moseley called me a few weeks ago about the Mt. Jesus drip.  Oneok is not giving NNG Btu replacement for the hydrocarbon liquid being hauled from the Mt. Jesus location.  The imbalance is approaching $60,000, and Oneok seems unwilling to change their position.  Oneok claims that the hauler is not paying them for liquid, but is writing water on the ticket.  I sampled the liquid and sent Oneok (John Hanna) a copy of the analysis, showing the liquid as drip, not water.  In the past, I know that we did not push Oneok on this issue because of the Bushton measurement dispute.  Now that the Bushton measurement dispute is near settlement, should this Mt. Jesus issue be addressed?  There are at least two other Oneok liquid issues that need to be addressed:  1.  Oneok is receiving payment at Hemphill #3 for liquid, and this gas does not go to Bushton (Sammy Williams may have more detail on this issue).
 2.  Sublette liquid is condensate, and it is being called water on the ticket.
 Do you have any ideas on how to proceed?  We do not seem to be able to get the issue resolved at this level.  Thanks.
