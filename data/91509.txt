 Hey Karl!
 
 great to hear from you.  someday we will talk - maybe today?  not sure if you're still in, but i'm at my desk.  number is 403 974 6946 
 i believe it is the same country code as US, but not sure.  
 
 it's been bad here at work for the last few weeks and its going to take awhile for things to get better, i'm just hoping it doesn't get any
 worse.  it was very dicey for awhile - thought ene was going tits up.  
 
 spanish desk sounds great!  say hi to kristian and paul for me, but we should catch up by phone, if possible, so i'll leave it there.

 p.s. snow is just falling on the mountains and i'm getting excited for some good skiing.
 
  
     
 Hey, how you doing ? Still hanging in there ? Is the snow on the mountains yet for Skiing ?
 
 Back in London slowly getting to grips with the changes that have taken place, not quite visible at first...
 
 I am working with Paul again on the Spanish desk along with Kristian and things are a little interesting in the market.
 
 Been limited to plugging things together with Excel and not much database creativity, more analysis, which is good but a bit limiting at times with the internal Police preventing flexibility !
 
 Are you in the office today, I have a question for you ?
 
 Karl.
