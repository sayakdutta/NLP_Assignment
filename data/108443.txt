 
 Thanks for the note.   We are still looking at the value chain, but think we 
 may have an idea.  I think Mike and I learned a lot from you guys when we 
 were in London.  Nobody thinks our speculating in the grain markets does much 
 for us, and is probably the wrong way to run that group.  Interestingly, the 
 cargill CEO hasn't met with us yet.  We have been trading softs, but very 
 small.  Next time Gary Hickerson is in London, which should be soon, I'll 
 have him give you guys the story, and ask for more of your input.  
 
 Regards

 goodday Jeff,
 
 wonder if you have update of Enron's initiatives into grain-trade...
 what did CEO of Cargill wanted in that meeting few weeks ago ?
 
 recently got some calls from former Cargill colleagues, it rumors fly around 
 in that company that we are about to start trading softs tomorrow...they are 
 also interested in stealing some EnronOnline ideas
 
 best regards
