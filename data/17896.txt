 that it's a whole heckuvalot less than the May 1-December 31 exposure.

 Could be.  What is our post-12/31/00 exposure?

 Interesting bit from SCE's MOU (p. 31) -
 
 "the CPUC Implementing Decisions shall include
 
 Orders resolving the responsibility of SCE to provide credits to direct 
 access customers in respect of electricity deliveries after December 31, 2000 
 in respects which do not result in any material financial detriment to SCE; "
 
 Translation:  I suppose this means SCE is looking for an order absolving it 
 of any responsibility for PX credits after 12/31/00, but implicitly, that 
 seems to suggest they accept responsibility for PX credits before 12/31/00.  
 Do you agree?
