 Thanks for the update.  I have been given a green light as well to go ahead 
 and start testing my traders deals.  Let me know if you just need TAGG deal 
 numbers for testing purposes, or if I need to rebook deals myself in your 
 test version in order to compare it valuation with the valuation in my excel 
 models.  
 
 Thanks,
 Susan

 Susan, Matt,
 
 I was told by Zhiyong last week that he had a green light for the Gas X Gas 
 spreads in Enpower. Have any of you hear anything about it? At this point I 
 have sent some needed changes in the "front end" to Duong Luu, and I'll be 
 ready to test when these changes are done. If any of you still have a "hold" 
 on this project please let me know so we can get all cleared up.
 
 BTW, I've been moved to the 25th floor, desk EB2519a.
 
 Regards, Marcelo
