 Thanks so much for your good wishes.  I really value your opinion and 
 consider you a major asset to the swap group (I actually give myself a "pat 
 on the head" for being able to entice you to join the group).  I look forward 
 to lunch next week.

 I just wanted to finally congratulate you on your well-deserved promotion to 
 AGC!  I am really, really happy for you, as you are one of the primary 
 reasons why I have chosen to stay in this group.  I would like to take you 
 out to lunch to celebrate and will ask Suzanne to get in touch with Kay to 
 get a date that is good for both of us.  Again, congrats on a tremendous 
 accomplishment.
