 
 I left you a couple of messages with two different assistants today for you=
  to call - am sure that it is a busy Monday.  I will send this note so that=
  I don't forget the purpose.  With Savita assuming the role previously play=
 ed by Sheri with regard to the Product Control group, I wanted to underscor=
 e the importance of a free flow of information between the EOL team and my =
 operations team.  One of the roles that Sheri's team fulfilled was keeping =
 my risk and operations teams apprised of any changes within EOL that can ha=
 ve an impact on bridging to our legacy systems.  I may have met Savita once=
  in passing.  I checked with Jeff Gossett and Stacey White, risk leads over=
  gas and power, respectively, and neither one has heard of or met Savita.  =
 Although Jennifer Denney will play an active role, I know that she will be =
 out on maternity leave soon, so it is important for Savita to know the righ=
 t players on the operations team and for them to know her.  I will contact =
 Savita directly to make the appropriate introductions.  I just wanted your =
 support and encouragement for Savita in making the right connections within=
  operations.  --Sally
