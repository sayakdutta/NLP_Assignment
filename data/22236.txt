 message; however, I will hold back judgement until we discuss the strategy in 
 more detail.

 Alstom ESCA is holding "Summit 2000" in Las Vegas Oct 16 - Oct 17.  The 
 purpose of the meeting is to bring together people from throughout the 
 industry to discuss key issues.  
 
 Alstom ESCA is a French company that builds EMS systems in the US.  They 
 developed the EMS for Enron's control areas.  We are working with them on 
 Project e-trans (the RTO software).
 
 The first panel in the am on Monday involves Re-regulation and Competition.  
 They would like someone from Enron to present and participate.  Right now, 
 they have  Pacificorp and are trying to get someone from government in PA and 
 CA.  The presentation / speech is 10 - 15 minutes followed by 30 minutes of 
 Q&A for the panel.
 
 Do you have any interest in presenting?  This could be a good opportunity to 
 deliver our message throughout the industry.
 
 Please let me know.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Jim
