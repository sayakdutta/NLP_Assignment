 Michelle,
 
 The new program still needs final approval by the Enron Corp. board of
 directors.  The design was tentatively approved last month, subject to final
 review.  The following revised provision should serve you well in the
 meantime:
 
 
 
 All-Employee Stock Option Program
 
 Enron Corp. has previously awarded stock options to full time and part-time
 regular employees in designated domestic and international locations through
 the All Employee Stock Option Program (AESOP).  Stock option grants were made
 under this program to eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2000.  The
 grants represented value for the time period of 12/31/94 through 12/31/00 or
 a pro-rata portion if hired after 12/31/94.  Subject to final approval by the
 Enron Corp. board of directors, a one time award of non-qualified stock
 options under a replacement program is proposed to be made to eligible
 employees as of December 29, 2000, in value equal to 25% of annual base
 salary (5% of annual base salary for a 5-year period; salary valuation and
 value may vary in some international locations).  Program awards are subject
 to and effective upon the approval by the Compensation and Management
 Development Committee of the Enron Corp. Board of Directors.  Such stock
 awards will be made pursuant to the appropriate Enron Corp. Stock Plan as
 determined by the Committee.  The exercise price for grants of stock options
 will be determined according to the provisions of the Stock Plan under which
 the award is granted.  The program may or may not be offered in certain
 domestic and international locations based upon management discretion and/or
 local labor and employment laws.
