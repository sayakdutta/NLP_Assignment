 
 I didn't want this just popping up on your screen.  
 
 So far it's just getting worse!!!  I've already been up there three times 
 today and of course each extra trip lowers the P&L.  He must think I'm the 
 biggest idiot in the world.  I'm going to have to change my name to get 
 another job after he fires me.  When he saw me standing outside his office 
 this last time he just spread his hands like what could possible be wrong 
 now!!  
 
 If you want to make a lot of money and are willing to take this job back 
 now's your chance.  I think John would pay you $100,000 to take back over.  
 
 Talk to ya later,
 Robin
