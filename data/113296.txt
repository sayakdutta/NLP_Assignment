 Where does this stand?  I just read the text and agree with Harry.  Most importantly, the HHI may not be suitable given the high degree of regulation of ComEd service.  
 
 As important, I don't think the ICC cares too much about Enron losing market share.  Not the best lead argument.
 
 Let's talk.

 Janine - this is getting insane.  With all due respect to Marc, this has nothing to do with the issues at hand.
