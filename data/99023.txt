 Mr. Sanders: 
 ?
 I note from our accounting records that our invoice dated  November 9, 2000 
 in the amount of $124,313.68 on the Project Stanley file  remains 
 outstanding. 
 ?
 Would you mind tracking this invoice down to determine if  there is any 
 problem with payment of the account as we would like to clear this  matter up 
 as soon as possible.
 ?
 I appreciate any assistance you can give us on this  matter.? If you require 
 another copy of the account, please let me know and  I will forward it to you 
 by fax. 
 ?
 Regards, 
 ?
 that we could rectify to speed up payment or,
