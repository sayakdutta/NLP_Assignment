 
 Bob,
 
 I have attached an Excel file that values Pete Keavey's Gas Daily swaps and 
 options.  In looking at the spreadsheet that you sent, I found these to be 
 the most incorrectly valued.  In order to get the valuations, I had book 
 administators run calculations in the ERMS system.  These values should 
 correlate with how credit valued these deals.  The file consists of a summary 
 worksheet for each month and a detail worksheet for each month.  Please feel 
 free to call, or have Homer call, with any questions that you have.
 
 
 
 
 Thank you,
