 Elizabeth, is there a contact person for Sempra Energy?  (Please see below.)  
 If you do have a contact person can you have your assistant forward that 
 information to Rosemary Ryan will ISDA so they can invite people from Sempra 
 Energy to the meeting.  Many thanks.

 Janette,
 
 Attached is the memorandum regarding the North American Energy and
 Developing Products Committee meeting which will be held in Houston on
 October 10.  We sent this out to all the Enron contacts by fax early last
 week.  In addition to Mark (Haedicke) can you let me know if there will be
 other representatives from Enron attending the meeting.
 
 Also could I ask for your assistance in locating a contact name and
 phone/fax number that we should forward this invitation to at Sempra Energy.
 
 Thank in advance for your help.
 
 Regards,
 
 Rosemary
