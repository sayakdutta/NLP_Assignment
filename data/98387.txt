 Richard, could you provide me with some information on where we are with the 
 retention policy?  My last understanding from you was you were going to work 
 on the wording a bit and then get back with me.  As you can see below we are 
 at risk from a legal perspective on these cases until we get this policy in 
 place.

 Here is yet another request for e-mail from a long time ago.  Apparently EI 
 has these old tapes somewhere (at least Roberto and the users think they 
 do).  Any word from Richard Sanders?

 2.  Also, the following people from Black & Veatch worked in the EECC Houston

 Ms. Brownfeld indicated that the document review by Enron's outside counsel

 Please let me know if you have any questions or require addtional information.
