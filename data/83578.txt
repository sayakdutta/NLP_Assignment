 I am out of the office this entire week on vacation, so I will be unable to 
 participate.

 Hello LSU Team!!!
 
 As you know, we will be conducting summer intern interviews on March 15th and 
 16th.  We did not have the opportunity due to conflicting schedules in the 
 Fall to have a cultivation dinner.  I am scheduling a dinner for the Full 
 time candidates on March 15th around 7:00 PM to have this dinner.
 
 If anyone's schedule permits other than the scheduled interviewers and 
 greeters to attend please let me know.
 
 Thanks a million!!!
