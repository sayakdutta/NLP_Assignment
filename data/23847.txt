 Lindy:
 The next parts that we will need some help on in the TW business plan is -
 
 1) Risks - contract rolloffs and competitive threats
 2) Growth opportunities (e.g. TransPecos, Sun Devil and the Bakersfield projects)
 3) Marketing strategy
 
 I have attached an updated Business Plan. Please insert your thoughts in the appropriate section - it may be helpful to talk about it first!
 Thanks,
 
 Kevin
