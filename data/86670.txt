 Joe and Brian: my favorite case may require that I work a full day on
 Friday 
 and leave with Brian friday afternoon. If I need to do that, I would
 greatly 
 appreciate it if Joe would agree to stop by the golf cart place to pick
 up 
 the new batteries. Please let me know if this is agreeable joe. e.
