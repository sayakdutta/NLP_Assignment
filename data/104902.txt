 Brazil from 8/17-8/20.  However, I'll alert Carol St. Clair to the 
 possibility of a call.  Sara

 As we discussed earlier today, Chris Foster is in the process of analyzing 
 the economics of the proposed derivative structure to determine indicative 
 price,term, etc., and Catalytica is considering whether the structure meets 
 its requirements. The attached draft ECT/GE agreement should give you some 
 useful background and other details about the transaction. Thanks for your 
 assistance.

 Attached is the latest revision of the agreement for your review and comment.
 
 With regards to the Catalytica/Enron agreement, we are still working with 
 Catalytica to come to agreement on an acceptable structure for both parties.  
 However, the basic agreement as it stands is that we are working on a spark 
 spread derivative structure which 'mimics' the macroeconomics of Pastoria as 
 much as possible (e.g., 750 MW, local spot PX prices and gas price, etc.) but 
 would not have any contractual link to the project.  Under this agreement, we 
 would always have the right at any time to buy back the spread for 10 MMUSD, 
 or exchange it for the XONON credit if we could not use it at Pastoria or at 
 another Enron project.
 
 We are working with the West desk to come up with a indicative price for such 
 a spread so we can begin to craft an agreement which we can then pass on for 
 your further review and comment.
 
 Keep you posted...
