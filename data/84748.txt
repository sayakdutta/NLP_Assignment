 last couple of days.  I will review and get back to you tommorrow.  Thanks.

 Mr. Nemec,
 
 Did you receive the latest WIC supplement dated 10/12/99 ??
 I read it and didn't have any problems with it. It gives us VOLUMETRIC firm 
 rights at 80% of the max. recourse rate on the excess ramp up volumes.
 
 The supplement letter agreement has Enron Capital and Trade Resources Corp. 
 which can be crossed out and changed - I talked to WIC about this already.
 The FTSA has Enron North America Corp.
 
 Let me know.
 
 Mike
