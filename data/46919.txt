 
 Mark Haedicke just got back today.  I'm sure he's been putting out fires this 
 morning and Janette will get back to me as soon as she has a change to chat 
 w/him.

 Were you able to locate the number?
 
 
 

 
  
 We believe the password would have been sent to Mark Haedicke.  He will be 
 back in the office tomorrow and Janette will try and locate it for us when he 
 gets in.

 Tana:
 Last week Mark circulated a memo concerning the new ISDA Opinions that are 
 now available on the ISDA website until the end of January.  Can you find out 
 what our ID and Password are so we can access them?  Given Mark's illness, 
 I'm not confident that this is something that he will be able to look into 
 before the deadline.
