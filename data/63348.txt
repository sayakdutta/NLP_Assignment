 Western State Power Forum: May 22 and May 23
 
 Plans are proceeding nicely for the Western State Forum on May 22 and May
 23.  We have an outstanding group of confirmed speakers and panelists
 including many individuals that I assume you know as colleagues and friends.
 I will be sending you more information on the Forum in the next few days. I
 am going to send you the preliminary agenda  this morning.
 
 You will be speaking at a critical time in the Forum; that is, just after
 panels on power problems and polices and just before the final session
 linking power and energy strategies to environmental objectives. It would be
 great if your talk to the participants in the Forum could help them see the
 relationship between power and energy related objectives and environmental
 issues including GHG emissions. You should feel free however to focus your
 talk in a manner of your choosing. Again, I will send you the prelim. agenda
 soon.  Could you send me a title however for the final agenda's purposes?
 We hope to print the final agenda later this week.    Thank you.
