 
 Paul,
 
 I have made revisions as discussed to the Master Agreement.  However we need 
 to include on "Exhibit A" info regarding  "Invoices, Payments", etc.    You 
 may either send me this information or correct the document at your 
 convenience.   
  
 Please check the final revisions,  and if in agreement please print two 
 originals sign and forward both to my attention.  Upon final execution,  I 
 will send an original for your records.  
 
 Thank you for  your attention to the foregoing.    
 
 Regards,
