 not be possible (i.e., may not be enforceable)  with any of the French 
 counterparties even if you have an ISDA in place.  If netting is not a 
 concern, then we can have separate and unrelated transactions.  Are you going 
 to push an ISDA for SITA?   Let's discuss.  Michael will have to encourage 
 his counterparties to respond to our French counsel; SITA never did.  Sara

 Please prepare a draft ISDA based on the attached credit worksheet. Please 
 deliver draft to Michael Moulton. Sara, this is another French company.
 
 Thanks,
