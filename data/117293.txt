 ??????? Please find attached, for your review, Amendments to each of the 
 currently outstanding Delta Notes, together with forms of Consent to such 
 Amendments. These Amendments are needed in order to ensure that the Delta III 
 transaction does not violate the negative covenants of the oustanding Delta 
 Notes. Note that I have also attached a blacklined document with respect to 
 each Amendment (the current version blacklined against a composite document) 
 in order to highlight the alterations made to the definitions in each of the 
 Delta Notes.
 
 ??????? Please note that these documents remain subject to further internal 
 review.? The Remainder of the Delta III documents will follow.
 
 ??????? Please direct questions or comments regarding the attached documents 
 to Mike Dunn at (212) 530-5435.? Best Regards.
