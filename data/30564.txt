 
 ETS  103
 PGG  28
 EREC 53.2
 Azurix (not including Marlin) (5.2)
 Clean Fuels (21.1)  I need to double check this one this morning.
 
 We talked about EGAS yesterday.  Its their 2nd CE plus ( in this case minus) the assets we have picked up.  We will review updated 4Q with Stan on Tuesday afternoon.
 
 I will have to check with EEOS unless you already have.
 
 Sorry for the delay, I had to talk to Rod.
