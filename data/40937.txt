 can loan money to Enron.     Have you filed to be able to make the
 special dividend?

 I do not have any access to information regarding PGE retained earnings.
 
 
 As we discussed this morning, distributions of cash in the form of
 dividends will be subject to a tax of approximately 7%.  This tax can be
 avoided completely if the distributions of cash take the form of
 intercompany loans which are settled at the close of the sale of PGE.
 Significant tax research and intercompany briefings took place on this
 very topic in July and August of this year.  The procedures for
 settlement of the loans are already baked into the PGE purchase and sale
 agreement. It is my understanding that some loans of cash have already
 been made under this procedure, but I am the wrong person to talk to
 about PGE issues or that sort.  Rod Hayslett would have more
 information.=20

 Jim Ginty is the appropriate tax department contact for PGE Purchase and
 Sale Agreement issues.=20

 Alicia,
 
 Do we know / can we quantify the amount of undistributed/retained
 earnings as of Sepetmber 30th, and what the tax impact would be of
 distributing that amount.
 
 Thanks again.

 I had heard something similar.  We should probably get alicia to
 quantify exactly how much the leakage would be {in dollars} and how the
 mechanics would work.  Please tell alicia that we understand that this
 would be a whalley, mcmahon, causey decision.  We are only trying to
 identify options and quantify breakage and leakage.
 
 Thanks very much for the update keep me posted.
