 
 Hey guys,
 
 in light of my quickly approaching 26th birthday I wanted to invite you all to dinner on tuesday October 2nd. I hope that nice company (and plenty of alcohol) will help me to forget about my age for at least one evening.
 
 So, what do you say? 
 
 The place: Buca Di Beppo (Massimo can translate it for you), 5192 Buffalo Speedway. Map is attached. The place is really nice, not too expensive and a lot of fun. I think we could reserve a private room.
 
 Time: October 2nd  7:30PM.
 
 Please let me know if you can make it so I would know the exact number of people.
 
 Hope to see y'all there.
 
 Vlad.
