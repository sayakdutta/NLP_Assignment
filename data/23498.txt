 Hi Jim,
 
 Well, it's been quite a month!  I hope the dust is clearing for you a
 little bit, at least.
 
 The results of our email poll of Executive Committee members for our
 inaugural meeting are as follows:
 
 a)  Friday, January 11, 2002 -- all can make it except McNamara, Kryder
 and (maybe) Green;
 
 b)  Friday, January 18, 2002 -- all can make it except Kryder and
 (maybe) Green;
 
 c)  Wednesday, January 23, 2002 -- all can make it except (maybe) Green.
 
 Shall we go ahead and nail down the meeting date and circulate it so the
 folks can lock it in on their calendars?  What day do you choose?
 
 Thank you so much for finding the time to manage this matter, as you
 have, amid all the other matters on your plate.
 
 David
