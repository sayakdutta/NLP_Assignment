    There are rumors around here that all the employees going to the new
    company
    - UBS Energy will be taken off of the Enron servers tomorrow.  If this
    is
    true, I do not know what or when my email service at work will be back
    up.

    Thanks.
    Hope all of you are doing well.
    PL
