 
 Kim,  Attached are the revised documents for Palo Alto.  The documents are 
 revised to reflect the deal term comments that the City forwarded.  I changed 
 the name of the document to Natural Gas Services Agreement to address their 
 concerns about a non commodity agreement.  I have also added language 
 requiring a City Council resolution to for this document.  Instead of a legal 
 opinion, we would require the City Attorney to approve both the Natural Gas 
 Services and Transaction Agreements.  In included a redline of the services 
 agreement from the prior version.  The Transaction Agreement would not 
 redline on MS word for some reason.  I will request my assistant to redline 
 it for you on Monday using comparewrite.  If you need help prior to my 
 return, please coordinate with Jeff Hodge.  Please forward these documents to 
 the City if you are okay with them.   Thanks.
