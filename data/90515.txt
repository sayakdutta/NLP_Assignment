 
 The following people will be making the trip:
 
 Portland			Houston
 Tim Belden			Kevin Presto
 Mike Swerbzin			Fletch Sturm
 Bob Badeer			Dana Davis
 Jeff Richter			Rob Benson
 Tom Alonzo			Rogers Herndon
 Matt Motley			Don Black
 Mark Fisher
 John Zufferli
 
 Could you please coordinate with aviation to arrange the Falcon 900 to pick up the Portland crew Friday morning with and then confirm flight details with myself and Tim Belden.   We may have to arrange for Don Black and Rogers Herndon to fly on commercial flight due to space limitations on the Falcon.   Let me know if 14 is over the limit so I can let Rogers and Don know.
 
 Thanks.
