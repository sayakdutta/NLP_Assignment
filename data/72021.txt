 I'll check on pushing the meeting back to 930 to give you a chance to get 
 downtown before it starts.  Sheila, what do you think?

 The earliest flight gets me to Houston at 8:33.  Is that sufficient time
 to get to your offices, or should I plan on flying in on Thursday night?
 Also, it is my understanding from participating in the conference call
 last week that the meeting is scheduled to last no more that 2 1/2
 hours.  Is that still the plan?  
 
 
     
 
 
 900 central, so you should be in decent shape.

 I can be there. Please let me know what time the meeting will begin. I
 would like to fly down early that morning, if possible.
 
 
     
 
 Hi Pete,
 
 Would it be possible for you to be in Houston this Friday morning for
 the
 GE meeting?  It would be great to meet you in person, and have you
 participate.  What is your availability?
