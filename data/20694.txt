 Hey Guys,
 
 Just wanted to let you know that the Holiday Party at my Parents house will
 December 8th.  As always it will start at about 10:30am.
 
 I will send out invites in a week or two.  Please do not mention the party
 to anyone not on this list as my mom will only let me have a limited number
 of friends over to play.
 
 Sean
