 I can initial it. Please, contact Beth Perlman as an IT officer.
 I shall explain the reason we are buying the software to her.
 
 I want the software to reside in our London office - the software is used
 primarily by European utilities and we shall use it as a pricing tool
 in negotiations with European clients.

 Vince, I am circulating the D-G Energy Software License Agreement for 
 signature.  I need for you or your Senior Director to initial and I also need 
 to know if you have identified an Enron Officer within IT to execute on 
 behalf of Enron Corp.  Please let me know.
 
 Thanks,
