 reports.  Sometimes it is tough to have all assistants out at once.  To meet 
 at 3:00, you all would have to leave around 2:30, which could be early in the 
 day for some groups to lose assistants.    Would it work to start a little 
 later in the afternoon?  If before 5:00, I think that all assistants will 
 have to check with their managers on the convenience of an earlier departure 
 time.  --Sally

 Hi Sally
 Hope you had a great Easter!
 Are you okay with us leaving the office early on Wed May 3rd?
 Sometimes it is hard for some to break for lunch and others can't do a dinner 
 after work.  I thought mtg at 3pm would be inbetween.  And give everyone a 
 chance to relax without thinking about coming back to work.
 I wanted to check with you before I asked for RSVP's.
 Thank you
 Lynn

 Hi Ladies,
 If you don't know already, Patti Thompson (Sally's Assistant) is now an 
 official Enron Employee!!!!  Yeah!!!!!  I couldn't be more pleased and would 
 like to arrange a get together to welcome her to our group!  Plus, we haven't 
 all gotten together for awhile!  Instead of having lunch or dinner, maybe we 
 can meet in between.
 
  How about this? 
 Little Papasito's (on Westhiemer and Kirby) or Tilah's (on West Dallas)
 Wednesday, May 3rd
 Meet at the restaurant at 3:00pm
 There is one thing about this. . . .no returning to the office!
 (It hasn't been decided whether to go to Papasito's or Tilah's, place your 
 vote!)
 
 I  would love to accommodate as many assistants as possible.  So if this 
 conflicts with many of your schedules, we can be flexible on the date.
 Please let me know what you think as soon as you can.  I'll keep everyone 
 posted!
 Lynn
