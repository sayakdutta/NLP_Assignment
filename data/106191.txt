 crew).  Lawyer Burlingame was unavailable when I called to wish him the best, 
 and of course, he has no email address.  Maybe a joint belated call tomorrow?

 I called him today but it was too late.  He was problably on his 3rd
 bottle of champagne at Galatoire's.  Can you make it in for a belated?
