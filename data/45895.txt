 The address in Paris is the central address from their invoices.  Toulouse is 
 a regional office when we find some of the meteroologists are based.
 So contractually I think Paris is porbably the best reference.
 Hope this helps

 Michael Corbally just wanted me to confirm the following with you.  Per the 
 list of Datasources you sent me, for France we've got Meteo France listed at 
 the Paris address.  We had a confirm earlier this year using Meteo France 
 where we used their Toulouse address.  I just wanted to confirm that the 
 address we want as the standard address will be the Meteo France out of 
 Paris, not Toulouse.  If you'll just confirm that for me.
