 PG&E has asked to make a presentation to the Creditors' Committee at our 
 meetings in San Francisco on Tuesday, May 15, 2001.? The presentation, which 
 is expected to cover a wide range of pending issues, will start at 10 am and 
 will last for approximately one to two hours.? Please see my earlier email 
 for the full agenda, location and call-in information for the meeting, which 
 will still start at 9:30 am and should last most of the day.? 
 
 Regards,
