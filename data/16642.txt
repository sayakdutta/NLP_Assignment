 
 P.S.  Nice use of "birthday" as the segue to the deal. =20
 
 Speaking of birthdays, Prentice has informed me that, despite my=20
 protestations (being a very low-key sort of guy), there "must" be some part=
 y=20
 for my birthday this year (which I'm still opposed to--and I may be in=20
 Houston that MONTH anyway). =20
 
 I was thinking (cuz I hate spotlights), that it might be fun and interestin=
 g,=20
 since your Dad and I are both hitting interesting birthdays this year, if w=
 e=20
 had a joint party---double the people, double the fun.  (I don't know if he=
 'd=20
 rather have a solo party for his, though.)  And since my dad's met your dad=
 ,=20
 but our mom's ain't been in the mix,  I though it might be a good (and=20
 hopefully safe) atmosphere to get them together in. =20
 
 Am I smoking crack on the whole idea?

 Sorry for surprising you this morning!!  Nothing wrong with being
 comfortable in your birthday suit.
 
 Speaking of birthdays, I think we should have a goal to get my company
 acquired by your company by May 30, 2001.  Good goal, huh??
 
 I want to talk to you about the details I have been thinking about while yo=

 were gone.  When should we talk??  Let=01,s set up a meeting so we make sur=

 move this all forward.
 
 Welcome back.
