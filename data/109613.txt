 
 Blake, I've reserved one of our Falcon 900s for the trip, too.  It seats 12 
 passengers.  Please let me know departure time on 10/20, and return time on 
 10/23 when that has been determined.  Thanks, SRS
 
 
 
 











  
  
 
 Ahoy,
 
 Admiral Monteleone and I have been working on the arrangements for our
 upcoming forum trip.  When we arrive in Nassau, both boats will be waiting
 for us at Atlantis.  Consistent with prior events, this trip should be
 outstanding.  Bill and I will present a proposed agenda on Monday night.  We
 welcome your input.
 
 -Blake
