 
 I had actually called you before I had seen this email.  I wasn't involved in 
 the NOx emissions deal.  I don't think legal was involved at all, at least 
 from a Compression Services perspective.  Mark Courtney was the deal maker 
 for Compression Services and I believe that John Scarborough, an analyst was 
 also involved.  
 
 Let me know if you can do lunch tommorrow and I can tell you exactly how 
 exciting my weekend was.  See ya.

 Hi.  How was your weekend?  Did anything wild happen while I was away?  On 
 another note....are you familiar with a NOx emissions deal between 
 Compression Services and our emissions trading desk that was originated last 
 year?  I need to talk with those who were involved so I'm nailing everybody.  
 Let me know. thanks
