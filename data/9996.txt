 Lynn,
 I've also enlisted Mike Rasmuson from Northwest Pipeline to talk about his
 pipeline's experiences with the problem.

      Todd, sounds good to me.  Iike that better than a formal presentation.
 Thanks. Lynn
 
     
                 
    Lynn,
    I don't think the discussion will be too formal.  I was thinking that
    you
    could introduce the topic by talking about the history and background
    and
    the situation it has put your pipeline(s) in. Our goal is get people to
    understand the root of the problem, get them to understand how different
    pipelines are affected by the problem depending on far they are from the
    supply. Then we could go around the room and ask people about their
    experiences with the problem and how they are dealing with it.  What do
    you
    think?

         Todd, I'll be glad to lead the discussion.  Is this informal or do
    I
    have to
         have a formal presentation?  Thanks. Lynn
 
        
                             
       Lynn,
       We lost our discussion leader for the "mismatches during ID2" topic.
       Are
       you interested in leading a discussion on this issue?  I think it is
       important as there is no GISB solution and we have to deal with this
       everyday.  Kathy Royal was going to discuss El Paso's solution, but
    all
       of
       the El Paso and CIG people had to cancel.
       Thank you,

          Todd, I am looking forward to the meeting in October as well as
       meeting you.  I wanted to let you know
          ETS would like to add one more person to list for the meeting.
       Theresa Hess is now in the ETS Gs Logistics
          group and I think it would be beneficial for her to attend.
       Please add Theresa on any future emails.  Her

       Sheryl, I think you are all booked up for the
          Sunday activity, but Sheryl put Theresa on the list in case of a
       cancellation.
 
          One topic I wouldl ike to talk about at the meeting:  is the
       "mis matches" across interconnecting
          pipelines at the Intraday 2 cycle.  This is still a concern for
       the Enron pipes and I wold like to know
          if anyone has come up with any "great" ideas on minimizing these
       mismatches.  If you would like
          to discuss further, please call me (713) 853-7637.
 
          Have a great day and I look forward to seeing you on October 21.
       Thanks. Lynn
