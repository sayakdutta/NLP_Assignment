 
 No buddy.  Thank you.  And I'll take you off campus for lunch next week too.  My treat.  Maybe I'll invite my work wife, Judith.  I'm thinking about
 	Luling City Market on Richmond - BBQ
 	Cafe Express on West Gray - great burgers
 	Berryhill Taco's - Westheimer at Kirby
 	Ryans Steakhouse - poor man's steakhouse and buffet off 290 outside the loop.
 
 I'll have to decide next week what I want to feed you.  Of course you have a say, a small one anyway.
 
  
     
 thanks for everything
