 
 Chris,
 
 Here is our explanation of the 5 Day loss violation.  Let me know if you need 
 any more information.
 
 Due to a forecast for mild November weather, futures prices have fallen 
 sharply over the last five days.   Nymex futures prices have fallen a total 
 of $0.68 over the last five days.  The Gas desk's loss is primarily driven by 
 a long price position held by the Financial desk, which averaged 7, 295 
 contracts over the same period.
