 
 I really  do not think this a great week for me time wise - I'll try but I doubt I will manage it.
 
  
     
 He's on the Executive Impact & Influence course on 6th & 7th November and Marcello being Marcello has been a bit tardy in selecting his raters (well, I actually ended up doing once he'd told me who to pick!).
 
 The thing is because he's picked the minimum no. of raters it's important that those few give the feedback on him - yep you've guessed it, you're one of the few.
 
 Apparently the feedback needs to be done by Tuesday so please may I ask you to do your best to give feedback on him.
 
 Thank you and I hope you & the family are all well
 TTFN
