 
 I requested some birth certificates about 3 weeks ago.  Can you tell me if the request has been processed.  I faxed in the request with my credit card number.  The transmission came back that you received the request.
 
 The request was for William Monroe Donohoe (3/14/96) and Claire Louise Donohoe(5/18/98).
 
 They were to be mailed to Thomas C. Donohoe at
 		4702 Gladesdale Park Lane
 		Katy, TX  77450
 
 Please call me at 713-853-7151 if there are any questions .
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Tom Donohoe
