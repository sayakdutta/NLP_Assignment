 
 I've changed deal 547478 to reflect the correct price - $109.90 off peak and 
 $174.15 on peak - and made a note in our deal correction report. Please keep 
 me informed on any discrepancies you run across. I'll be happy to look into 
 it.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate

 Kate, I am working with Brooklyn Couch with EES on the March power activity 
 and she has a deal referring to the schedule received from you.  Deal  # 

 schedule $174.15 & $109.90.
 
 I spoke with Virginia and we agreed that variances which are listed as part 
 of the schedule I will forward to you.  All others will go in to DMS.
 
 Please let me know what you find out.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Mark
