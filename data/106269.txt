 Kirchhofer (why doesn't "Compagnie de Papiers Stadacona" show up on the 
 corporate database).

 Sara,
 
 Have you had a chance to look into this?  Per Stuart, this company is owned 
 by Enron.  We bought it outright, with the intent of putting into an 
 off-balance sheet company.  I'm not sure if that part has happened yet, but 
 we theorize that when we entered into the hedge, it was still fully Enron 
 owned.  Bob Crane would really like to get this resolved, so if you could let 
 me know your thoughts, I'd appreciate it.  Do I need to check with Rhett 
 Jackson in tax as well?

 Sara,
 
 Are we able to do FX deals with the company shown below?  Also, would this be 
 an RMT confirm or an ENA confirm?
