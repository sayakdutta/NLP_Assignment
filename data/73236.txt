 
 Hi Rebecca,
 
 I'm trying to locate the sig pages for the NW guaranty.  These were the docs 
 that I approved after I had approved the letter agreement.  These signed 
 pages weren't with the letter agreements and change orders you brought me.  
 To you remember if you brought them to me before?  I haven't really searched 
 - I thought I would ask first.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
