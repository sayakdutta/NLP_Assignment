 
 I need to have an Outlook public calendar folder created to track maintenance shedules on West Region pipelines for the West Gas Trading Desk.  Patti Sullivan (psulliv) and I (msmith18) would need administrative rights.  Can you please direct me to the appropriate people to have this set up.  I can be reached at 3-0472.  Thanks.
