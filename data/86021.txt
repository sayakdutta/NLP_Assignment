 
 Stuart,  I have reviewed your comments and incorporated as appropriate.  Please review attached.  The following are my comments on your changes that I did not accept:
 
 1.  The replacement of Section 3.1 and 3.2 with Section (a), (b), etc.  is confusing, but unfortunately the September 1, 2000 amendment already made this replacement.  I am  staying with that format.
 
 2.  Since the Original Agreement was awkardly amended in September of 2000, I think the references to the "Original Agreement as amended by Amendment #2" are helpful, so l retained them.
 
 Let me know if you have any questions.  I am OK to send this to Dow if you are.
 
  
 
  
     
 Attached are my comments.  Obviously, I haven't reviewed the original lease so I am providing comments from a less than optimal vantage point.
 
 Regards
 
 Stuart

 Attached is a draft of the Dow Amendment.  I used portions of their proposed amendment which they sent of August 8.  Date and prices are left blank for negotiation.  Let me know if you have any questions.
