 
 Thanks very much Rosalee.
 
 Karen:
 Do you have a copy of the Dow Jones article?  I'd like to email the piece to 
 Brulte, if you don' t have any objections.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 1.  Just wanted to let you know that not every Californian agrees with our  
 Attorney General. 
 2. Read with interest a Dow Jones story regarding about a 4 page proposal  
 Enron gave to Speaker Hertzberg allowing large commercial customers. 
 3.  Would love to see that proposal. 
 4.  Thanks.
