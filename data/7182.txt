 
 I have a standing staff meeting that I attend on Monday mornings, so I will 
 not be available when you and James meet on the 8th.  I will look forward to 
 getting with James after your meeting for an update.  
 
 
 
 

    
 
 Sally,
 Just wanted to give you a quick status report on where we are to date. We
 have had two meetings postponed with James, but we are scheduled to meet
 again on Monday, January 8th at 9 AM. We will review and revise the written
 description our approach and James wants to share that with you after the
 meeting. If you are available on Monday, your input would expedite the
 review and revision process tremendously.
 Thanks,
