 
 In case you haven't done it already, please cross out the note on your 
 calendar that today is the day the Conoco trial starts!  What better day to 
 announce a celebration of the settlement, since without it many of us would 
 be sitting in a courtroom in Midland wondering whether the trial would last 3 
 weeks or 30.   With that image firmly in mind, please plan on joining us for 
 a celebratory dinner on Thursday, August 17th at 6:00 at Brennan's.  Again, 
 thanks for all of your  efforts on this case, and I hope to see you on the 
 17th!  DF
