 Symes,
 One more index. This is the one I would like to participate in...if it works.

 Kysa,
 
 This is the methodology on the hourly index.  Please forward on to Bill and
 have him look at it for his comments.  The methodology will be the same for
 all the other indexes.  We would ideally like to launch this index by mid
 December.  Let me know if you have any questions.
 
 Cheers,
