 
 Tanya:
 
 Our FX desk has requested an ISDA Master Agreement for ENA's FX trades with:  
 Credit Suisse First Boston, London Branch.
 
 The entity with which ENA already has an executed master (effective 4/21/93) 
 is Credit Suisse First Boston International, which trades derivatives.
 
 I will have the name of the CSFB lawyer this afternoon.
 
 Can you please prepare a credit worksheet?  Thanks.
