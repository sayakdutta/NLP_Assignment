 how to proceed with this past due account.  There seems to be a lot of
 misunderstanding about this that needs to be cleared up.  Johnson say "the
 Young's are due to be cut off today."   Also in a copy of a letter they
 sent to me they gave the Young's your work phone number (Richard).  Was
 that OK?  I do not want Johnson giving out my work number to any customer!
 Maybe if the Young's would just sent a partial payment we could get to the
 bottom of all of this?
 Let me know if you need me to do anything.  I can fax you copies of what R.
 Johnson sent me if it will help (give me a fax number) or you can call me
 this morning before 10:00.
 
 Thanks,
