 
 Per Steve's request, I am forwarding a phone number of a consulting company 
 that produces maps which show all pipeline in Texas (sorted by county).  This 
 might be a good place to start to find the pipeline you described in your 
 voice mail to Steve.
 
 The company is Design Technics Corp.  Phone: (713) 460-2291.  The map will 
 generally show where the pipeline runs, but it is depicted at more of a macro 
 level.
