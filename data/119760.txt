 it looks to be on Thursdays at 8

 I was looking in the TV guide and did not see where it is on this week let me know if they changed the date and time.
 
  
     
 um.....no....sorry - i guess he is why you are watching?
 
 aren't there good looking boys on the island?
 
  
     
 Have you seen Ben on Felicity?
 
  
     
 i don't understand how you put Felicity on the same level at TI2...
 
  
     
 I am a desperate person for entertainment-what can I say.
 
  
     
 that is horrible - i am embarrassed for you...

 I'm not sure I'm going to watch it.  None of the people really interest me
