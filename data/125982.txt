 Does this information reflect the additions of the IBOC or not? Otherwise the info seems to be what is going on right now.
 
  
     
 Attached is what is apparently a revised export level chart that discloses export levels relative to intra-Alberta load.  Are we in a position to agree/disagree with these figures and/or provide any comments back to EAL?

 Dear All,
 
 In keeping with work-overload-tradition the wrong attachment was added to

 > Review of EAL Policy OP-333

 > ESBI Alberta Ltd (EAL) and the Power Pool of Alberta (PPoA) have, upon
 > request, reviewed the Alberta to BC Hydro export transfer levels.  The
 > levels, shown on the curve in TA-OP 333 on page 13, and tabulated by the
 > PPoA in POB - 12, have been reviewed to more accurately reflect transfer
 > levels and show a smoother transition especially at the lower end of the
 > export curve at 150 MW.  The review does not show transfer levels which
 > deviate from the curve published in OP-333 and does not reflect any new
 > information regarding the interconnection to BC Hydro.

 > Confirmation is required from stakeholders, and we request a response by
