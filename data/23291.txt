 Jim,
 
 I work in Government Affairs, supporting EBS.  I have been working with Steve Bowen of Blumenfeld & Cohen on issues in California relative to EBS as well as negotiating interconnection agreements with SBC.  Jeff Dasovich and Scott Bolton worked with Blumenfeld & Cohen prior to my entry into EBS issues.
 
 Because Steve Bowen has recently broken away from B&C to form his own law firm, I was wondering if I need to get approval to work w/ Steve in this arrangement.
 
 Please advise.  Thank you.

 we are trying to tie up loose ends with Blumenfeld & Cohen, and they
 have
 asked for written verification for clients that have switched their
 legal
 matters to Bowen Law Group.  I've attached a short letter for that
 purpose.  If
 you are comfortable with the wording, please put the letter on MFN
 letterhead,
 sign and fax a copy to us (415-394-7500) and mail the original to the DC
 office
 at the address on the letter.  I'd greatly appreciate it if you could
 fax the
 letter to us today if possible.
 
 Thanks much.  Anita.
