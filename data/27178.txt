 I believe we discussed the 'static sch fees' that they (HL&P) apply to schedules coming in and out of their system.  These fees are separate from the ERCOT fees and actually ERCOT itself does not have anything to do with them (meaning they do not track the fees at all, the fees are handle at the counterparty level).  I will try to track down the last invoice that Reliant sent to us for these fees, it is a separate invoice from the regular invoice, so that we can review it.

 Michael,
 we checked with Reliant personnel and they dont know anything abuot the fees that we discussed.     That's not suprising,  however.
 Does Reliant bill this directly or does the Ercot ISO bill this to us?     What is the reason for this fee?
 
 Thanks,
 JMF
