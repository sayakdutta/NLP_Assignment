 
 Ken:
 
 Mark H. asked me to forward to you this initial draft term sheet.  We would 
 like to talk to you, and presumably one of your colleagues, tomorrow 
 regarding the possible antitrust implications of the proposed structure.  
 Please give me a call and we can schedule a time.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Mark
