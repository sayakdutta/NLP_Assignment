 working with me, starting on January 29th in Houston.  --Sally 
 
 I am in London this week, but if you have any ideas Patti can follow through 
 while I am out.

 Sally,
 
 Beth's assistant is wanting to know where Beth will be sitting - where they 
 are to ship her boxes.  Any ideas or anything you want me to do regarding 
 this?

 Hi Patti,
 
 This will probably be the first of many emails in the next couple of weeks.
 
 Do you have a location as to where Beth will be sitting over there?  We'll be 
 packing up her boxes soon to ship over and for future post etc.
 
 Also, she will need a new extension number.  She would most definately prefer 
 an 853 number and if you can use her VP status to help her get one if they 
 refuse (her words) then that would be great.  Her old number was 853-5521 
 although someone else may have that now.
 
 Thank you for your help.  It is very much appreciated.
 
 Janine
