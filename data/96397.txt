 I have it on very good information that the Credit Dep't is staging a 
 "workathon" this week and Bill B. has promised Elizabeth that if we give her 
 our top 5 CP's for whom we need credit input/info (credit worksheets, 
 follow-up calls, etc.) - we will have the information we need by the end of 
 the week.  Some in Credit have even brought their sleeping bags to the 
 office. They appear to be taking this very seriously! 
 
 So..... Elizabeth asked that we each give her the names of our top 5 
 Counterparties for whom we need Credit input/info. We need to give her the 
 names by 10 am tomorrow (Tuesday).
