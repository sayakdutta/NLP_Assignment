 Happy New Years!  I miss corresponding with you.  Take care and write soon.  
 If you ever plan a visit to Houston, you have an open invitation at my house.

 Dear Greg,
 
 It's good to hear how well you're doing.  As you may know, I left John and 
 Joe to become the Office Manager in Madrid and I'm really enjoying it.
 
 I was talking about you and Jay to the guys here the other day and telling 
 them what a loss it is for them not to have met you.
 
 You're one of a kind and I'll always remember you!
 
 Hasta luego
 
 Iris
