 Thanks again for the invitation last night.  I had a great time.....
 
 I  have called Michelle Marvin to let her know that I will be happy to speak 
 at the Wharton conference.
 
 Barbara and I would enjoy having  you and Lisa over for dinner sometime in 
 the next few weeks.  Please let us know what would be convenient for you.
 
 All the best,
 
 Tom
