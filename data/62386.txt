 I may be in Vegas that weekend.  I'll let you know it that changes.
 
  
     
 Laura is currently scheduled to be in Houston for Unify testing on April 26 through 30th.  I'm overdue a trip to Houston, so I could schedule a trip around the same time if that timeframe works for you, either Saturday, April 28th or Sunday the 29th.   We're going to be a bit rusty since the courses up here aren't open yet.  Let me know what you think.
