 Excerpt from an article on espn.com
 
 Given Kentucky's decades-long legacy of cheating in both basketball and 
 football,
                   ousting Mumme was a mandatory move. The school's image is 
 too fragile to
                   countenance keeping a coach with major violations on his 
 watch.
 
 Enough said.
