 
 Valery,
 
 I may be in Dallas in the next few weeks. 
 I shall probably come to Dallas one Friday.
  I shall let you know well in advance.

 Dear Dr. Kaminski,
 
 I would like to apologize for the delay responding, I was on vocation.
 
 Thank you very much for your interest in my work and for your suggestion to 
 meet
 for lunch/dinner. I will be truly happy to do so. In this regard could you
 please let me know what day might be convenient for you. Since I am going to 
 fly
 from Dallas, I would like, if possible, to plan it in advance.
 
 I look forward to hearing from you and to seeing you soon.
 
 Sincerely,
 Valery Kholodnyi
