 Diego" (April 2001) 
 PWP-082 by James B. Bushnell and Erin T. Mansur
 Retail electricity rates in the San Diego Gas & Electric service territory 
 more than doubled over a period of three months during the summer of 2000. 
 Much of this increase was subsequently rescinded through a retroactive rate 
 freeze. We examine the impact of these events on overall consumption levels 
 in San Diego. We find that average electricity consumption decreased by 
 roughly 55 MW, or 1.6%, between mid-July and the end of August. Demand was 
 reduced by over 6% in the late afternoon and late evening. Because of the 
 uncertainty about the duration and the credibility of the rate increase, 
 these results should be viewed as a lower bound on the demand reductions that 
 could be achieved through pricing incentives.
