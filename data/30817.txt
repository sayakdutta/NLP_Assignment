 great thanks

 Secondary non-recallable, you can use $.14 year round
 
 OR
 
 $.05 for Apr-Oct which is probably a little high and $.15 for the winter.
 
 The non-recallable factor is the hard thing to figure in.
 
 
 
 
 

 
    
 
 Can you help me with capacity prices on TCO to put in our pricing models?
 I
 need Apr-Oct '00 and Nov-Mar for deliveries to COH. assume 10,000/d of
 secondary for summer and 20,000/d for winter. Please call if you have
 questions.
