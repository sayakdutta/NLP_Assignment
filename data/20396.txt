  Testimony 
 
         Jeanne,  I understand from Keith Melville that you were looking for 
 various pieces of SDG&E's May 18, 2001 filing in our Revenue Shortfall 
 Surcharge Application (A.00-10-045/A.01-01-044).  I have included in the 
 attached note the entire SDG&E filing.  Hopefully, you will be able to find 
 in the package the information/data you are seeking.  Recognize that there 
 were some corrections made on the stand by some of the witnesses.  I would 
 recommend that you check the transcript for those corrections. 
 
         Also, Keith tells me you also wanted a copy of Exhibit #38.  Jim Hay
 
 will send it to you in a separate e-mail. 
 
         Please let us know, if you need further documents in this 
 proceeding.  Have a great day!

 Attached is the first of three emails with SDG&E's filing  updating the DWR
 revenue requirements.   The following is an excerpt from our pleading.  In
 the next email are scenarios that show DWR surcharge (cents per kWh for
 system, large customers, and small customers)  under assumptions requested
 by the ALJ.    
 
 Thanks especially to Ed Fong, Mohamed Derbas, Bill Saxe, Mike Strong, Keith
 Melville, and Jeff Parrot for key assistance in getting this filing out in
 one-day. 
 
 Based on this filing,  the Commission may (we have no Proposed Decision yet)
 rule as soon as August 23 on an increase to SDG&E rates of approximately
 3-cents to recover the updated DWR revenue requirements.  
 
 If you have questions, please contact me, Lynn Van Wagenen, or Keith
 Melville. 
 
 Excerpt of SDG&E pleading: 
 
 	On August 15, 2001, Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Wetzell issued an
 "ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE'S RULING ON THE AUGUST 7, 2001 REVENUE REQUIREMENT
 OF THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES" directing San Diego Gas & Electric
 Company (SDG&E) to produce updated estimates, including supporting analyses,
 of the system average electric rate increases required based on the revised
 revenue requirements determined by the Department of Water Resources' (DWR),
 as set forth in the August 7, 2001 DWR communication to the California
 Public Utilities Commission.   
 
   
     2001 in A.00-10-045/A.01-01-044 
 
 This email contains the pleading, assumptions, and a summary.  The summary
 is the accurate updated version.

 This and the following two e-mails contain the updated information requested
 by ALJ Wetzell in his Ruling dated August 15, 2001.  The documents are
 spread out over three e-mails because they consist primarily of
 spreadsheets.   In this first e-mail SDG&E attaches its pleading responding
 to ALJ Wetzell's Ruling along with two documents providing the assumptions
 SDG&E used for its updates to Exhibits 14 and 18 and  a document providing a
 summary of all of SDG&E's updated analyses.  In the second e-mail SDG&E will
 provide its updates to Exhibit 14 and in the third e-mail SDG&E will provide
 its updates to Exhibit 18.
