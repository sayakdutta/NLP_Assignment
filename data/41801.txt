 I don't know, all I know is that it was executed in order to get the master netting agreement done with Dynegy.  You might check with Marie Heard since she worked on the master netting agreement.

 I've checked her desk and it's not there and I haven't received anything either.  Did they send it by UPS?

 Apparently they have signed the agreement.  Can someone please check Tracy's desk and see if we have gotten the signed copy?
 
 Thanks,

 I called and left a message w/Steven Smith and response before I went out.  Robin Hill has the information -- not sure what the hold up is, Steven says it's b/c he is trying to find someone to sign the document, but that was almost two weeks ago.

 I still haven't heard from these folks.  I talked to Steven Smith last week on 10/24/01 and he said there were no issues with the MSA, but he was having a hard time finding someone to sign it.  I told Jane this info last week.  I haven't heard back from him either via email or phone, should I pursue this further?  One more call before I go out on maternity leave?  I know Jane is anxious to get this back signed.
 
 Please advise.
 
 Thanks
 
 Tracy
