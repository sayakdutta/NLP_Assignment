 
 All:
 
 Attached are the two (2) final version GTC's.  The legal terminology is 
 identical for each product.  However, Stuart needs to provide a title for 
 each product which will also appear in the Paragraph 1.
 
 The former Paragraph 2 has been deleted (it contained the "confirmation 
 terms") and the remaining paragraphs renumbered.
 
 Justin:  Will you circulate the revised long description (since your 
 conversation with Stuart yesterday afternoon)?  Also, will you let us all 
 know when we are competely done?
 
 Please call with comments as soon as possible.
