 
 Hi Mr. Stelzer l-
 
 I don't believe Ken has had an opportunity to review the suggestions in your 
 outline.  He has a huge stack of mail he hasn't gotten to yet.  Hopefully, by 
 tomorrow, he will have seen it.
 
 Thanks.

 Will do -- and I assume I can go ahead with all of the suggestions in my
 outline. Right? Also, now that you are free of Blockbuster, should you and
 Rupert get together again?
