 "Hello, my name is....."
 You are cordially invited to a Northeast Region Off-site to be hosted by Jeff 
 Ader - NE Origination.  This off-site will allow us to formally meet each

 group for the upcoming year.  Some things we would also like to touch on will 
 be the  responsibility to generate income, provide coverage, deal flow, lead 
 strategy formulation, provide information and generate strategic positions.  
 Come prepared to discuss whatever questions or concerns you may have.
