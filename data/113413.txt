 The Portland office has advised me that they do not sell gas to DWR either.
  
 
      
 no one in the Houston gas side makes any sales-However you need to check with the Portland office-try calling Chris Foster
 
     The state Department of Water Resources referred to in the article.  I don't think it's LADWP.
