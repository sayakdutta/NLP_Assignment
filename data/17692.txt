 
 I was holding back a bit.  All I needed was the green light.  I'll make it 
 explicit.  Thanks for the comments.
 
 I am very ready to start getting the word out.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Looks good.  I think you implicitly say this, but I think you should make it 
 more explicit:
 
 The continued growth of the new economy is threatened by our electricity 
 infrastructure more than anything else.
 The high tech industry requires market driven solutions to reliability and 
 pricing not the old style command and control regulated monopoly approach.
 Let's start getting the word out!

 Attached is a first rough cut.  Work continues but wanted to distribute for 
 feedback.  All is welcome and appreciated.
