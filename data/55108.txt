 Dear Dr. Kaminsky:
 
 Thank you very much for arranging the follow-up interview with your internal 
 clients. I visited Mr. Ted Murphy and his staff at RAC and Mr. Dennis 
 Benevides at EES yesterday. I was impressed with level of risk technology 
 employed by Enron to achieve its business objectives. I want to reiterate my 
 strong interest in joining your group, which is held in very high esteem both 
 inside and outside of Enron.? I look forward to hearing from you.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Rabi S. De
