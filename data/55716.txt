 This may be of interest to you.  I was contacted by Steve Lake from Argonne 
 National Laboratory who  is interested in selling us some of their models and 
 mapping software.  Let me know if there is any interest.
 
 Thanks,
 Beth

 Beth,
  
 I  enjoyed talking with you this afternoon regarding possible Enron/Argonne  
 National Laboratory collaboration. As I mentioned, one of our  divisions, 
 Decision Information Sciences has built state of the art tools  for modeling 
 and simulating energy use. They have trained many country  energy ministries 
 on the use of their tools as well as solved complex energy  technology issues.
  
 I've  attached a presentation which describes some of their capabilities in 
 this area.  Decision Information Sciences also has done much work in studying 
 critical  infrastructure issues in both gas and electric systems which also 
 may be of  interest. Finally, they have been pioneers in the development of 
 agent  based complex adaptive systems for modeling very complex systems that  
 are impossible to view with over approaches.
  
 I will also include a copy of my  correspondences with one of your e-business 
 groups under separate  transmission.
  
 Regards,
