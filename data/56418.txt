 
 Steve,
 
 I am speaking at a conference either on Monday or Tuesday. I shall let you 
 know tomorrow
 the details of my schedule. 
 We can always invite them to visit with Enron in the evening.

 Hi Vince
 
 Do you think you will be able to find the time to carry out some interviewing 
 on Monday 21st February?  Are there any times you'd particularly like me to 
 avoid?
 
 The first people I'm inclined to invite in are the candidates whose CVs I've 
 attached below.  I'd like to hear what you think before I invite them along.
 
 Steve
