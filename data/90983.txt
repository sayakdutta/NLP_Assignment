 Hi Dutch,
 
 I need to schedule an hour with you this week.  You are on the calendar
 this week to meet with Mery, Ann and Laura from 2:00-4:00pm on Thursday,
 October 18th.   Can Sheri and I setup a meeting with you for this Tuesday,
 October 16th for an hour?
 
 Let me know what your calendar looks like!
 
 Thanks,
 Monica L. Brown
