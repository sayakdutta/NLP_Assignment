 
 Ehud,
 
 I shall be glad to serve on the re-defined panel.
 There may be some things I will be unable to comment
 upon due to on-going investigations.
 
 I should finalize my Austin trip plans in a day or so.
 I will let you know.
 
 
 Vince
 
  
     
 Vince,
 
 Greetings.
 
 1.  Per our communications earlier this year, you had agreed to participate
 in a Feb. 22 panel discussion entitled "Future of Energy Trading."
 
 We have now revised the format of the above Conference, so that our current
 planning is this:  On 2/22, from 2 - 5 p.m., at the McCombs School of
 Business, we will have a panel discussion that will focus on
 "Enron/Andersen:  Causes, Consequences and Conclusions."  We will invite
 faculty, Energy Finance Group students, other students, other
 practitioners, and possibly members of the press.
 
 I write to inquire whether your earlier receptiveness to participating in a
 panel discussion extends to this newly-defined topic.
 
 2.  Alternatively, you had mentioned the possibility of coming to Austin in
 early-to-mid Feb. to discuss matters with a smaller group.  I also seek to
 discuss that matter with you.
 
 I would like to call you this afternoon to discuss these two issues.  Best,
 Ehud
