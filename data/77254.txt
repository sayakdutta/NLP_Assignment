 
 Here are my comments:
 
 Revise  "whereas" clauses to make it an option for an easement, not a current 
 grant of an easement.
 
 Should we be able to enter all of Parcel 2 for due diligence, as opposed to 
 just the easement area?  (paragraph 7)
 
 Matt, I wanted you to be aware of paragraph 17.
