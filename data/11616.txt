 Paul Flack asked me to ask each of you if you have received any materials relating to lawsuits about which you have not yet informed us.  Paul's question arises from our learning about a motion that was filed in federal court in Texarkana in a case styled Davis, et al. v. Enron, et al., in which you were named as defendants, and about which we have received no prior notice.
  
 Thank you for your assistance.
  
 Terri Richardson
 Assistant to J.C. Nickens
