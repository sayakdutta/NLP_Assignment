 To celebrate Continental Airlines' new service to Hong Kong (a city known for
 its bargains) you can visit "the City of Life" for only 25,000 OnePass Miles
 (now that's a bargain).  Save at least 50% off the miles regularly needed, but
 act fast--seats are limited and not available on all flights. Read more about
 our Hong Kong Reward Sale at

 Reward Desk at 1-800-344-1411
