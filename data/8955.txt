 Following the initial message about Junior Achievement in March 2000, each of 
 you responded that your department was willing to participate in the Job 
 Shadowing program.  We want to ensure that you are still able to 
 participate.  When you have a moment, please advise.
 
 Thank you.

 Our thanks to those of you who have already responded regarding the Junior 
 Achievement Job Shadowing program.  If you have already replied, it is not 
 necessary to do so again, however, there are still a number of you who have 
 not responded and we look forward to hearing from you.  Please review the 
 memo below and respond to Nicki Daw or Susan Skarness ASAP.
 
 Your participation is greatly appreciated.  Thank you.

 Some of you were contacted earlier this year by Cliff Baxter, Enron's 
 representative on the Junior Achievement Board of Directors, regarding 
 participation in Enron's Junior Achievement program.  Since so many changes 
 have occurred within ENA since that time, we are renewing our request and 
 broadening it to reach more departments.
 
 One of the programs that we wish to support through Junior Achievement is Job 
 Shadowing.  This program's objectives are to demonstrate why a sound 
 education, interpersonal skills, and a strong work ethic are needed to 
 succeed in the work place.  A successful Job Shadowing program requires your 
 department's commitment and participation.
 
 The Job Shadowing program consists of the following:
 
  9:00 - 10:30 AM  Welcome, Company Overview, Video, and Tour 
  10:30 - 12:00 N  Job Shadow Experience with Enron Employees and/or 
 Departments
  12:00 - 1:00 PM  Lunch for Students with Mentors and Closing Comments
 
 Enron has agreed to accept 16 high school juniors and seniors on the second 
 Wednesday of each month from October 2000 through April 2001.  We need your 
 assistance in hosting students within your department during the 10:30 AM - 
 12:00 Noon period.   Students may be either paired up one-on-one with 
 employees or may remain in groups of 2-4.  Employees participating in Job 
 Shadowing will also be invited to join their students for a quick lunch and 
 closing comments.  If enough departments participate, it is possible that 
 each department may only be needed on a quarterly basis.
 
 Although we have identified two individuals to provide the company overview 
 and tour, we are also accepting additional volunteers in this area.  Please 
 advise if anyone in your department is interested in assisting.
 
 Please provide the following information to Nicki Daw or Susan Skarness by 
 August 30, 2000.
