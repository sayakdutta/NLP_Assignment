 I would never do that.  That transmission is not mine.  The only Nevada tranny that I used that day is Enpowered under #'s 702461 abd 704751.
 
 Thanks
 
  
     
 
 
  
     
 Holden,
 
 Do you ever call in NPC (t) with out a reservation.  NPC has two blocks of 400 mw's for the 27th and 28th and I don't know who did it and it is not in Enpower.  It looks like it could have been preschedule with the shape of it.  There isn't anything in the real time sheet.
