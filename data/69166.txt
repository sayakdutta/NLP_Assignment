 deal we have with them.  This volume and price do not match up.  Sylvia does 
 not recall the deal they describe and  has no paper work for it.  ANR Lebanon 
 Ohio does not sound familiar.  The only thing that I can think of is that 
 they send us a confirmation letter/or transcript from the tapes.  If they can 
 prove to us a time and who they talked to we can then pull our tapes.  Let me 
 know how I can further assist you.  Sorry.
