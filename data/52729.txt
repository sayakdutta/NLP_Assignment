 It was a great pleasure to meet you in London.  After our lunch I had interesting discussions with the research group and continental trading group.  How was the response on your lecture/speech?
  
 You mentioned that you could send me an interesting book on derivatives.  I am really looking forward to dive into it.  If you have two copies we may have one for reference and one for in-depth study at home.
  
 You also mentioned that Tom Halliburton or Pereira could give a hands-on course in SDDP.  As I said, I am very interested in such a course some time this year.
  
 Thanks and regards,
  
 Andr? Damslora
