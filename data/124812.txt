 Jon,
 Good to hear from you. Glad to hear you are healing up, as for me, I am still working on the sprained knee. Enough of this one game and out stuff. Do you know when the outdoor season starts? I am hoping to make some indoor games, but want to concentrate on outdoor.

 Hi Guys,
 
 Not sure who is in charge of the indoor team but I noticed we have our first
 game of the upcoming season this Thursday night at 10:15 against FC Cosmos.

 As for me my hamstring is slowly healing so I should be back out there
 before too long.  Later.
