 Greg,  I am a cofounder of Inknowvator Inc.  I live in Houston, actually
 Gene Humphrey and several other Enron folks are my neighbors.
 Our new Idea Manager solution was selected by  Xcelerator to identify,
 develop and select new ventures.  This was put on hold following the recent
 management change.    The Knowledge Management group, then housed in EES,
 had also recommended that we be brought in as an internal solution and as
 an Enron corporate offering.
 
 We are an ideal solution for Enron to identify and develop new business
 ventures, to enhance current products and services,  and to share ideas and
 learnings across the company.  Our solution is perfect for helping you
 manage current organizational changes by engaging all employees to
 understand issues and share ideas through innovation.  We can be up and
 running in less than a month.  This could also be a great innovative story
 for Wall Street.
 
 The solution is being utilized by leading global companies in various ways
 including:
 1.  Strategic planning and new venture portfolio management
 2.  New business, product, and service development
 3.  Corporate innovation programs
 
 We have now implemented or have reached agreement  to implement our
 solution at various clients including:
    Schlumberger
    Halliburton
    ExxonMobil
    Johnson & Johnson
    IBM
 
 Idea Manager is a unique decision software solution designed to capture and
 utilize ideas, information and expertise that were here-to-fore relatively
 inaccessible or unusable.  The solution encompasses the identification and
 development of business opportunities and decision making in a leading edge
 collaborative environment using portfolio management best practices.
 
 I will call to schedule some time. I can give you a high level overview in
 30 minutes.
 
 Regards,
