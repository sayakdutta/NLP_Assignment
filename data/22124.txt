 During the feedback phase you will need to access PEP at 
 http://pep.corp.enron.com to suggest reviewers who can provide feedback on 
 your performance.  You may also be requested to provide feedback on fellow 
 employees, but the system will only be open for feedback until November 17th!
 
 HelpDesk representatives will be available to answer questions throughout the 
 process.  You may contact the HelpDesk at:
