 
 Ian,
 
 I shall come to Wharton on Thursday, June 14,
 meeting with Howard Kunreuther.
 
 I shall ask my assistant to forward you my itinerary.
 I shall also register for the October Conference.
 Thanks for reminding me.
 
 Vince

 A couple of months ago you agreed to serve on a panel on real options that Rita McGrath at Columbia had assembled.
 We have been informed that you have not registered for the conference - in SFO October 21 to 24

 When are you due at Wharton again?
