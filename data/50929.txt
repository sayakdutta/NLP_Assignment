 Can you, please, provide this information.
 Let me take a look at it before it's released.
 
 Thanks.

    city gate gas BY MONTH
 
 Vince  I  am  doing some  advocacy  for  ENA   to  refute a  law suit  about 
 changes in
 gas prices  spiking in  New York  in  Dec 1999 -  Jan/Mar 2000  compared  to  
 Dec  1998 - Jan/Mar  1999.
 
 For the  December   1998  through  March  2000    16 month  period  can you 
 please   have someone in your group
 provide me with a set of  avg  monthly prices for WTI  oil  and NY harbor  
 resid  vs  Henry Hub  and  NY city gate  avg monthly  prices    during this 
 period?  Thanks for helping   us out on this.  Margaret
