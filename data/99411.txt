 
 That is probably our lawsuit. Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI) is an Enron LLC with Calpers-- the California State pension fund. Lets take a look.
 
 
     
 
 FYI.  I'll keep you informed of our efforts to find the suit, assuming one has been filed.

 No.  We don't have computer access to the Midland State Court, but our investigator was trying to work with the Clerk to assess captions of recently filed cases.  
  
 We went back through the Harris County filing reports, and Ben Hall did file, a couple weeks ago, a case in the 281st styled "Costilla Energy v. Joint Energy Developers"... I've instructed our investigator to get a copy of the pleading, but it didn't sound like the suit we were anticipating.  
 
 
     
 
 Did you find anything in Galveston, Midland or elsewhere indicating that there was a lawsuit filed?

 I heard that Enron's buildings are being evacuated.  In view of the chaos, I am assuming we will not be meeting this afternoon.  Call me if that's not right. 
  
 Thanks
