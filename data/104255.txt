 
 Sharon:  Thanks for your fax and markup of the Schedule dated Sept. 6.  There 
 is a major issue which we need to discuss and that is the counterparty 
 identity itself.  It appears that you have identified a DIFFERENT party to 
 the agreement, namely, a limited liability company named "SITA", which is not 
 the entity which we originally proposed,.  This does not appear to be the 
 credit which we evaluated.  
 
 Also, we insist upon a Credit Support Annex.  As you know, the agreement 
 contemplates multiple transactions and the posting of collateral is a major 
 issue, particularly for long-dated pulp deals.  
 
 Can you call me tomorrow?  We need to address the major issues upfront.  You 
 can reach me at 713-853-5620.  Thank you.  Sara
