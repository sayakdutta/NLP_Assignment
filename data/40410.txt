 Can you get a positive upside over the costs for next summer at least?  Also, 
 we think that in order to set up a load only control area, you have to have 
 firm transmission paths to generation sources (but if you  want to pursue 
 this, I need to pull the NERC rules on that issue to be certain of the 
 requirements.  We only set up generation only control areas.  Mary, the 6 or 
 so requirements are on the NERC web site.)  thanks.

 We wouldn't be a generation only control area.  Our load is Valley Electric.  
 My bigger worry is how do we meet our generation requirement if we sell off 
 LV Cogen.  Also, when the RTO forms, all control areas will be consolidated, 
 at least if their transmission is in RTO West.  
 
 
    
 Can you and Sean Crandall call me about this?  There have been a variety of 
 problems with the full use of the sink provision based on FERC's Entergy 
 order.  Also, ComEd and TVA have precluded us from sinking at the generation 
 only control area and FERC hotline has said this can be done without a FERC 
 filing (or at least we would have to pursue it in a complaint--we don't want 
 that result in a FERC order.)  In addition, while you were on vacation, 
 Nevada Power had the problem with Salt River Project.  I don't know the 
 status of that.  I am in a room reviewing etrans tariff, so page me if you 
 want to talk about it.  800-778-8365.  Thanks.
