 Attached please find the latest LV Cogen Turbine Agreement (first
 document below) that incorporates the changes received from Dale on
 April 17, as well as a blackline (second document below) showing changes
 made to the version circulated on April 10. As I mentioned in my prior
 e-mail, the April 17 comments referred to an earlier version that
 referenced Turbines no longer in this deal. As a result, I only changed
 the Guaranteed Delivery Date for Unit 24. To complete the agreement, we
 will need to insert the date of execution and Exhibit H-2.
