 Hi everyone, a good friend sent this to me today, and
 I wanted to share it with all of you.  Have a great
 semester!!
 
 Maria
 
 
  Friend
 
 
 
 When you receive this, say a prayer.  That's all you
 have to do.  There
 is
 nothing attached.  This is powerful.  Just send this
 to four people and
 do
 not break this, please.  Prayer is one of the best
 free gifts we
 receive.
 There is no cost but a lot of rewards. Let's continue
 praying for one
 another.
 
 Father, I ask you to bless my friends reading this
 right now Lord, show
 them
 
 a new revelation of Your love and power.  Holy Spirit,
 I ask You to
 minister
 
 to their spirit at this very moment.  Where there is
 pain, give them
 Your
 peace and Mercy.  Where there is self-doubting,
 release a renewed
 confidence
 
 in Your ability to work through them.  Where there is
 tiredness, or
 exhaustion, I ask You to give them understanding,
 patience, and
 strength as
 they learn submission to Your leading.  Where there is
 spiritual
 stagnation,
 
 I ask You to renew them by revealing Your nearness,
 and by drawing them
 into
 
 greater intimacy with You.  Where there is fear,
 reveal Your love, and
 release to them Your courage.  Where there is a sin
 blocking them,
 reveal
 it, and break its hold over my friend's life.  Bless
 their finances,
 give
 them greater vision, and raise up leaders, and friends
 to support, and
 encourage them.  Give each of them discernment to
 recognize the demonic
 forces around them, and reveal to them the power they
 have in You to
 defeat
 it.  I ask You to do these things in Jesus' name.
 
 In Christian love,
 Your Friend in Jesus.
 
 Passing this on to anyone you consider a friend will
 bless you both.
 Passing this on to one not considered a friend is
 something I know
 Christ
 would do.
