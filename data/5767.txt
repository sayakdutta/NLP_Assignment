 >This was a huge wedding with about 300 guests.  After the wedding,
 >at the reception, the groom got up on stage at the microphone to talk
 >to the crowd. He said that he wanted to thank everyone for coming, many
 >from long distances, to support them at their wedding. He especially wanted
 >to thank the bride's and groom's families for coming and to thank his new
 >father-in-law for providing such a fabulous
 >reception. To thank everyone for coming and bringing gifts and
 >everything, he said he wanted to give everyone a special gift from just
 >him.  So taped to the bottom of everyone's chair was a manila envelope,
 >including the wedding party.  He said that this was his gift to everyone,
 >and told everyone to open the envelopes. Inside each manila envelope was an
 >8 x 10 picture of his best man having sex with the bride.  He had gotten
 >suspicious of the two of them and hired a private detective to trail them
 >weeks prior to the wedding. After he stood there and watched the people's
 >reactions for a couple of  minutes, he turned to the best man and said
 >"F--- you", he turned to the bride and said "F--- you", and then he turned
 >to the dumb founded
 >crowd and said "I'm out of here." He had the marriage annulled first thing
 >that Monday morning. While most of us would have broken off the engagement
 >immediately after finding out about the affair, this guy goes through with
 >it anyway as if nothing was wrong. His revenge:   Making the bride's
 >parents pay over $32,000 for a 300 guest wedding and reception.  Letting
 >everyone know exactly what did happen. And best of all, trashing the
 >bride's and best man's reputations in front of all of their friends, their
 >entire families,
 >i.e. their parents, brothers, sisters, grandparents, nieces and
 >nephews, etc. Yes, revenge when applied properly, like this way, can
 >be sweet eh?
