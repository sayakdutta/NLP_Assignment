 
 Just an update, Susan Bailey, a paralegal in our group, will be working on 
 the Confirmation, her direct no. is x34737, and Stephanie Panus, another 
 paralegal in our group, will be working on the ISDA Master, her no is 
 x53249.  When you have that address and contact information ready for the 
 counterparty, why don't you email it directly to Stephanie.
 
 If I can be of further help, just let me know!
