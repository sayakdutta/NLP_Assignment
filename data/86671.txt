 
 i uderstand will take under advicement. What about a tap for the keg?
 
 
 
     
 
 I am in a meeting all day Friday...can be packed and ready to go by 5:30
 pm...keep in mind I live in Spring now!!! I was gonna go 290 through
 Austin to get to lease. Would like to consider taking two cars b/c of
 the "emergency" issue that always seems to pop up (what with sick kids
 and all)and/or break down issues, theres a back up vehicle to help
 transport in that scenario.
 
 
     
 keg sounds good, did not realize the keg frig, departure all in one(car)
 if possible,where would we meet? For opening weekend i would recommend
 and extra tap in case keg frig unit doesnt work prperly
 
 
     
 
 Keep us posted...I will be leaving about 5:30 pm fri....traffic will be
 as bad as it could be!!! Definitely staying until Monday, however!!!
 
 
     
 Joe and Brian: my favorite case may require that I work a full day on
 Friday 
 and leave with Brian friday afternoon. If I need to do that, I would
 greatly 
 appreciate it if Joe would agree to stop by the golf cart place to pick
 up 
 the new batteries. Please let me know if this is agreeable joe. e.
