 I would be TOTALLY thrilled if you could let the group know...now about those MPC numbers...we need to go through the inc sheets and service sheets from last year...and we have half an hour.

 Thanks for letting me know. I guess the point I need to make is that the people who need the sheet are still not getting it - namely, Brooklyn Couch and Ainsley Gaddis. This can be remedied by sending the sheet to EES Power Settlements. Would you mind if I let the group know that?
