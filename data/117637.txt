 dressed up even on casual days, but then we're pretty causal every day so 
 it's hard to tell.  I don't think he'd mind if you called to ask.  That 
 department is a little dressier than my area (they actually wear ties most of 
 the time Mon - Thurs) but I think Friday is pretty casual there - and you 
 have a pretty good excuse.  It might depend on who else (if anyone) you'll be 
 seeing.  The reason they get dressed up so much is that one of the senior 
 guys (don't know which one, but can find out if you want) on that floor is 
 always in a suit & tie.  If you're also talking to him it might make sense to 
 bring a change of clothes and use a stall after the interview.
