 I thought she was going to talk to Andy about this but never heard back.

 As per my voice mail and Mark's e-mail, Mark would prefer to eliminate 
 NetWorks from the review process.  Do you think Andy will object to 
 eliminating NetWork's from the process?  Instead, he prefers to instruct all 
 traders to flow all necessary documentation through Mark Greenberg or myself 
 to ensure consistent legal review.  I have revised the policy accordingly.
 
 Please review and let me know what you think.
 
 Leslie
