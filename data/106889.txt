 
 I'm receiving mine!!!  But I'll be in Buenos Aires next week so I'll keep my 
 fingers crossed that my computer is working (in the event any further earth 
 shattering Lehrer family announcements occur).  My mom does not know how to 
 turn the computer on but she does have an email address.  We better wait 
 until she "gets comfortable" with the concept of email before handing out her 
 address.  At this very minute, my dad is returning from a convention in 
 Atlantic City.  He called me from the airport on his CELL PHONE.  You see, it 
 took me some time to get him to carry his cell phone with him.  I'VE 
 SUCCEEDED!  Talk to you soon, Mr. Webmaster.  Sara
 
 
 
 








   
 
 I met with Gary today and he said he was not getting any of my e-mails.  I'm
 sending this to the group to verify addresses.  Please reply to confirm
 receipt.
