 
 I'll drive you to the airport tonight...IF I get to come over for a swim 
 Sunday. (Believe me, my motives are purely selfish - your pool is so much 
 "cooler" than mine.)
 
 -- By the way, even with our slight car problem I had a great time last 
 night.  You're really going to have to stop being so much fun to be around or 
 you'll never be able to successfully ditch me (although last night was a 
 valiant effort).
