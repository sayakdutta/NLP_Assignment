 
 Global counterparty is trying to locate online corporate search companies 
 that can check company names in Europe and Canada.  In the U.S. we can access 
 this information via Westmate in Westlaw.  Are either of you aware of any 
 online search company, or can you direct me to someone who may be aware of an 
 online search company, for Canada and Europe?  If there are no online search 
 companies available, is there a reasonably priced corporate search company 
 that can verify this information for us?
 
 I appreciate your help.
