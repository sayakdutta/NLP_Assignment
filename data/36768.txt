 This was sent to me by a friend who also has a  senior at CHS.  It was put
 together by Jamie Wax and Paul Taranto and is  truly profound.   Please
 take the time to view it and make sure your  sound is on, the music makes
 it.

 Be sure to visit this  sight.  It is very well done.  Some of you know
 Jamie Wax  and  others will have heard the name Taranto because Darlene,
 who taught Hank and  Mamie and will, hopefully, teach Mak in 5th grade is
 Paul's wife.  Paul and  Jamie wrote the musical "Evangeline" (based on the
 Acadian story of Evangeline).   The music is from that play.

 I have seen several tributes -- but this one is really special.  New photos
 of the WTC
 disaster - such an unbelievable nightmare.  Take a few minutes to watch
 this.  It's worth it.

 A  guy in Baton Rouge -- Mason Wood -- put together this incredible
 montage of the images from 9/11/01 that is incredibly poignant and well
 presented.  You've got to see it to appreciate it.  It is set to music
 written by Jamie Wax and Paul Taranto from the musical "Evangeline".
 They didn't realize what a profoundly appropriate backdrop it
 would make to express a country's sentiments.  Put it on and turn it
 up!  Then send this on.  I did.
