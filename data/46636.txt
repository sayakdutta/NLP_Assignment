 
 Frank,
 
 Mark asked me to handle this.  Can you forward to me the name and phone 
 number of the person that signed the password application?  Thanks.

 Mark,
 
 The City Of Riverside has mailed in a password application form to trade on 
 EnronOnline (EOL).  This customer is considered a "muni" and we need to know 
 if there are any legal restrictions (by product type) that would keep them 
 from trading on EOL.  We would like to respond back to this customer as soon 
 as we receive approval/rejection back from our legal, credit, and tax 
 departments.
 
 Please contact me with any questions.
 
 Thanks for your help!
 
 Frank
