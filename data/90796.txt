 Yes that time has come upon us again - fantasy football for the 2001 season.
 I'm sure I echo everyone's feelings about the loss of Rick Pearce.  It's
 been a tough summer because of it.  Since Rick took care of much of the
 Commissioner's duties the past few years, we are in a void.  That being
 said, I want to start this process of keeping our league intact.  Please
 respond as quickly as possible and let me know your intentions as far as
 
 (1) playing in the league
 (2) preference for a draft date (September 1 which is Labor Day Weekend, or
 September 9)
 (3) anyone you know who might be interested in joining the league.
 
 
 
 Thanks
