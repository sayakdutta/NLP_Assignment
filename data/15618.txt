 
 Per our conversation, here's a copy of the curves that need updating.  If 
 possible, could you get them to me by tomorrow afternoon?  Sorry for the 
 rush.  Gotta talk on Thursday.  I want to superimpose on the curves the 
 rates  that Loretta just put in place for 500 KW and above (for Edison and 
 PG&E).  Can you do that if I get you the rates?  Thanks a million.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
