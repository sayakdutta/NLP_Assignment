 that from all reports had a minimum of glitches.  Can we use the same 
 technology?

 I have attached a success report of the streaming communications vehicles we 
 used for the All Employee meeting on Feb. 21, 2001.  The report includes 
 information about the following:
 
 Video Teleconference
 Audio and Video quality; Viewing employees
 
 IP-TV
 Statistics; Successes of the locations streamed
 
 Video Requests
 Quantity by location and group
 
 
 To improve access and increase the employee's viewing experience at future 
 meetings,  we are working with the IP-TV technical team to find solutions to 
 the problems that occurred in February.  From the employee feedback we 
 received, we will plan to send slides in advance to the video teleconference 
 locations.
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this report.
 
 Thanks,
 Courtney
