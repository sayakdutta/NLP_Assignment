 David,
 
 As far as I can tell, Mike McCall is not under a current employment 
 agreement.  I sent you a draft agreement for him on December 2, 1999, and 
 have heard nothing more about the status of that agreement.
 
 I do not have any other information about the terms of his employment 
 (salary, options, etc.).
 
 Let me know if you would like any other information from me.
 
 Michelle

 What are his current employment terms?
 
 If we were to let him go what would be your advice on deal?
 
 David
