 
 Dan,  Attached are clean and redlined version of the purchase and gathering 
 agreement.  There is no language in these agreement about a right to match 
 outside of the Reserve Committment Area.  I haven't had a chance to bounce a 
 separate agreement off of Shonnie yet, but will let you know.  Call me if you 
 have any questions.
