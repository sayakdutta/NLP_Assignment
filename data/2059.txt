 
 On Friday, will there be a private reception or area for us or will our 
 customers get lost in the crowd?
 Probably thinking 30 invites for Friday.  Is that ok?
 
 
     
 Hey Buster,
 
 Hope you had a great time in Cabo! I'm so jealous.  I need a vacation 
 desperately!  
 
 I'm trying to get a commitment on numbers from the different groups for the 
 Guggenheim events.  Will you look over this document and tell me which ones 
 you would like to attend and how many people you would like to bring to each? 
 Of course, I need it ASAP -- what's new, right?!!
 
 Thanks honey! Margaret
