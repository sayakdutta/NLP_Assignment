 
 Hello Sarah:
 My name is Jeff Dasovich.  I work for Enron in Enron's San Francisco office.  
 Last Friday, the Chairman of our company, Ken Lay, met with Kevin Sharer and 
 other CEOs from California to discuss the energy crisis in California and the 
 need to develop as soon as possible a comprehensive solution to the problem.  
 Mr. Sharer asked for some additional background on the issues and the 
 solution and asked that you be contact person.  That information is attached. 
 If you have any  questions, don't hesitate to contact me at 415.782.7822 or 
 on my pager at 888.916.7184.
 
 Best regards,
 Jeff Dasovich
