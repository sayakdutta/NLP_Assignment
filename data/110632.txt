 Here are the headers:
 
 1.  PIPELINE_ID
 2.  EFFECTIVE_DTM
 3.  DATA_REFERENCE_NUM
 4.  FLOW_TYPE_CD
 5.  MAXIMUM_CAPACITY_QTY
 6.  UTILIZED_CAPACITY_QTY
 7.  AVAILABLE_CAPACITY_QTY
 8.  PIPELINE_CYCLE_ID
 
 These are the column headings needed for the historical data Excel files 
 (they do not have to be in any particular order, but initially a template 
 should be created, and then used throughout).  This format makes it a simple 
 process to load this information into the database.
 
 Thanks for all of your hard work!!
 
 Chris
