 
 To prepare an NDA for you I will need the following information:
 
 1.  The correct legal name of the counterparty
 2.  Whether the agreement is bilateral (both parties providing confidential 
 information) or one-way (where only Enron is providing confidential 
 information).  Our preference is to use the Enron protected party form since 
 it is written more in our favor.
 3.  The nature and/or use of the information being provided.
 4.  The address of the counterparty
 5.  The phone and fax number of the counterparty
 
 Once I have all this I can prepare your NDA in short order.
