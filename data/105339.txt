 
 Below is a document containing "General Terms and Conditions" which is ALWAYS 
 attached to a financial confirmation when the parties have no executed master 
 agreement.  If Ed, Tracy or someone in credit needs to add credit to the 
 transaction, then we ALSO attach an Annex B (counterparty specific credit 
 provisions),  Annex B-1(collateral and exposure provisions) and a letter of 
 credit format. 
 
 I am only attaching the General Terms and Conditions.
 
 
 
 Let me know if you still want to see the ISDA Master Agreement (preprinted 
 boilerplate consisting of an agreement and Credit Support Annex which I 
 cannot email) together with a sample Schedule and Paragraph 13 to the Credit 
 Support Annex (which are the two "customized" pieces negotiated by legal) .
 
 Thanks.  Sara
