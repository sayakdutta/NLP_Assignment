 
 who is handling reinstatement for ENA?
 
  
     
 Lizzette, 
 If we have to reinstate or hire new employees in the near future, will we have a sample re-instatement or sample offer letter available?   I don't need one now but I anticipate possibly needing one in the future.

 Hector, this may be coming - We need to get approval from Net Works OTC and then Oxley, but just fyi.  I will forward emails to you as I receive them.
