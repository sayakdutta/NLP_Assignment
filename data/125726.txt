 i just talked to mom again.  she was super crusty (and even swore!).  i
 asked what was wrong, and she said that it's partially about dad, and
 partially about the house.  she said dad isn't doing anything around the
 house (vacuum, mop) and then she wants to do it, but gets tired.  i told
 her i'd get her a maid, and she said no, but i think we should anyway.
 what do you think?
