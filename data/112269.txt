 
 FYI.  These bills are currently moving through the California Legislature.  Not sure if the bills will be signed into law.
 
 Please call with any questions.  From my quick glance, only good news is that it appears that the Windfall Profits Tax would not apply to retail contracts in effect on date of enactment.

 Attached, please find links to the amended versions of ABX2 2 (windfall
 profits tax) and ABX2 65 (market manipulation).  The new version of SBX2 78
 (MOU) should be available early tomorrow, however the amendments I faxed out
 yesterday represent the only changes to the bill.
