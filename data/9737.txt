 didn't proof the content very well.  Thanks for looking out for me!  --Sally 
 
 
 
 

    
 
 Sally,
  I added league hours to your hours report for you as you attended all
 patroness meetings (Oct and Nov) and the Holiday Tea.  I added 5 hours for
 those meetings for a total 12 for this qtr. If it should be more, let me
 know.  I wasn't there in Oct.  That makes your year to date league 33.5.
 Thanks for  all your hard work with the girls.
 Hours/Awards,
 Sarah Marshall
