 
 I was talking to one of my customers yesterday, and they said that Southern California Gas Co. recently made a filing to revive unbundling of their system.  Can you tell me if that is true .  Also can you tell me what the status is regarding Socal Gas purchasing natural gas for the  needs of SDGE's customers.  My customers tell me that is probably going to happen as well.

 FYI.  This should be interesting.

 Today, October 9, 2001, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) filed an
 application with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).
 
 In this application, PG&E proposes a market structure and rules for the
 northern California natural gas industry, beginning 
 January 1, 2003.  PG&E's filing was in response to a recent Commission order
 (Decision 01-09-016), which directed PG&E to file a "Gas Accord II"
 application.
 
 If you have any problems opening these documents, please contact me at (415)
