 
 did you finally talk to him today?
 
 i'm definitely interested in the movie/dinner (i have a couple things in mind) but it probably won't be till around 8 o'clock or so...if that's ok with you.
 
  
     
 i just think hes precious.
 
 anyway, i still have a movie to watch tonight if you are interested in us trying to whip up something for dinner and plop in front of the tv?
