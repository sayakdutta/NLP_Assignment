 letter which should update you on the way I am playing it.

 Rob- Here are a few comments
 Global change: Eletrabras should be Eletrobras
 I sent you seperately the GSA strategy paper. I think your captured the main 
 objectives> We probably do not want to highlite the VAT objective.I have 
 asked fedi to summarise the vintage deal  and answer your other questions on 
 Bolivian producers but it is also sumarised in the GSA  paper I just sent you
 Are we going to drop the ownership request for now?

 input from Rick concerning the Vintage deal.
