 
 Can we get together and review the outstanding issues?  How about this 
 afternoon or tomorrow morning?  Sara

 Ms. Shackleton:
 
 I did receive your note the other day, as well as a more recent phone call
 from Mr. Brant Reeves.  I apologize for not getting back to you sooner.
 
 As I explained to Ms. Heard a while back, I had placed this in the "going
 nowhere" file, given all the work we had put in over here which had
 apparently been rejected wholesale by Enron.  If you recall, we had sent
 over our so-called "base form" to which Enron responded with a vast array of
 comments.  Many of those were incorporated in a redraft, but that effort
 went nowhere.
 
 I'll be glad to exhume this file and see where we are, and what our
 prospects are for making progress vis-.-vis the others we are working on
 over here.
 
 Mike
