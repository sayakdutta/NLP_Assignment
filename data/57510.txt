 context adequately to Ken.

 You seemed troubled by the call to Barton.  This bill may or may not be 
 subsumed by the comprehensive energy bill that Congress undertakes this 
 summer.  Both bills have a very difficult, if not nearly impossible, path 
 ahead given that the Democrats are in no mood for compromise.  The call to 
 Barton was to:  a) repair relationships (and with the Wall Street Journal 
 calling Barton about his troubled past with Enron, repair is needed); b) 
 proclaim victory, even of a limited nature (something I think Enron has not 
 done much of); c) build a further bond with Barton so we would have more 
 input at full Committee (something we will need given the chances that this 
 will go off the track are real); and d) allow Enron to get significant credit 
 for the defeat of price caps.  I hear from lots of DC sources that we have 
 not had any success in the House Energy and Commerce Committee.  Numerous 
 folks at the markup noted in private conversations that this was Enron's 
 first real role in the Committee.  Thus, even though this is a very limited 
 bill, the call made sense.  I do not think that this means we should call the 
 White House to push the bill with them.  The bill itself still has lots of 
 obstacles and many potential threats ahead.
