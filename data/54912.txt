 Vince --
 
 Please feel free to also call Jeff Dasovich (415-782-7822) in our San 
 Fransisco office.  He has been very involved in the California market 
 discussions and presented before FERC during their field hearings.  He knows 
 the profs you are meeting with and has some great insights into our positions.
 
 Jeff also attended Berkeley as an undergrad and is now attending their 
 B-school in the evenings.
 
 Thanks.
 
 Jim Steffes

 Steve,
 
 I am a lead recruiter at the University of California at Berkeley for
 Enron Analyst/Associate program.
 
 I contacted several friends who work at Berkeley and received an invitation
 from one of them to make a presentation at the weekly Faculty Seminar
 of the Dept. of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research.
 
 The students and faculty members from the business school will be also 
 invited.
 
 Berkeley in general, and Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations 
 Research in
 particular, are important centers of academic research on electricity markets
 (S. Oren works very closely with Severin Borenstein).
 
 My presentation will focus on the Analyst/Associate program. I shall  also 
 have
 an opportunity to discuss the power markets in California (I expect many
 questions) before many experts who are very  important to shaping
 public opinion and regulatory agenda.
 
 Please, let me know who in you group could help me in preparing this 
 presentation
 and in presenting  Enron's point of view in a more effective way.
 
 
 Vince
