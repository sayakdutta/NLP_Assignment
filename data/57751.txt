  Steve, for the last two years I have been working for Shelley and my 
 responsibilities include working with the ETS  and NBPL to determine our 
 positions as it relates to the standardization process at GISB.  In the last 
 budget process, it was decided to reduce our level of support at GISB and my 
 position will be eliminated March 31.  I have been working with Cindy and her 
 Redeployment Team to look at other opportunities within Enron but to date, I 
 have not received an offer.  I would be interested in talking to someone in 
 your organization about any opportunities within Government Affairs.  If 
 there are any opportunities in your areas, could you direct me to the 
 appropriate person?  
 
     Thanks!
