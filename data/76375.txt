 
 I know a couple of their lawyers from a prior transaction (Doug Turner and 
 their GC, whose name I've now forgotten).  Don't know who they will have on 
 this one.
 
 I'm off to the Astros, but would like to visit with you tomorrow, if you will 
 be around.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay

 I'm looking forward to working with you on this.  I wonder who opposing
 inhouse counsel is at TECO?
