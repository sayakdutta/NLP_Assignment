 Looks like we sent them a draft EEI Cover Sheet earlier this year.  
 
 Genia, Can you e-mail that draft to Wendy?

 Carol,
 
 I think we would like to push for an EEI with Morgan.  I will send up a 
 credit worksheet ASAP.

 Carol,
 
 I read the assignment and reviewed our positions with Morgan and Merchant 
 Energy Group of America ("MEGA").  Credit is fine with the assignment.  
 However, as a result of 
 MEGA assigning its trades to Morgan, our mark-to-market exposure to Morgan 
 increases by approximately $27.8mm over the next 18 months.  Although we have 
 agreed to post margin to each other in the past, our current Master Energy 
 Purchase and Sale Agreement with Morgan does not have any STATED provisions 
 for margining.  Consequently, we would like to amend the agreement to include 
 collateral thresholds for both Enron and Morgan.  I will discuss this issue 
 with Ed and get back to you.
 
 Thanks,
 Wendy

 Wendy:
 Have you had a chance to take a look at this and if so, do you have any 
 credit issues with this assignment?
