 
 Thanks.  We amended the guaranty yesterday to do just that.  We are trying to 
 have the guaranty executed.
 
 Stephanie:  We will ultimately need to attach the "Clement approved" form of 
 guaranty to the Confirmation.  Also, we may as well note the new guaranty in 
 the amendment to the first transaction.

 Looks good to me.  We will need to amend our outgoing gty by increasing the 
 amount from $10MM to $20MM and also expand gty coverage to cover all agmts 
 which are financially settled w/ ENA.

 Ed,
 
 Please review the attached revised confirm for Con Ed.  The revision is to 
 the Exposure Threshold/Credit Ratings on page 1 of Annex B-1.  As ENA does 
 not have a credit rating above BBB+, we have inserted $20 mil. (the BBB+ 
 threshold) for those ratings above BBB+.
 
 Please contact either Sara or myself.
 
 Thanks,
 Stephanie

 Sara - I spoke to Clement about the revised guaranty and have emailed him 
 clean and blacklined copies.
