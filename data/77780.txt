 I believe Chris should be back today, so I wanted to follow up on this.  
 
 I don't have any recollection of where we left the escrow agreement with NW.  
 Please get with MKahn or Jerry DeBerry to see if we can get consensus on the 
 current form of escrow agreement.  Once we have that, Enron (Chris) will make 
 contact with Citibank.  
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
