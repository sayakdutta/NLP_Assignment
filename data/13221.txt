 Michelle,
 
 I was given your name as a contact to discuss the HR/Labor issues for 
 creating a JV.  We are evaluating a JV for our Merchant Generation, and need 
 to talk through a number of issues with you.  I am available any time 
 tomorrow.  Please let me know your availability.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Don
