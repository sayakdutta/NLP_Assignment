  re ratepayers committee
 
 
  
 Howard Weg has asked that I poll the committee members because several 
 members of the committee have advised that they believe we should take a 
 position supporting PG&E's motion to vacate the UST's appointment of a 
 Ratepayers' committee in the PG&E bankruptcy case.  The idea is to file a 
 brief joinder stating that the Participants' Committee in the CalPX case, 
 representing constituents which are the real parties in interest of over $1.9 
 billion in claims against PG&E, as scheduled by PG&E in
 its list of 20 largest creditors, supports the motion and the joinder filed 
 by the PG&E creditors' committee.  Our joinder would state that there is no 
 statutory basis for appointing a ratepayers' committee and that it is not in 
 the best interest of the estate.  We might also indicate that we agree with 
 PGE and the PGE creditors' committee that there are other means for 
 ratepayers to be heard which make more sense than giving them official 
 committee status.  We would also appear telephonically
 at the hearing, this Friday, at 10 a.m.
 
 Please let me know as soon as possible if you would like a conference call on 
 this issue.  Also, please let me know as soon as possible if you object to 
 the committee taking this position.
 
 Thank you.
