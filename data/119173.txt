 We have recently completed our Gas Trading Audit.  From our audit, we
 identified an item to be addressed pertaining to legal's involvement in the
 confimation process.  Throughout our audit, we were in contact with Jeff
 Hodge; however, since our action item pertains to both physical and
 financial deals, I wanted to forward this item to you for your review.
 (Item D in the high priority section)

 Upon review, please let me know if you have any questions and/or comments.
 
 Thank you,
 
 Sharon
