 Jackie/Gerald
 We have done a term deal with Entex Gas Marketing starting August 1, 1999. 
 The term is for one year and will end July 31, 2000. This is a point specific 
 deal. The delivery point is meter 8078/ Rhone Poulen Chemical Plant (Rhodia). 
 The receipt points will be meter 4132/ Exxon Katy Plant Tail Gate, meter 
 6780/ Oasis Katy, meter 0067/ Lone Star Katy, meter 0072/ Western Katy. The 
 out rate at meter 8078 is $.075. The in rate at meters 4132, 6780, 0067, & 
 0072, is $.03. This deal was done for full plant requirements up to 1,750 
 MMBtus/day. We have a Intrastate Master receipt/delivery contract already set 
 up with Entex Gas Marketing (012-27106-02-001). I would like for us to do a 
 confirmation for this deal under this contract, and assign it a different 
 number for scheduling to schedule on. Please let me know what this number 
 will be so I can make all parties aware.
 
 
 Kent,
 If you see anything above that does not look right to you please give me a 
 call.  
 
 
 
 Thanks,
 Michael
