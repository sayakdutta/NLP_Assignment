 Cheryl Nelson is handling this and she will be back in the office on Monday.  
 By copy of this message, I ask that she contact you.  I believe that this is 
 nearing completion.

 Have you been talking with ITG Posit regarding installing their software in 
 London?

 Julie/Laurel,
 
 I am back in London to continue our effort to get equity trading going over 
 here.  Being back in the States the past two months, however, I have not been 
 pushing the install of these apps.  I think we are OK on Autex and Instinet 
 (although there may be issues with their Win2K compliancy) but do not know 
 the status on ITG/Posit.  Although there may well have been further 
 correspondence subsequent to the e-mails below, this is the most recent I can 
 find.  Do either of you either know of any further developments and/or have 
 the install/contractual package I mentioned?  
 
 Thanks and regards,
 John

 Julie,
 
 Do you have any recollection of receiving any software for this install?  
 Laurel does not have anything on it.  Please let me know as soon as possible 
 because if we don't have it we will have to get in touch with the vendor to 
 get it going.
 
 Thanks and regards,
 John

 Julie/Laurel,
 
 After the flurry of e-mails below, I received a package from ITG/Posit Europe 
 which I subsequently sent to one of you in Houston.  I am not sure who I sent 
 it to but I am quite sure it got there and was "put through the channels" 
 because Sara Shackleton has been working with ITG on the contractual issues.  
 I am now trying to find out if any software was included in that package 
 because I would like to get the install process going pending the 
 finalization of the contract negotiations.  Please confirm as to whether or 
 not either of you are aware of this installation software.
 
 Thanks and regards,
 John

 John,
 The contracts for the AutEx system have arrived and are being processed.
 Do you still require the Instinet and ITG systems I vaguely remember some 
 contracts being sent through do you know the status ?
 Thanks

 Cyrus/Julie,
 
 Can you please coordinate with Jamie White at ITG on this install.  I don't 
 really care how I get it.  I would presume that someone in our IT group 
 worked with ITG to determine the best delivery method on the original 
 install.  If so, please use the same architecture.  If not, please consider 
 the options and if we think there exists a better method than the one being 
 in Houston, let's upgrade the one in Houston concurrently with the London 
 install so the two sites are in synch.
 
 This install will initially be for European equity trading only but we may 
 want to incorporate US equities at a later date as well.  Any activity on 
 this setup will be governed by the same agreements currently in place as it 
 will be done on behalf of both ECT Investments and Enron North America until 
 further notice.
 
 Thanks and regards,
 John

 Is this for European or US equities or both ?
 Do you want to trade using Internet access or would you prefer a fixed link 
 leased line ?
 If you could let me know
 Thanks

 Cyrus,
 
 Can you please arrange for this installation on my desktop.  Please 
 coordinate with Julie Pechersky and Jamie White to ensure that my setup has 
 the same functionality as Selena Gonzales in Houston.
 
 Thanks and regards,
 John
