 Steve and Richard:
 This looks ok to me if you set a deadline for lifting.  Richard, are you in 
 agreement?

 While we have offered you additional time to perform under the said contract 
 you still have not responded.  In the event that Helm US Chemical Corp. 
 decides not to lift the contracted 1,000 m/tons Styrene Monomer Enron will be 
 forced to take legal action for failure to fulfill the obligation set fourth 
 by the contract.
