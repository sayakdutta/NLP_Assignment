 Hi Vince,
 
 How are you.  It was really a pleasure meeting you and talking to you at
 the Toronto energy derivative conference.  Thank you for speaking with
 me about the possibility of visiting your research group.  It will be
 great if I could have such opportunity whenever you see your schedule
 fits.  I am very much open for the last week of July and early August.
 I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon.
 
 Best,
 
 Shijie
