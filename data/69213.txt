 
 I am meeting monthly with each person in my group to go over their training 
 plans and get feedback on things they would like assistance with.  I need to 
 still meet with Souad for this month and need to get with Anna and go over 
 the information that I have given her.  One thing that seems to have come up 
 several times is the desire to continue the brown bag sessions.  Some topics 
 that have come up are OA and  curve mapping.  I have talked with Kam about 
 this and we are going to try and put something together.
