 Judy,
 
 I am in process of finalizing the basic GISB Contract to prepare it for
 execution....
 However, I need to get a response back from you regarding OUR Special
 Provisions I sent you....Most likely, we will have to COMBINE both of the
 YOURS & OUR Special Provisions into one document....At that time, I will
 forward it to our Legal Dept. for final review as they have to approve it...
 
 I will await your response...Thanks!
