 
 We are finalizing the master netting agreement among BNP Paribas and Enron Corp., et al for execution, and have received copies of all underlying documentation with the exception of documentation for Enron Metals Limited.  Can you fax or e-mail me a copy of what documentation Enron Metals Limited signs--ISDA, general terms and conditions, etc. with BNP Paribas?   We need to receive this documentation ASAP.
 
 Thanks for your help.
