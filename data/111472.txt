 Carol, from the way this sounds, your four weeks goes on into the 26 weeks as 
 long as your doctor hasn't released you.  What do you think.  Man, this stuff 
 is hard to decifer!

 Under doctors care, the employee is paid 4 wks at 100% of their base, granted 
 that no sick time has been taken prior to the maternity leave.  If the doctor 
 requires her to be off work before her due date, this time would be coded as 
 sick.  Even after delivery and still under doctors care you would code her 
 sick time.  until the doctor releases her to return to work.  Once she has 
 been released by the doctor Carol has the option to take time off using any 
 vacation available or could take FMLA leave (if  she qualifies )  with 
 supervisor approval.

 Carmen, I understand that Carol will get her 4 weeks sick pay for having the 
 baby and then whatever vacation she wants to take, but what does the doctor 
 need to do to extend her into the 26 weeks of 90% pay.  She's already 
 starting to have problems, so I'm sure she's not going to be able to return 
 to work after 4 weeks.  I need details on how to address this issue.  Thanks, 
 Suzanne
