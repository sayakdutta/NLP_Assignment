 Hi Vince, I have a quick question for you.  The EOL folks want to put a 
 couple of articles from the Risk book (Managing Energy Price Risk) on the 
 internet.  I told them that  would be a copywrite violation.  Is there 
 someone at Risk they could call to get permission for this, or is it even 
 worth calling?  Thanks
 
 Ross
