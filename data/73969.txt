 Kay,
 As things continue to move ahead on the other doc's (with Greg), I would like 
 to priority to go to getting the first draft of the transfer price agreement 
 as soon as possible.  Per your note below, I think Monday could be feasible 
 with the expectation to get a draft to Peoples before the end of next week.  
 In addition, the below agreement will no doubt be edited in the next week.
 
 Thanx,
 
 Laura
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
    
 Laura,
 
 Here's the revised version:
 
 
 
 Here's a compared version so you will know what I did:
 
 
 
 I'll work on the transfer price agreement today or this weekend so we will 
 have something to discuss.  
 
 I'm planning on being in Chicago on Thursday if you would like to discuss any 
 of these matters.
 
 Kay
