 it.

 Jeff,
 As you suggested last week, I am letting you know that I have yet to hear
 from Jeff about setting something up.  I did manage to speak with Michelle
 about what she is doing and I was exited about what she had to say.  let me
 know how proactive I should be about getting in touch with Jeff.  Hope you
 are well.
