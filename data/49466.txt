 Dear All,
 
 On 25th October I announced my resignation from Enron Europe to pursue other 
 opportunities.  I just wanted to say that the past 3 1/2 years has been a 
 very interesting and positive experience for me, having been a key part of 
 such a dynamic and fast-moving organisation.  Enron is by far the best 
 organisation I have ever worked for, and I am proud to have had the 
 opportunity to work here and become a shareholder.  I have found it a real 
 pleasure to have worked with such talented and interesting individuals as 
 exist within Enron Europe and Enron Corp in Houston & Portland and I 
 genuinely wish you the best of success going forward.  I would also like to 
 take this opportunity to thank Vince Kaminski, John Sherriff and Richard 
 Lewis for hiring me in April 97 and thereafter offering such interesting and 
 challenging projects to work on.
 
 I have made some excellent friends at Enron and hope to keep them - I have a 
 base in London and will probably be visiting Houston soon, so please feel 
 free to stay in touch!

 Best wishes for the future!
