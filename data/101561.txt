 JD,
 
 To follow up on our earlier meeting, attached are the following documents for CG&E:
 
 	- TSA network handbook which summarizes all requirements
 	- Request for Network Transmission Service (Network Application)
 	- Request to designate a New Network Resource (only required when we are ready to designate a resource)
 	- OATT Tariff Attachments that includes Attachment F, Network Service Agreement and Attachment G, Network Operating Agreement
 	- CG&E TSA, Transmission Scheduling Agent Agreement
 
 If EPMI does not already have the Network Transmission Agreements in place, then CG&E indicated that the process was to first fill out the Network Application and then they will send the Network Service Agreement and the Network Operating Agreement.  
 
 My contacts at CG&E have been Paul Jett  (513) 287-1770 and Steve Averbeck (513) 287-2876.  The government affairs contact is Gloria Ogenyi x 58202.  
 
 Thanks, 
 Jeff
