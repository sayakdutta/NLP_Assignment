 HI Marie
 
 I've received an executed ISDA back from Research Machines -- regarding all of the compliance items listed in the Schedule -- that we need to deliver -- do you have a contact person in tax, etc. where you get the documents?  For example, "duly executed tax forms, documents or certificates referenced " -- this is one of the items we need to deliver to counterparty.  Could you let me know how to handle this please?
 
 I could work with Carol St. Clair on this if you prefer.
 
 Thanks Marie.
 
 Tracy
