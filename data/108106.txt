 
 I did receive an envelope from you last evening.  No problem to postpone our 
 meeting.  However, when should I pick up the car?  
 
 Best,

 Jeff,
 A)   I hope you received the courier delivered envelope re:the Range Rover 
 detail.
 B)   Would you think me rude if I were respectfully to ask to postpone our 
 meet tomorrow -
    I do fully recognize the many requests for your time and trust this will 
 not preclude me    chatting with you again shortly.
