 Hi Team,
 
 I did not get much time to work on the case today - got 
 pulled into a few meetings, and only just got back form 
 class. BUT, tomorrow looks good... 
 
 Jeff, Mark: can you send across what you have? Should 
 we shoot for a conf call around 12:00? 
 
 For Class 5 (i.e. second half tomorrow), didn't Sarah say 
 she was going to send across a pdf file on email, or put 
 something on Izio web site ? Did anyone receive this file?

 Ok, Great.
 
 I'm in class tonight, but will be working on the case today 
 around lunch. Sounds like tomorrow AM may be a better 
 time for a conf call - after everyone sends around their 
 analysis to each other. I'll take a crack at putting it all 
 together - as I am relatively free tomorrow.

 Greetings:
 
 I'm in the group (and traveling on the East Coast, returning late tonite).
 I can do a conference all today if folks would like.  Otherwise, I'll be
 working on it on the plane back tonite and will distribute when I get home
 or first thing in the AM.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Hey Guys,
 
 Just sat down to read about the first write up that is due
 this Thursday, and realized that this is supposed to be a
 group assignment!!  Ooops - I had no idea... Did you ;-)
 Anyone read the case and/or taken a crack at it? Should
 we try and co-ordinate a conference call?
 
 Carolyn is out for the week and excused from the
 assignment - just had a baby girl last Fri!!
 Jeff, did you hear from teacher if OK to join ?
