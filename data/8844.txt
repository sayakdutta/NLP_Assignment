 
 I am open from 3:00 to 4:00 on Thursday - have to meet with Enron's legal 
 counsel from Sydney at 4:00, followed by a 4:30 meeting with Delainey on a 
 proposed asset sale.   I have rescheduled my meeting with the Sydney guy  
 several times this week, and I think this may be my last shot of meeting with 
 him during this trip.  Is an hour sufficient?  --Sally

 Tomorrow at 3:00 works for the demo guys.  Is it still OK on your calendar?
