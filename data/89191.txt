 I started to review the above-referenced GISB sent by you to Jeff Spector on
 April 5, 2001, and realized that we already have a GISB in place between
 NSP-MN and Enron Capital & Trade Resources.  Is it necessary to prepare
 another GISB with the Enron North America entity, or can there be an
 assignment of the Enron Capital & Trade Resources Agmt.  Please advise.
 
 In addition, I called you earlier this week and left a message concerning
 the Transaction confirmations you recently prepared for Public Service
 Company of Colorado and Cheyenne Light Fuel and Power, which utilized the
 Enfolio General Terms and Conditions as the Base Agreement.  Our preference
 would be to instead structure these Transactions under GISB Agreements with
 each of these utilities.  Please advise if this is acceptable and, if so, I
 will prepare GISB Agreements, along with our Special Provisions page, and
 send them to you for review.
 
 I look forward to your reply.
