 through that class?  Everything went fine this morning.  I just had to 
 rebuild the bench and the basis report but that's all!!  Lavo seemed happy 
 with everything this morning.  No screaming anyway.   And no I didn't get 
 much sleep last night, but it wasn't really your fault.  Even after I went to 
 bed I just kept waking up.  It was one of those nights where you wake up and 
 look at the clock at least once every hour.  I feel a little dazed but other 
 than that I'm okay.
 
 And no I'm not glad to be back at work.  Are you?
 
 Talk to ya later,
 Robin

 Hi!
 How is it possible that my Financial Statement Analysis book was more helpful 
 than your Tax book as far as how to handle NOL accounts?
 It was not even worth carrying that heavy book. Just kidding, thank you very 
 much anyways.  Was everything ok this morning?
 
 I felt bad I left really late last night. I hope you got some good rest. 
 Glad you are back at work?
