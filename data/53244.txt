 Vince:  Bjorn must be in Chicago Wednesday so  we must move the meeting to Tuesday or Thursday, if that is possible.   Otherwise, give me other possibilities.  Thanks, Al

   Vince:  That works for us at the Hyatt Regency  at 7am.  The earlier the better on the Plan.  See you soon.   Al

     Al, 
 What about  meeting Stinson on Wednesday next week (after Thanksgiving) at 7:00 a.m.,  Hyatt Regency? We should be able to E-mail you the business plan outline the  day before. 
 Have a Happy Thanksgiving.
