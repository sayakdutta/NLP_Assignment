 Lynn, 
 I was aware of this.  Courtney and I have been working on this.  I will be in the office in the morning (Monday) and will make sure we get it back to her.

 Tuesday is fine, we would like to try and get this issue resolved by the end of the month.
 Thanks, 
 Courtney

 		Courtney, Randy Janzen is out of the office until Tuesday.  Can we have him do this
 		on Tuesday or do I need to have someone else run the spreadsheet?  Thanks. Lynn

 		In our effort to decide if we need to re-negotiate contract 101021 and 101073 with Duke to possibly eliminate the BTU Daily Gas Wire numbers and instead use the Gas Daily numbers, I have attached a spreadsheet that gives the Gas Daily and BTU Daily Gas Wire numbers for Mid 13 and Demarc.  Randy, could you please run the Gas Daily numbers in your calculation for the last 13 months?  We would like to see the bottom line impact between using the BTU Daily Gas Wire publication vs. the Gas Daily publication.  We are hoping this will give some insight on whether it would be beneficial to us to re-negotiate the 2 contracts. 
 		Thanks,
 		Courtney Barker
