 
 Dear Mr. Kester,  
 
 We are in receipt of your letter dated January 26, 2001, regarding a 
 sponsorship opportunity at Energy West's Summer Energy Conference.  Upon 
 review, we have decided to decline participation.
 
 We thank you for extending the invitation to Enron and send best wishes for a 
 successful conference.
 
 Regards,
