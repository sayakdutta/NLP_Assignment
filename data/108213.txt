 Mike wanted to go over the DASH process with me before anything gets sent 
 out.  I am meeting with him tomorrow and will distribute it tomorrow or 
 Monday.
 
 
 
    
 This is helpful.  Can you also distribute the DASH system, why we use it, how 
 to use it, and approvals needed for deals?  Thanks.   Jeff

 Attached for your review are the fundamental operating standards and controls 
 that have been developed by the Wholesale Services group.  These standards 
 are to be met by all Enron offices and by each functional group within the 
 operations process.  Qualitative standards should be viewed as the basic 
 measures to be taken when opening a new office or trading a new commodity.  
 Statistics measuring compliance with quantitative standards will be monitored 
 on a daily basis and any issues that arise will be addressed immediately.
 
 As business unit heads, you play a critical role in working with Operations 
 to ensure that proper controls are in place and working effectively.  Please 
 review this document and let me know if you have any questions or wish to 
 discuss further.
 
 Regards,
 
 Brent
