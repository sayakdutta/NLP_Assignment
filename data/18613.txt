 Given that we are already well into the Summer of '01, it now appears that 
 further CDWR contracting will only lock CA into high prices.  The original 
 idea was that CDWR could buy power at $80/mwh and ensure that retail rates 
 wouldn't go higher.  Neither of these concepts have held true.
 
 I think that Enron needs to consider actively oppossing any further 
 contracting and a bond issuance in light of the potential harm that CDWR will 
 do.  First, the prices they are getting won't be great for customers.  
 Second, with the "new" stranded costs that will be created, direct access in 
 the future won't have a chance.
 
 Appreciate everyone's thoughts?
