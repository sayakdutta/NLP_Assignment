 Hello Steve,
 
 I left Mike Hicks a voicemail message yesterday.  
 
 TAP (US & Canada), Navigant (Nepco, Seattle) Vitol (Domestic), Ayscough (London), Imperial Tour (PGE, Portland) and Travel Management Consultants (EES, Chicago) confirmed that we did not have any employees booked on flight 587.  
 
 Eight (8) employees were identified with reservations to leave New York yesterday.  They were all contacted and ultimately able to proceed with travel plans.
 
 Please don't hesitate to phone me directly if you have any questions.
