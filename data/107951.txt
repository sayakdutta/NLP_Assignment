 
 Great.  Thanks for the update.  What about signing some of the big locals up 
 to EOL?

 We had one of our most successful days on Enron Online today.  In addition to 
 the frontline NYMEX look-a-like trades, we did six jet swaps and two heat 
 cracks online.  Although it is from a small base, this business continues to 
 grow.  This business we are doing is also better than the NYMEX look-a-like 
 business in that we are developing a mix of counterparties who are paying the 
 bid/offer. Today's counterparties included Valero, Hess, Cargill and Bank of 
 America. 
 
 Next week we will launch our NYMEX heat and gas crack products.  Many of our 
 counterparties have expressed interest in this product so we believe our 
 volumes will continue to grow.
