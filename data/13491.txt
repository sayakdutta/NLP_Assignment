 Dear Tom:
  The fully executed copy is on its way to you.  Thanks for all of your
 cooperation in bringing this matter to a close.  I will file the dismissal
 papers and will copy you on them.
 Best regards,
 Linda
 
 
     
 
 I have no problem with a non-notarized signature if it meets with your
 approval.
