 unless we are required to do so by law, regulation or order.

 Lindy,
 I agree with Lynn -- not only for the valid reasons she articulated, but 
 because I think we may have a conflict of interest here.  You see, 
 Transwestern is a formal party to the GIR proceeding.  As such, we are 
 currently involved (albeit indirectly) in negotiations with SoCal and other 
 parties regarding the ability [and mechanism] for SoCal to recover costs to 
 implement unbundled services on their system.  System pooling is one of those 
 services.
   
 I'll defer to counsel on this, but in my humble opinion, I don't think it 
 wise for TW to offer SoCal any kind of cost figure to base its estimates on.  
 First, its probably not good form for one party to the proceeding to give 
 another party information that could prove to be prejudicial.  Secondly, and 
 probably more practically, if Transwestern were of a mind to, it could 
 intentionally skew the results of their survey. 
 
 Unless collective wisdom feels differently, I'd suggest we politely decline 
 on some reasonably nebulous basis, i.e. --- we don't know... we forgot.... we 
 really didn't account for it separately... it's been too long.... the people 
 who might have known are no longer here... whatever.   That way we don't 
 appear uncooperative, just incompetent!  
 
 I'm kidding.  Just let me know how else I can help here.

 Sheila and Lindy, I am not sure I am comfortable giving them any costs.  On 
 timing, it varies so much between
 companies based on systems, manpower, etc.   Maybe we should discuss before 
 giving them anything?
 Thanks. Lynn

 Do you want us to proceed with gathering this data for SoCal?

 As you may be aware, SoCalGas is going through Gas Industry Restructuring.? 
 One of our settlement proposals is to provide pooling service.? We have been 
 asked to compare our estimate for cost and development time with others who 
 have implemented pooling service on their system.? Therefore, if you have a 
 ballpark figure of the cost incurred to develop pooling and approximately how 
 long it took to build from the time you provided requirements to your 
 implementation date, we would appreciate it very much.? If you have any 
 questions, you can e-mail me or call me at (213) 24r-3812.
