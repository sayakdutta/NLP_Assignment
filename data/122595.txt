 Attached please find a "draft" notice that SoCalGas plans to post on our EBB regarding the new interconnect at Kramer Junction plus expanded capacities at North Needles and Wheeler Ridge.  In this notice we describe how the allocation of capacity will be made and that this is an interim measure until the implementation of the Comprehensive Settlement for firm capacity rights on the SoCalGas system.  This notice will be posted within the next couple of days.
 If you have any questions, please give me a call at (213) 244-3812.  Thanks, Pat
