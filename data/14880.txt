 How are things going at home?  I hope ya'll are settling in a bit and things
 are going smoother.
 
 We had our trustee meeting last night and the subject of inventory came up.
 I remember two or three years ago, we took an extensive inventory and that
 each head of each group at the church inventoried their items.  I remember
 doing the sanctuary and Steve doing the music inventory.  Do you know where
 all the paperwork is?  Do you have it on your computer or does Lisa or
 someone else?  If so, could you email it to me?  or give me the originals?
 Jim said he didn't see it in the stuff you gave him.  He also can't find the
 Trustee Master Binder; do you know where it is?
 
 Thanks.
 
 Syd  see you Saturday depending on how my gum surgery goes on Thursday.
