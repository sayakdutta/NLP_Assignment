 Vicki, Mike & Bob:  Attached is the revised summary of the negative CTC 
 issues/positions/exposure items etc. reflecting the comments of Mike Day.  It 
 is somewhat longer than I hoped, but it seemed to make sense to list all of 
 these various items so that they are all on the table as we make decisions 
 going forward.  Could you please distribute to whoever else should get this.  
 Please call me if you have any questions.  John
