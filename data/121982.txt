 
 sounds good.  K.
 
 
     
 
 All three weekends were available, but Jim & Hattie (our hosts) can't do it
 the 10th.  Let me go back to Jane with the 10th, since we know that won't be
 GG.  OK?  JW
 
 
     
 
 What were the offer dates for the Gormet Group?  Didn't we offer all
 three weekends?  I'm open all three weekends in November, however, we
 might want to steer clear of the 17 just incase we decide to travel
 during the week of Thanksgiving.
 
 Thanks, Kim.
 
 
     
 
 Kim - Any reason I can't tell Jane 11/3?  That's one of the Gourmet
 Group
 dates, but we can steer that to the 17th, I think.  Or should I offer
 Jane
 the 10th?  Did you have a conflict then?  JW
 
 
     
 
 Pencil in the 3d and the 17th.  We'll narrow it down to one or the other
 shortly.
 
 Looking forward to it!
 
 John
 
 
     
 
 John,
 Thank you for the invitation.  We'd love to come.  We don't have any
 plans
 for Saturday, November 3rd, 10th or 17th.  Let us know.  Have a good
 weekend
 and say hello to Kim.
 
 Thanks again,
 Jane
