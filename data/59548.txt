 The sitara mapping table is saved in the Netco file named CurveMappings.xls
 
 Check your regions and if you see any locations mapped to curves we won't be setting anymore, make a list of those and what the new mappings should be.  Once the new database is set up we will get with Russ to have those changed over.
 
 
 Thanks
