 
 Ted, here are a few suggested changes.
 Also, regarding the language you crossed out at the bottom of paragraph 1 
 (about notice of default, payment within 15 days, etc.), I do not think that 
 language was objectionable from a legal standpoint, and might actually be 
 helpful as far as giving them a payment deadline.  However, if it's 
 inconsistent with your procedures, or you just don't like having to give them 
 notice, I see no problem at all with crossing it out.

 Susan,
 
  Please review the attached guaranty for Sprague Energy.  I have made some 
 changes, but need your approval.
 
  Please advise if you need anything.
 
 Thanks,
