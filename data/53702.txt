 Thanks. He is graduating on June 16.
 By the way, did you see some of the movies I recommended
 to you?

 Thanks Vince!   I'm out of town but will check with Mark.
 
 Hope all is well with you!  Did your son graduate?  
 
 Take care!
 
 --Best!

 Christie,
 
 I sent this resume to Mark Palmer.
 Any other thoughts where he might fit?
 He is a very good friend of mine.
