 Individual logins are much more preferable.
 
 The UBS schedulers are

 Murray,
 
 We may need more logins if there are multiple people required to schedule.  These logins are to allw the ubs schedulers to continue to perform for us after there login is converted to the ubs system.  I would prefer that they have individual logins so we can audit who did what?
