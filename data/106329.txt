 Allison is writing her thank-you notes.  With gifts going in different
 directions after the wedding, cards were detached from boxes and envelopes
 were scattered in different directions.  Allison has not been able to account
 for everything, and while we're not trying to be rude, can you let us know
 what you sent so she can match everything up and thank you in writing.  Hope
 you had a good time.  Sorry I didn't get to spend more time with you.
 
 Love - Anita
