       Bob will be reporting into the Asset Development Group (which is you), but as you well know--we tend to blur alot of lines around here.  It is important to TCPL and all of the others to know that Bob does have direct access to Stan and me.  This is consistent with what Bill had originally talked to Bob about.  Okay?

 Danny,
 
 It's ok by me if Bob reports to you on ANNGTC - - - I'm ready to step in any time if this reporting structure becomes burdensome and will stay in the info loop at any rate.

 This afternoon I called Paul to let him know that I am getting involved with the A to B Alaskan activities on behalf of Enron, not Northern Border.  He was ok with my involvement and will let Tony Palmer and Dennis McConaghy know.  He asked if you were remaining involved and I said yes that I would report to you on this project.  He asked me to let you know that he has a call into you regarding getting the joint development agreement going on the B to C line.  Bob Hill
