 Please plan on attending a meeting on Friday, January 12 at 1:30 p.m. in the 
 Boardroom for a "dry-run" of the Analyst Meeting presentations.  This session 
 is intended to review the content of each presentation, and also to insure a 
 consistent message among all presentations and Enron attendees.  Please call 
 Paula (x3-7209) or myself (x3-5981) if you have any questions.
