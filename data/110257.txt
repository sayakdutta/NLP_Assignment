 I continue to write to you, but you don't write back.  That's nice.
 Anyways, I heard that Skamania lodge is a cool place to stay.  It is in
 Washington, but just across the river from Hood River.  I don't know what
 you think about that.  If you want, I can contact them.  I'll wait to hear
 from you....
