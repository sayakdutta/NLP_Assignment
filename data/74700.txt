 What's the name of the organization that would have sent the form in?

 Hi there,
 
 I participated in an FFA auction with Matagorda County Fair, and gave my
 assistant the receipts to fill out the matching forms.  Unfortunately, she
 has since had surgery and isn't in the office.  The receipts are no longer
 on her desk, and the current temporary assistant doesn't know anything
 about it.  I was wondering whether a prior temp might have sent them in.
 Please let me know.
 
 Thanks,
