 Activity levels in Credit Risk Management (CRM) have never been higher due to 
 very volatile commodity markets, growth in EES and many other factors. In 
 order to address these market changes, effective now, Ken Curry will transfer 
 from Rick Carson's Due Diligence group to CRM and report to Bill Bradford. 
 Ken has a strong background in credit related issues and should be able to 
 immediately add value to the CRM group. 
 
 It is fortunate that adequate depth exists within RAC to be able to realign 
 personnel as market needs suggest. Please join me in congratulating Ken on 
 his move and in wishing him success in this new assignment.
