 Jeff:
 As you may be aware SoCal Edison has announced their intention to sell their 
 interest in the Mohave Generating Station to AES. Would you know if SCE has 
 to file for approval of this transaction with the CPUC? I looked on the CPUC 
 website but couldn't find a docket/proceeding number. As the operator of the 
 Black Mesa slurry line we have a vested interest in this and I may want to 
 file as an interested party in the CPUC proceeding. Thanks.
 Fred
