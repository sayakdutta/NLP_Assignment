 
 Below is a parking problem we have with IROQ.  In this example, we were 
 notified 1 month after the effective flow date.  Comments?
 
 Angie has documentation from Iroq that she will leave on your desk.  
 
 Angie, for now, please schedule this as parked as current day activity.

 Just an FYI update on the Iroquois 06/26 parking issue.  This might be 
 redundant, but the history is that Iroquois notified us on 07/26/00 that we 

 cycle of 06/26/00 (yes, exactly one month lag in notification), & the cut 
 volume was placed into PALS.  As I understand it, the late notification was a 

 us when they found out.  Anyway, the 364 MMBtu's are on the August 
 Transportation Statement as a beginning balance on 08/01, not withdrawn, 
 incurring parking charges of $173.77 for the month (364 MMBtu's x 31 days = 

 item, it sounds like we've got a problem with the late notification, & this 
 parking charge is related, & so, may be disputable.  Either way, the volume's 
 currently not in Unify as parked, & will not show up on the Service 
 Verification at present.  
 
 Are there any updates to the status on this item?  Thanks.

 Brad-
 
 I got your message this morning, and I'm not ignoring you- I have just been 
 extremely busy with bid week activities and cleaning for August.  I think I 
 know what you're talking about, and I handed that issue over to Chris Germany 
 earlier this month.  I have not followed up with it since then, and that is 
 my fault.  The main problem I have with this that we were not notified about 
 the volume change until later the NEXT MONTH which would not be a timely 
 notification by any means.  I think that Chris was looking into this issue 
 with Colleen Sulllivan, because of the late notification.  I will badger 
 Chris in the morning, but I can't guarantee an answer until later this week 
 after the dust has settled from the 1st.  Thanks for understanding.  -Angie
