 Hi Aunt Bonnie,
  
 It is great to hear from you.  We really missed the fact that your trip was delayed because of 9/11.  Things will be pretty hectic this weekend with Jason's bachelor party and my birthday.  We are going to dinner tomorrow night for my birthday to a restaurant that I have never tried. It should be good.
  
 On Saturday, we will be celebrating Jason's bachelor party.  We are going on a casino cruise out of Galveston.  I am looking forward to it.  
  
 When do you think that you are going to make it down for a visit?  How is the weather treating you up there?
  
 It was nice to hear from you.
  
 Love,
 
 Eric
 
 
     
 
 
 Hi Eric,
 
 I know this weekend will be a busy one for you but I just wanted to wish you an early Happy Birthday.  Hope all is well with you and Shanna.  I hope to see you in a few months.
 
 Love   Aunt Bonnie
