 Kevin,
 
 In connection with Lisa's preparation of the FASH for this transaction, she has asked whether there are any "hedges" that need to be unwound.  I told her that from our conversations, I was of the opinion that there were (approx. $5,000,000 in costs associated with the unwind).  Please confirm.
