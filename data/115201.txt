 
 These deals have a contact name - Don Imamura - in them now. I asked Tracy 
 Ngo, our credit person, about NCPA's credit status, and she said that since 
 they've been done, it's now a matter of risk management or damage control - 
 if it should even come to that. At any rate, the deals are good and now have 
 contact info.
 
 Thanks,

 There are 4 deals for Northern CA Power Agency and they have wonderful notes 
 about confirming them together.  However, I need a contact name, and isn't 
 NCPA on the credit watch list?
 
 Thanks!
