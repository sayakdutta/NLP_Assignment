 I hear people talking about some of these articles (like the NY Times article this weekend and the Off Wall Street article a few weeks ago) and they don't know what to think.  The general employee population does not understand our financials and how Enron "makes markets". - At least this is my perception based on conversations that I hear in the elevators and on the bus on my to/from work.  
 
 Anyway, my observation is that the problem with being misunderstood does not reside just on the outside.
