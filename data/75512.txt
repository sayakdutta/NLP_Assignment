 
 Good idea about taking the sausage.
 
 Are you going to the store?  If you do, I could use some Diet Coke, silver 
 and gold.
 
 
 
 


   
  
 Sounds great!
 I wish I would have thought to get some smoked venison out at noon. We could
 have cooked a package and the taken some with us this weekend. Do you want
 to take your dad some?
 See you tonight sweetie.

 Guess what?  The closing party isn't until Feb. 8.  I had the wrong week!
 Glad I didn't show up on the wrong day....
 
 BEAUTIFUL weather.  Might want to sit outside and have a little cocktail
 (or equivalent) tonight.  I had Mexican food for lunch, so popcorn for
 dinner!
 
 Love,
