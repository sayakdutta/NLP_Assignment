 
 In light of the recent events here at enron and the uncertainty surrounding all of our employment, I would like each of you to have my home email address so that you can keep in touch.  No matter what happens, the work email address will change, whether I stay at Enron and we are aquired or I change companies.  Who knows what will happen or what the timing will be!  Donations can be made to - just kidding!  Hope all is well with all of you!
