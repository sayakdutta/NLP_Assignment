 ATTACHED IS AN IMPORTANT ORGANIZATION ANNOUNCEMENT THAT SHOULD GO OUT TO ALL 
 GPG EMPLOYEES IMMEDIATELY:
 
 The timeliness and confidentiality of this announcement have made it 
 impossible for us to use the Notes Team to handle distribution via e-mail, as 
 would normally be the case.  As a result, please forward the message to 
 everyone in your respective department(s).
 
 Note to those of you whose departments include field locations:  We are 
 sending the announcement to all field locations via burst FAX, so you should 
 not need to e-mail copies.  Faxes will be distributed at approximately 10:30 
 this morning.
 
 Please call Lisa Costello (x31819) if you have any questions.
