 
 Janelle:
 
 I reviewed the email of 1/19/01 from Ben Chu.  There are only 2 items listed:
 
 (1)  I will beef up the language to make it absolutely clear that ENA can 
 select the price only if it hears from ConEd first.
 
 (2)  I am not sure that I agree about the NY ISO changing pricing after 30 
 days.  We will need to discuss.  I have heard that this is not as frequent an 
 occurrence as in the past and we are using the same mechanism as the ISDA 
 procedure for change in prices.
 
 (3)  Other than the foregoing, he had no other comments exept to say that he 
 would review again.
