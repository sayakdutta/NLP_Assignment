 Cindy,
     No.  I'll give her mine and Eric's.  I fear that if she has Stan's, he'll get random calls that shouldn't rise to his level, and you'll lose control of your ability to screen his calls for priority.

 Excellent, Dan!    Jane is asking for Stan's cellular....is it absolutely critical that she have his cell number?   I try not to give it out unless absolutely necessary.   And then she's looking for what "function" he will be responsible for.
 
 Thanks for handling this!

 Hello,
 
 I am in the process of establishing a Contact List for the Withdrawn
 partners.  Would you please check the information I have on you and confirm
 that it is correct and would you supply any information that is missing.
 
 Also, would you indicate what function each individual is responsible for
 eg. , MOU, Technical, Regulatory, Commercial or Legal.  I will update the
 list once I have more information.  Thanks very much for your help.
