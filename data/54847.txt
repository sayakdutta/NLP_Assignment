 Ms. Geman,
 
 I apologize for the delay, but I finally have drafted an Escrow Agreement for 
 placing the software in escrow with your attorneys.  Please review and have 
 your attorneys review and let me know if it is acceptable.
 
 I will be leaving the department I have been working in and moving to a 
 different Enron subsidiary on October 13.  If at all possible, could we try 
 to get the Software License Agreement and the Escrow Agreement wrapped up 
 before I leave so that someone else does not have to try to pick up where I 
 left off?
 
 I think we are just about in agreement on the Software License portion.  
 Seems like the only outstanding question had to do with your concern 
 regarding providing a response time of 2 business days.  I do not have any 
 answers regarding that - maybe Vince Kaminski or Stinson Gibner can respond 
 on this issue.  
 
 I look forward to hearing from you and trying to get this finalized within 
 the next 2 weeks if possible.
 
 Thank you,
 
 Karla Feldman
