 I have got my page set-up in excel to print all the info.  The info is there.  I just don't think that Kim has her excel page setup to print the info (I assume she is the one printing it out for you).  Do you want me to call her?

 this isn't rocket science.  can you put 10 or 20 analysts on trying to get the aeco basis trades to print on the same page.
