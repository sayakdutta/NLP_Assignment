 Gentlemen,
 
 Thankyou for your fine effort. I'll e-mail thru Thurs eve (Sydney time) what
 we have done to incorporate it into our material (which wasn't toooo
 painful) to see if it is OK with you. A couple of quick questions though.
 
 Vince - your section had a number of footnote numbers, but no actual
 footnotes - can you please resend them?
 
 Grant - I agree it would be good to have the final figure. What happens if
 you plot the historical data and the simulations on the same graph - but
 with different axis?
 
 Many thanks and best regards.
 
 Chris.
