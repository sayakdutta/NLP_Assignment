 Debra,
 
 I spoke with Andrea Dilman of Occidental Energy Marketing, Inc. at (713) 215-7673 who said she sent you the GISB amendment with her comments in July and is still waiting to hear from you.  
 
 Also, Idacorp is still waiting for us to send them the GISB amendment.  This is the counterparty that previously returned the amendment to us with a stamp rather than an actual signature.  I think Stacy said she would look into it or get Alisha to work on it.   
 
 Please be on the look out for executed amendments from Midcoast Marketing, Inc. and Kinder Morgan Texas Pipeline, L.P.  They have both faxed me their copies of the executed amendments.
 
 I gave your business card to Karla Dent of Texaco and asked her to give you a call.  She told me she is swamped because of the pending merger but would give you a call.
 
 Ann
