 Penny and Lynn,
 I would like to set a meeting for us to discuss a problem that has developed with Amarillo Natural Gas deliveries at POI 62119 - CRI Seaboard and POI 78158 - Circle Land & Cattle.  Due to the rules that govern the Bushton Universe, Amarillo Natural Gas is not able to find gas to purchase at the receipt points that are labeled for these deliveries.
