 Mark,
 
 GM wants us to look at this new NDA with an Exclusivity clause in it.   I will
 look into the business side of agreeing to an Exclusivity clause within the automotive
 sector for our proposition.  From your end, what has been the general position on exclusivity.
 See agreement attached below.
 
 Talk soon
 
 John
 
 
 

  
 
 John-
 As previously discussed, please find attached the NDA (non-disclosure agreement)
 which includes automotive industry exclusivity.  Please review and provide
 feedback to Dan or I.  Thanks
 (See attached file: NDA with EAconf.doc)
