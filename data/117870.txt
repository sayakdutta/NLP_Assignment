 options might be a problem.  However, if the customer is not a US entity, the 
 advice is all given outside the US and does not relate to US futures or 
 options, we feel reasonably comfortable that the risk is quite low that there 
 would be a problem.

 Thanks for the response.  Does the term "futures contract" also include 
 bilateral swaps (or it restricted to exchange-traded futures) and will it 
 make any difference if the couterparty/customer is a non-US entity?!

 I think the answers will be the same for Stockholm - i.e. as long as we are 
 not giving advice with respect to futures contracts (valuations or trading 
 advice) or handling customer funds there should not be any Commodity Exchange 
 Act issues.

 Mark, the business people posted at ECTRIC's office in Stockholm want to 
 offer a Swedish forestry group portfolio management services and advisory 
 services.  With reference to our previous conversations on the subject below, 
 do you think that this may entail problems under US securities laws?!

 Mark:
 
 Did you have any luck with your New York law firm contact.   The other party 
 has accepted the contents of the contract and wish to sign on Tuesday next 
 week, why it's a bit urgent to flag any US securities law implications 
 associated with the relevant transaction.
