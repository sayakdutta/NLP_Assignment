 I thought I'd send this around just as a reminder of the RMT guidelines.  As

 Attached please find the most recent guidelines for confirming swap 
 transactions with RMT.  Please distribute this memorandum to others involved 
 in the confirmation process, as appropriate, and feel free to call me at
