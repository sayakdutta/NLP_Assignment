 have all the time zones as a choice in Deal Blotter if EnPower is going to 
 sort them out anyway. We're just doubling up on the work that the application 
 already knows how to do. In the meantime, I'll sort through these deal 
 numbers and change time zones that flow over the first week in April. Let me 
 know if that sounds good.

 Yep, the time zone glitch.  I think he was looking at all deals in the 
 system.  I almost think we should deal with this April, and worry about the 
 rest when it comes up.   Will and I are also kicking around making the only 
 choice in deal entry PPT.  Let Enpower sort out the rest.  We can modify 
 stuff on the strip level, but PPT would be the only choice in blotter and at 
 the top of regular deal entry.
 
 How does that sound?

 I'm unclear as to what Will found in these deals that needs to be looked at. 
 The first one (scary!!) has notes in the comments section of each leg that 
 say it was terminated on 9/30/98; however, there are still forward deal legs 
 that haven't been killed or zeroed out. I don't think I could consider myself 
 a deal control professional on this one - I'll need to talk to a trader. But 
 let me know what you want me to look for in the remaining deals. Is this part 
 of the time zone glitch?

 Do you want to look into these, the first one made me nearly wet my pants!  I 
 think I want a deal control professional on this one.............   :)
