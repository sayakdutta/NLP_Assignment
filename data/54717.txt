 Vince,
              Herewith is a write-up I gave at the Research Meeting yesterday 
 on the worst-case-loss efforts I have been working on for the Equities 
 portfolio.  It is based on Wilmott's CrashMetrics and delta-gamma portfolio 
 optimization.  The goal is to ascertain how much possible loss a portfolio 
 can have, based on historical data.  Comments are welcome.
 
 Regards
 Naveen
