 there have to at least be questions.  i used to get a curve report that 
 showed curve graphs on a volume bar chart.  have you looked at anything like 
 that lately?  you can find problems with a pretty quick scan.
 
 
 
 
     
 
 This person hasn't found a violation in a year.  I find that hard to believe.
