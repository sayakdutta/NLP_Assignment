 Mr. Presto,
 I just changed it for you. I went to the menu to the left of the page where
 it says "Edit Portfolio". I then Changed the name at the top of the Edit
 Portfolio page. At the bottom of the Edit Portfolio Page, I hit the "Submit"
 button. Whenever you make a change, you then have to exit out of the
 portfolio tracker(ie: go to home page) and then go back in.
 
 Thanks,
 Hank Emery
 
 
     
 
 I am trying to change name to "Presto - Enron" and it won't let me.   How
 do I change name?

    It's done!
 
    
                 
 
    Portfolio looks good.   Is it valuing options properly?   Can you rename
    the portfolio "Enron"
 
    Thanks.
