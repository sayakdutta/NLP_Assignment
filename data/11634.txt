 Formation of International Credit Group- Bradford/Murphy
 Curve Validation Issue-Port/Gorte
 Steel Issues-Bradford/Gorte
 Rocar Progress/Implementation-Gorte
 Operational Risk Metrics/Implementation-Curry
 EES???-All
 Bankruptcy Group-Gorte/Carson/Tribolet/Bradford
 Retail Credit-Bradford/Carson
 Private Equity Trading-Gorte
 Credit Consistency study- Buy
 
 I think we should have a meeting to discuss above. Some are bigger than others. Organization and website need to adapt to current business environment. 
 
 If anything else belongs on this list let me know. Karen will set up meeting.
