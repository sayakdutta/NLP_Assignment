 Dear Mark,
 
 Thank you for your e-mail. I have asked around our business people about
 your inquiry.
 
 At the moment, there are no institution that stands out in that field in
 the Tokyo market. However, we, IBJ, are probably the most enthusiastic
 about it. Historically, we have kept the strongest relationship with the
 electricity companies and oil refineries. Their bond issues keep our
 securities subsidiary on the top book runners list. Therefore, we are
 researching on the product. Other Japanese firms seem to be less
 interested.
 
 Although I would think it should take a while to persuade those most
 conservative companies like Tokyo Electricity et al., the product does
 have a potential here.
 
 In fact our derivatives and math men were really keen to talk to you and
 learn more about the product.
 
 Please let me know if I can be of any further help.
 
 Terry
