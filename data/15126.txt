 good job.
 
 
     
 
 Just to share.
 
  
     
 
 In case I did not already say so, this is a great move for us, and hopefully
 for you.  We need a big step-up in risk management in PBL and agency-wide.
 You will help us get there.
 
  
     
 
 
 
 	I'm pleased to inform you that Diane Cherry will be joining the Risk
 Management Group on an informal detail to help us get the PBL Risk Strategy
 completed.  The detail begins immediately.  Her skills and talents will be
 particularly helpful in  acheiving buy-in across the PBL, facilitating
 discussions, integrating the risk strategy work with the PBL indicators
 project, integrating with the Corporate review of PBL risk practices,
 leading change efforts and cultural issues, and generally structuring and
 following a process that will be successful in getting a strategy in place
 and implementation underway.  She will be accompanying me at first in a wide
 variety of risk related activities/meetings to 'get her bearings'.    The
 duration of this assignment is open ended but expected to last several
 months.  Please welcome her and treat her as one of our team members.
