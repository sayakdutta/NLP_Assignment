 
 Neil,
 
 I would like to apologize for the confusion regarding Anshuman.
 We have floated a number of possible scenarios regarding his
 trip to Houston and there was a lot of confusion
 regarding the terms (given that I was talking to Sandeep
 every few days).
 
 Currently, we expect Anshuman to come   to Houston for one month
 to work on the DPC  project (at Jeff Shankman's request). The lawyers advised
 me that we need an L1  visa  for him, irrespective of the duration
 of  his stay.
 
 Sorry for the confusion.
