 We did the swap with Pan Energy on 4/28-30 only.  On those days, we received all the gas at Carthage, nothing at Castle Busby.  When we are not operating under the swap, Duke markets the gas that usually comes in at Castle Busby.  Apparently, they sold the gas to Highland in April.

 Daren:
 Did we exchange with Panenergy in April?  If we did, can you send me your nom sheet?  Meter 7052-Castle Busby looks different this month.  Elsa did some deals with Highland Energy at 7052.  We normally buy all of the gas from Duke at this meter when we exchange.  There also wasn't flow every day, so Duke's volume is very small.
 
 Thanks,
 Megan
