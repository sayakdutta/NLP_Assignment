 over the past cuple of years in California.  Maybe I can make a believer out 
 of you.

 Also just wanted to thank you for being so honest with me the other day.  I 
 know it was difficult and I am sorry that  I never made it easy on you to 
 express your true thoughts.  Maybe I just chose to ignore them for my own 
 selfish reasons.
