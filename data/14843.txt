 I'm not sure if you are the person I need to be contacting, so if you're not 
 maybe you can lead me in the right direction.
 
 I am in the process of working on a gas well in Hodgeman County, Kansas;
 Section 18, T21S, R22W.  The BTU test for a well in the vicinity came back 
 at 723BTU.  699.25 Methane, 14.64 Ethane, 4.77 Propane, 1.3 Isobutane, 0.98 
 Normal Butane, 0.4 Isopentane, 0 Normal Pentane, 1.51 Hexanes.  Mole % is 
 69.45 Methane, 0.83 Ethane, 0.19 Propane, 0.04 Isobutane, 0.03 Normal 
 Butane, 0.01 Isopentane, 0 Normal Pentane, 0.03 Hexanes, 28.45 Nitrogen, 
 0.04 Oxygen, 0 Carbon Dioxide, 0.93 Helium, and 0 Hydrogen.
 
 Do you have a pipeline in the vicinity, and would you be able to purchase or 
 transport the forementioned quality of gas.
 
 If you could inform me on pipelines who could service this well please send 
 me an e-mail.
 
 Thank you.
