 There is an executed Assignment Agreement transfering CES's transactions with 
 Bank of Montreal to ENA.  The CES Master Agreement was not terminated, but is 
 inactive.
 
 
    
  
 Re:  Bank of Montreal and ENA, have we terminated the CES agreement (and has 
 credit agreed)?  I don't know how Susan F. "inactivated" the CES ISDA with 
 BOM,  We are in the process of negotiating with BOM in connection with our 
 Japanese affiliate.  Sara
