 Sent by: Enron Europe General Announcement




  
  
 
 We are pleased to announce the formation of the Credit Markets Group which is 
 responsible for developing innovative products to better manage the risk of 
 our internal credit portfolio as well as, looking  for opportunities to 
 provide third party credit protection.  Initially, we will be making markets 
 in bankruptcy protection on reference credits which are currently in our 
 portfolio but we expect to add additional credit products and reference 
 credits very quickly.
 
 The team will utilise EnronOnline as its primary trade execution tool, 
 looking to quickly build market share by capturing the eyes of our current 
 counterparts.  Simultaneously,  we will launch an external web site focused 
 on credit protection where potential customers will have access to real time 
 prices and filter on specific reference credits as well as, access to credit 
 models and research papers on effective credit risk management.  Utilising 
 e-commerce business principles, we expect to aggressively claim the space for 
 corporate credit protection.  We expect to make a public announcement about 
 these new products in late January.
 
 In order to effectively access the global market for credit protection, the 
 group will be based in London with an initial local desk set up in Houston as 
 well.  Bryan Seyfried will be transitioning out of RAC, where he was 
 responsible for the Trading Controls and Research teams in Europe, to lead 
 the group and he will report to me.
