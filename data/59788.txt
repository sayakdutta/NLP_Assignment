 Tammy Shepperd is the person to contact.
 
 Tammy can you please sort out Caroline - same issues as Mike McDonald but New York.

 Louise, I talked in detail with Caroline this am. We need to identify where Caroline is going to reside. I understand that UBS has two operations in NY - I think you and Hutchins need to decide what makes the most sense (ie synergies). It is critical that we get this resolved so that Caroline has some infrastructure around her.
