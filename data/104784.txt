 Sara:
 
 I attach a clean copy of the nondisclosure agreement, which I have dated as
 of today.  As we discussed, if you fax a signed copy of the agreement to me
 tomorrow, I'll have it signed on behalf of Bertelsmann and fax it back to
 you.  We will then exchange originals by mail.  It has been a pleasure
 working with you on this.
 
 Regards,
 Jackie
