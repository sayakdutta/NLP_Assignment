 
 Debbie,
 
 I can't remember if I responded to you....I took vacation all last week.
 
 Things are fine in my little corner (as good as can be expected).  A bit sad for a lot of other people around here.
 
 As soon as I get caught up, I'll give you a call.
 
 Mark
 
 
     
 
 So how are things in your shop?
