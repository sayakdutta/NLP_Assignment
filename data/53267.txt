 
 Alexander,
 
 Sorry for a delay in responding to your message.
 I don't anticipate at this point any hiring at Enron for
 my group over the next 12 months. I shall contact you
 if the situation changes.

 Dear Mr. Kaminski,
 
 I was referred to you by Dr. Shi-Jie Deng of the
 Georgia Tech School of ISyE. He suggested I send my
 resume to you because of my interest in the Energy
 Industry.
 
 I will be receiving my master's degree in Quantitative
 and Computational Finance from Georgia Tech in
 December 2001. My academic background also includes a
 strong emphasis on research, Mathematics, and Physics.
 
 Attached is my resume for your review. I would greatly
 appreciate the opportunity to discuss my interest in a
 position with Enron and will contact you within a
 week. If you'd prefer to contact me, I can be reached
 during the evening at (404) 451-6432, or by email.
 Thank you in advance and I look forward to speaking
 with you.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Alexander Panoutsakos
 327523 Georgia Tech Station
 Atlanta, GA 30332
