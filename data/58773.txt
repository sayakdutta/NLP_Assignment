 Steve:  Thanks for the quick and candid feedback.  Global markets still had=
  a presence here and in Tokyo -- I am working that angle as well.  Thanks a=
 gain.  ACD
  
     
 thanks Anthony.  It's difficult to see so many smart, hard working people i=
 n the kinds of circumstances you describe.  Unfortunately, I'm going throug=
 h some of the same things (on a smaller scale).  We are having to let peopl=
 e go in my organization.  I simply don't have room, even for a qualified pe=
 rson like Maurice.
 Does Global markets still have a presence in Singapore?  If so, perhaps the=
 re is an opportunity there.
 
  
     
 Steve and Rick:  You may have heard that EBS is winding down its business i=
 n the Asia Pacific region.  This is, of course, greatly disappointing for e=
 veryone involved but is the right thing to do given the status of the indus=
 try here.  We have a great team in the region and I am trying to help membe=
 rs of the team find new homes in Enron.  Along those lines, I wanted to bri=
 ng Maurice Nunas to your attention.  Maurice joined EBS this past June and =
 is Director of Government Affairs for the region.  We were fortunate to lan=
 d Maurice from Motorola in Singapore.  Maurice is a recognized expert  on t=
 elecommunications regulations in Asia, and has excellent working relationsh=
 ips with a number of governmental bodies and NGOs across the region.  In a =
 short period of time Maurice has made significant progress on a number of g=
 overnmental and regulatory issues that were facing us in the region.  He ha=
 s proven adept at picking up the fundamentals of the Enron business model a=
 nd has skills that would transfer across a number of commodities.  Maurice =
 is interested in staying with Enron and working in Houston, elsewhere in No=
 rth America or in the Asia Pacific region -- since he is new to Enron and d=
 oes not have extensive relationships around the organization I thought I wo=
 uld forward his cv to you as you are in a superior position to know what th=
 e various business units' needs may be.  Thanks for your consideration -- p=
 lease feel free to forward Maurice's resume or to let me know what I can do=
  to further his placement in Enron. =20
 
 I hope all is well with both of you.  Regards.=20

 Anthony and Chor-Lim,
 
 Thank you for agreeing to help me market myself within Enron.  Since I am s=

 Here is my updated CV and a companion paper providing more detail.  Please =
 distribute them as you deem appropriate.
