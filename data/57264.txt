 Vince, Berney asked me to send you a copy of our spread option models.  The 
 first is a more detailed spread option model created by Jim Simpson 
 (currently in the Chicago office), the second is a simplified version of 
 Simpson's model that I put together for less complicated tolling structures.  
 Please let me know if you have any questions or would like to discuss.
 
 - Jim
