 up everyone's time and attention that I think it makes sense to reschedule 
 for a later date.

 Mark, would it would it be possible to move the meeting to 2 PM Houston time 
 today?  If there are schedule conflicts or if a room is not available then 
 perhaps we can reschedule it for after the Holidays.
