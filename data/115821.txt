 These traders' heads are starting to spin with all the variations on 
 counterparty names, as I'm sure yours is as well!
 
 Thanks,

 One more question, I promise.  Bob Badeer did this deal and entered it as 
 Sierra Pacific Industries and I just changed it to Holding Company.  Should 
 it have been Sierra Pacific Power Company because the delivery is Palo Verde 
 and the Holding Co. deals are all SP15.
