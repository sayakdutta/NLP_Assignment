 
 I don't think CES has transport on these pipelines.
 
 I should have February to you by next week some time.
 
 
 
 
 

    
 
 Chris,
 I am missing support for MICHON, AWGC, TRUNKLINE, WNG and NGPL.
 
 Also, I can't remember when you said we would be getting Feburary.
 
 
 Thanks for all your help.
