 
 Paula,
 
 Works for me. Maybe we should go out and explore some other options
 in the Montrose/Heights area.

 Communications
   
 We are lo-o-o-o-ng overdue for a meeting of the round table and it is time to 
 work this into our schedules.
 
 Please respond and let me know if Thursday, April 27th will work for 
 everyone. I think LaGriglia would be a good place but am open to any and all 
 suggestions. 
 
 Thank you
 
 Paula
