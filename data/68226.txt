 Lets make it for like an hour.  I think once we get together we are going to find that we all have a lot of questions.  How about next week?  Like Wednesday afternoon.  Thats the only day that I can do it.

  What do you think about setting up a meeting between your group and mine in which each of us gives a short 15 minute presentation on what we do and how things other groups do affect our group.  If you think we will need more time, maybe we set up two meetings.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.
