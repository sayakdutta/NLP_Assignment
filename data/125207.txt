 I will give you many hugs.
 Your biggest fan,

 A director was mean to me today and made me cry. That was what that last email was about. Another director was talking to me about it. That was why I was not available for your call. Please do not call and ask me about it. I do not want to talk about it around Fred and Ashley.
