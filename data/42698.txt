 Attached to the e-mail I am forwarding you will find the Enron Guaranty 
 Agreement that was forwarded to Altrade.  Could you review the comments of 
 Altrade and respond.  Also, I presume that Enron has provided a Guaranty to 
 Altrade for ENA's business.  You may well wish to use that as a starting 
 point.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Jeff

 I recently received Altrade's comments to the joint guarantee from Enron and 
 Peoples on behalf of Enovate.
 I would appreciate it if you can review the comments, so that we can provide 
 them with some feedback.
 
 Thanks
