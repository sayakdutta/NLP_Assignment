 
 Just back in from my front yard -- a military jet of some sort is circling my 
 neighborhood and making a tremendous racket!  Several of my neighbors were 
 also out, so I was not the only one staring at the sky.  I don't know whether 
 we'll see fireworks later or if we've already missed them.  Jose and Gigi's 
 party was attended by more kids than ever.  There were a lot of West U 
 parents I did not recognize, but there were some lawyers from the Latin 
 American section that I know, so we had at least a few people to talk to.  We 
 did not stay long, just had some of the good Goode & Company BBQ, helped Gigi 
 with the pinatas, and got home around 7.  The traffic on I-45 was really 
 starting to pile up so I am glad we left when we did.
 
 Enjoyed the weekend and I'm looking forward to your visit.
 
 Love,
 Sooz
