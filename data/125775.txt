 Critical Illness policies have been distributed for a week and a half.  There is a Premium Notice & Authorization form in each Critical Illness package.  Please sign and return to me immediately to ensure your coverage is not delayed.  All forms need to be sent to me by October 29th, 2001. 
 
 Thanks,
