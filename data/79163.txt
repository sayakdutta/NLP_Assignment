 
 Cindy,
     Check and see if PROFITX software is on Stan's computer (the icon will be on his windows screen).  If so, find out if he uses it and let Julie know.  Julie is trying to get it removed from a number of systems as the support for the software is $135.00/mo., and it is not a critical tool for us.  Thanks.
 
     If you need to reach me the afternoon, you can get me from 3:30 on at 713-345-3271.
 
 Dan
