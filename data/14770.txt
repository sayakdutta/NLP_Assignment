 
 Met sounds good
 
 
     
 
 Janice told me that he would be in the office today.  Would The Met be OK?
 
 Thanks, Ricki
 
 
     
 
 Somewhere convenient to Jim since he has to come from Beltway/EOTT.  Will he come down Wetheimer?  If so we can meet at Highland Village - Grotto is it?  Or if he comes down I-10n then ??
