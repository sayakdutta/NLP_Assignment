 Thanks.  DF

 Mr. Campbell and I will meet Dr. Komai from SoCal in the late morning or 
 early afternoon on the 19th in San Francisco.  After our discussions we will 
 meet the rest of the group back at the Hyatt.  It is doubtful that Dr. Komai 
 will have more than a couple of hours of information to share with the group 
 on the 20th so we might considered targeting a departure time in 
 mid-afternoon.
 
 Dr. Komai related that the PG&E press activity has caused concern at the 
 management level in SoCal and prompted a new round of rigorous sampling 
 efforts.
