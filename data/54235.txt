 
 Erik,
 
 I regret to inform you I had to cancel my presentation. 
 I am working on another presentation on the same topic for
 a different audience, and I shall send you the slides.

 Dear Sir,
 
 Unfortunately I could not attent the INFORMS 2000
 meeting in San Antonio. Since I am very interested in
 the topic you presented there, I would really like to
 read the paper you presented or have a look at the
 slides you showed.
 Could you please be so kind as to send me a copy of
 the paper? Or could you tell me where I might find
 your paper (already published)?
 Thank you so much.
 
 Yours sincerely,
 
 Erik Pruyt
