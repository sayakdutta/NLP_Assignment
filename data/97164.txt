 As most of you know Genia will be out of the office for a period of approximately 4 weeks from the 4th October. 
 
 During this period Alice Wright will, in addition to her other responsibilities, be available to assist in the preparation of cover sheets and other aspects of work normally performed by Genia. However, while Alice has spent some time with Genia over the past few weeks gaining an understanding of the preparation of EEI Cover Sheets, this is a new area for her and she will require both our assistance and patience.
 
 During this period, for example, it is likely that the attorneys will, from time to time, need to complete cover sheets using the credit work sheet and I would encourage all of you to spend some time with Genia to make sure that, if required, you will be able to perform this task. There are clearly other agreements which we all ask Genia to prepare and  any such agreements should be prepared by the attorneys until Genia's return.
