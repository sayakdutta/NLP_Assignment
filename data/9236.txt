 what is being requested!  Your note made this one fast and easy to handle.  
 Thanks.

 Hi there,
 Just giving you a heads up that I have submitted an eRequest for vpn.  I have 
 been instructed by the Resolutions Desk that I need vpn in order to use cable 
 on my home computer.  The eRequest required 2 manager's and a vice president 
 to be selected, (not sure if they need all of you to approve).
 
 Thanks,
 Avril
