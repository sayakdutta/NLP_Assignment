 Open season responses are due from shippers on Friday 11/17.  Please make 
 sure you canvass all your customers to find out who plans to respond and who 
 doesn't.  I would like to submit to Steve a list of who we expect to see 
 responses from, their anticipated volume, term, and price they're willing to 
 pay.
 thanks
 KH

 This week, make sure you call all your customers (if you haven't already 
 spoken with them) and discuss the non-binding open season.  Answer any 
 questions they might have, and reiterate the response deadline.  See if you 
 can get an idea if they plan on responding one way or the other.  
 
 thanks
