 
 I guess someone thought of this again.  I'll wait to see what Ben says.
 
 This is when I'm out of town, which is fine by me.

 I would suggest the week of the 19th through the 23rd. Wednesday and Thursday 
 evenings work well for business dinners/socials.
 
 I have always enjoyed Americas, Churascos, or Cafe Annie for business 
 gatherings.  I think that we should invite the Coral folks just to keep the 
 night interesting (we can also talk with them about other transaction 
 opportunities - they may be in the market for additional projects).
 
 Have any steps been taken to plan this event?  I can call John Jones at 
 Intergen to run the concept and dates past him.  Let me know.  I am in the 
 office until 2 pm on Wednesday and then on vacation on Thursday and Friday.

 Folks:
 
 I'd like to get everyone together for a closing dinner around the 1st of 
 March or so to commemorate the closing of the Intergen LM6000 deal. Other 
 people I'd like to invite include: Kevin Presto, Janet Dietrich, Lee Johnson, 
 Carolyn Campbell, John Keffer, George Kuchbach (sp?), John Jones, Doug 
 Pedigo, and Chris Colbert. We can also use this as an opportunity to talk to 
 Intergen about other transaction opportunities. Any thoughts on whether we 
 should invite the Coral folks?
 
  Please let me know your availability, and of any restaurant recommendations.
 
 Thanks,
 
 
 Ben
