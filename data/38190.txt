 Nice work
 
  
     
 The attached file has been created and is intended to be run daily, per Mike Grigsby.  It contains West gas prices as set for the day, and soon will include certain heat rate calculations.
 
  << File: West Prices 0925.xls >> 
 
 
 
 
 If you would prefer to not receive a copy everyday, let me know.  If you see any errors, please help me to identify them.
 
 Thanks,
