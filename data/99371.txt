 I just participated in a conference call of the PX committee.  Our counsel
 are urging the committee to clear them to commence an arbitration action to
 recover the PX's claim against SCE.  This may be followed by a judicial
 action seeking prejudgment relief in the form of an attachment.  A written
 memo will be circulated shortly to the committee summarizing this course of
 action.  The view seems to be that SCE has all but assured that it will be
 suing PX and all the participants, and why not take the initiative.  Any
 thoughts?
