 Hello Vince;
 
 Joseph Doucet has passed along your name to me, in regards to exploring
 opportunities between Enron, and the Natural Resources and Energy MBA
 students at the U.of A. I would be pleased to assist in any capacity, from
 helping organize an information session by Enron to our students in the fall
 at the U.of A., to co-ordinating job interviews for permanent or summer
 internship positions, and everything in between! My function is to assist
 MBA students and appropriate corporations to find each other! I look forward
 to hearing from you.
 
 Regards, Barry.
