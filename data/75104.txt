 
 I've just learned that this is a "West" deal for the sale of the LV Co Gen 
 units.  
 
 This deal was described as being the same as the Intergen deal.  King & 
 Spalding helped me on that one, and when I thought this was an East deal I 
 contacted Keffer for a conflicts check (there is none).  I haven't gone to 
 Mark with it yet, though.
 
 We have forms, etc for this, and I'm happy to provide whatever support I 
 can.  Please advise as to how you would like to proceed.

 Folks:
 
 I just got off the phone with Lee Johnson at GE. I described the overall deal 
 to him ("Intergen" style deal with the current 4 LV Cogen units, and a 
 purchase of 4 additional units as a replacement), but did not disclose that 
 the counterparty is Panda. Lee is totally on board, and thought this would be 
 a great transaction. Based on this, I think our GE risk is minimal, which 
 means that our primary commercial focus needs to be on making sure Panda is 
 prepared to transact, and if they remain as interested, making sure we 
 proceed with as simple a transaction as possible.
 
 I would suggest that we have an all hands conference call to discuss the 
 transaction as soon as possible.
 
 Fred-could you please contact everyone and set this up? I'm available all day 
 today, and tomorrow to 3 PM EST.
 
 As soon as I get the revised proposal from Lee, I will forward it to the 
 group.
 
 Regards,
 
 Ben
