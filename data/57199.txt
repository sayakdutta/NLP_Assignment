 Maureen was sick for the last few days.
 When she comes back, I shall ask her to start the process regarding
 a formal offer for you.

 Dear Dr. Kaminski,
 
 I would like to thank you and your colleagues, Dr. Gibner and Ms.
 Raymond-Castaneda, for taking the time to talk with me. I enjoyed the visit
 very much and will be looking forward to the opportunity of working as a
 summer intern at Enron. You mentioned that you will call me this week. In the
 event I'm not at home, please leave a message at my home phone number (713)

 
 Sincerely,
 Candice Kao
