 
 Getting alot of inquiries.
 
 The PUC has not yet voted on suspension of DA or related matters.
 Likely to get to those items on the agenda within the next 30-60 minutes.
 Looks as if the decision will 1) suspend DA beginning Sept. 20th and 2) include contract renewal in the suspension.  
 In addition, it appears that the proposal would give the Commission some latitude to enact retroactivity back to July 1 if deemed necessary (this is unclear and we're trying to get more details on this provision).
 Three key senators have sent a a letter to the PUC asking the PUC to provide recommendations to the Legislature on the conditions under which DA should be re-instated (since the letter is dated September 18th--though sent only yesterday--it appears that the Senate had an idea that the PUC was going to suspend).
 
 KEEP IN MIND THAT THE DECISION HAS NOT BEEN VOTED ON YET AND THE PROVISIONS LISTED ABOVE MAY CHANGE.
 
 We'll report back as soon as something happens.
 
 For folks who want to listen in, the number is:
 
 415.228.4550
 code = 92105
 
 Best,
 Jeff
