 
 That's funny, because that's the guy who Mike Swerzbin and Matt Motley told 
 me agreed to ADP the deal. I just gave him a call, but no answer. I'll try 
 back in a bit, but I think we should be fine considering Mark Watts 
 supposedly already agreed.
 
 Thanks a lot,
 Kate

 Hi Kate, the person at Southern that called Joe Hunter is Mark Watts.  His 
 phone number is (678) 579-3470.  He may be a trader.
 
 Let me know if you need anything else.
 
 Thanks,
 Melissa
