 Dear Mr. Shankman,
 ?
 We met during?your recent  presentation at Wharton.? I had several questions 
 about internship and  career opportunities in the oil and gas branch at Enron 
 for an MBA  graduate.? You asked me to send you my r,sum, (attached), and 
 offered to  put me in contact with people from that branch for further 
 information.?  
 ?
 As you will certainly notice, my past  experience is clearly focused on the 
 upstream activities.? Although I  am?highly motivated by this sector, I also 
 have a strong interest in  other?dimensions of the energy industry, 
 especially in the huge, dynamic  growth potential of the utilities branch.
 
 ?
 I would welcome any comments or questions  you may have concerning my 
 motivations and what I could offer Enron in  return.? Therefore, please do 
 not hesitate to contact me at home by phone  or by e-mail.
 ?
 I look forward to hearing from you in the  future.
 ?
 Thank you in advance, 
 ?
