 I'll be there, as will Sandi McCubbin.  Are you interested in going?  I 
 thought not.
 
  
     
 Don't know how I got on the list, but just got my invitation to the Western 
 Conference of PUCs meeting June 3-6 where the guest speakers are Frank Wolak 
 and Gary Locke.  Oh dear....
 
 Best,
 Jeff
