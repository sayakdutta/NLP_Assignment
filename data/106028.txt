 Please let me know if Russell sent revised worksheets to you guys.  I left a 
 message for him a few minutes ago.  I know he goes on vacation Thursday.  
 Thanks.

 Linda & Sharon,
 
 My primary job responsibility is to online trading, and right now EnronOnline 
 is quite a beast of a customer.  Because of that I please ask that you direct 
 any future questions you may have with respect to confirmations to our two 
 paralegals who handle the day to day trading, Susan Bailey at x34737 and 
 Stephanie Panus at x53249.  
 
 With respect to the two current Canadian confirmations, Sara Shackleton, an 
 attorney in our Group, is working with Credit to resolve the questions on the 
 Slater Steel and Casco credit worksheets.
