 I just met with Chris Gaskill and Kevin McGowan. We are in dire need of 
 analysts. I proposed the following and would like your buy-in:
 1- A return trip to Wharton to get more finance and engineering grads.
 2- An off cycle super Saturday based on the resumes we pull from the 
 collection Ted Bland put together.
 
 Thanks
