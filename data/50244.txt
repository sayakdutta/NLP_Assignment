 
 I am forwarding the resume of Wendell Licon who works for Enron
 in the HR department (executive compensation). He used to be an
 FX trader. I am thinking about moving him to research when his current boss
 is ready to release him.
 
 I think, however, that you
 should take a look at him as well and see if he fits your needs.

 Per your request, I've attached a copy of my resume.  Please let me know if 
 you have any questions.
