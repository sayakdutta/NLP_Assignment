 
 Dave,
 
 No problem. I shall do it  this weekend.
 
 Also, I left you a message regarding Grant Masson (a VP in my group
 who left and went to work for El Paso 2 months ago).
 
 I made a bet that he would be knocking on our door in a year. I lost. He 
 wants to come back 
 after 2 months.
 
 My recommendation is to take him back. He left on good terms and is quite 
 competent.
 I would also like to send a message to the group that the grass on the other 
 side
 of the fence may look greener, but in reality it may be painted hay. "The 
 Return of Grant 
 Masson" would demonstrate that Enron offers best long-term growth 
 opportunities (and that
 I am good manager).
 
 Grant would come back to his original  VP position. Can we short-circuit the
 hiring procedures for a VP.  Grant's body is still warm and we can just 
 re-instate
 him in the original position instead of going through all the loops required 
 to hire a VP.

 Vince, can you provide for me a detailed list of 2000 accomplishments, 
 strengths/weaknesses and feedback against the criteria for the 2000 PRC.  
 
 I need that in the next week or so.
 
 Thanks
 Delainey
