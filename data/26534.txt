 I would like to have our PRC meeting on Thursday, 6/8.  Because of trading, 
 we will not be able to start until noon.  Please confirm to me ASAP (by end 
 of day, TODAY)  that you will be available.  Please keep in mind that we will 
 went last time from 1:00pm until almost midnight.  Your commitment of this 
 date will include the evening hours, unless of course, we work quickly and 
 efficiently!!!  Sally's meeting is scheduled for Tuesday, 6/13, and I plan to 
 be on vacation on Friday, 6/9.  Therefore, this is the lastest date that we 
 can meet.  Please make every effort to make this work.
 
 Thanks.
