 Hello, Stephanie,
 
 I must first apologise for the delay in replying to your email/attachments
 fo 24 July.
 
 Our reply is for the ISDA with Vitol Capital Management, but I hope that
 once we have agreed the wording for this , we will be able to quickly
 implement ISDA's for the other Vitol and Enron entities involved ... I
 expect that we will just have to change the tax declarations, the address
 details and a few other similar minor items.
 
 Attached is a covering letter and revised draft schedule.
