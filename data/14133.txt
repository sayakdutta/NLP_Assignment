 I'm quite happy with the lay out of the plan (great flexibility), but have just a few comments/questions.
 
 Article 2.3, Can we make such a broad statement that is so biased toward the Company?
 
 Article 3.1, I think the max payment is 56 weeks.
 
 Article 5.2, Under failure to meet performance, can we reduce the 45 day period and reference oral notification as well as written notification?  One of my concerns is, if we notify someone that we accept their Voluntary application, but need them to work for the next 3-4 months, the employees' motivation level might be very low which will effect their performance level.  Or perhaps we can build a statement in to the Separation and Release Agreement stating that the completion of their transition of their role needs to be satisfactorily completed to receive the separation pay.
 
 Also, somewhat related, do we expect to have the involuntary severance plan amended anytime this year?  As I'm working out the next stage of involuntary severance reductions, just need to know if the calculation is likely to change.
 
 Thanks Michelle.
 
 Cathy

 Lizzette and Michelle, 
 Attached is a discussion draft of the plan document.  Please review and send to others who need or wish to review it.  I have designed flexibility into the Plan that should serve us well in the event of design changes.
