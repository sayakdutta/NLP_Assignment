 This week we will begin discussions on structure and pricing with GE 
 Plastics.  At the risk of getting committed to earnings delivery I thought it 
 would be helpful to give a range of value to us & GE at least before the 
 economics start to deteriorate in negotiations.  Currently the proposal would 
 require GE to step up to ten year fixed price positions that would create the 
 following split up of economics:
 
 Savings to GE $33MM PV
 Value to Enron $15MM with $10MM of this value in bookable mark to market
 $40 MM in capital invested in the Demand Side Management Projects.
 
 I think that this suggests there should be value in our outsourcing efforts.
 
 Thanks,
 Rodney
