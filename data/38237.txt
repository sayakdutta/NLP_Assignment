 
 That is fine under the circumstances, but why were they sitting around for a few months without me knowing?  
 
 Thanks,

 Hello,
 
 I didn't know you were going to be out today or I would have talked to you earlier.  We had to take some large PMA expenses today that had been sitting around for a few months.  They totaled up to about $7mil.  I did talk to Phillip about this so he knows it is coming.  
 
 Sorry for the bad news.
 
 Have a good weekend and maybe you'll see me on Monday.
