 Tana,
 
 Can you tell me which numbers the CA's are in the atty.fms?
 
 Thanks,

 As a general matter, you need to use the forms of Confidentiality Agreements 
 contained in the atty.fms bank, not the Swap Group's forms.  We have 
 developed a few of our own forms for special purposes, one, which is in the 
 swap forms database/current forms, protects the counterparty only, and is 
 used when Credit wants to get copies of financal statements from a 
 counterparty and protects the financial information being provided by the 
 counterparty.
 
 I have developed forms for use by the EnronOnline team, but those should not 
 be used for any Enron company except EnronOnline and Enron Net Works.
 
 For any other types of matters/projects, we would also use the forms 
 contained in the atty.fms bank.

 Tana,
 
 Could you please supply me with a copy of your current Confidentiality 
 Agreement?  Since we "copied" your group on the Enron Corp. Guarantee 
 Agreement, I thought we could do the same with the CA.
 
 Thanks,
 Genia
