 
 Can you please direct one of the paralegals to assist Angeline with getting 
 this documentation in place.  I thought Susan would be appropriate because 
 she handles internal masters, but I understand she is only responsible for 
 RMT Masters.

 Tana,
 
 I am not sure why you have forwarded this e-mail request on to me.
 
 Please explain.

 Hi Tana -
 
 We are trying to put in place an ISDA Master Agreement between Enron 
 Australia Finance Pty Ltd and Enron Capital & Trade Resources International 
 Corp (Singapore Branch).    Enron Australia has already signed on the 
 document. Can we send it to you to help us get the necessary signatures for 
 ECTRIC (Singapore Branch)?
 
 I have prepared the following documents but not sure if they are most up to 
 date:
 
 1. Certificate of Assistant Secretary
 
 2. Certificate of Secretary
 
 3. Unanimous Consent of Directors (this is incomplete cos I am not sure of 
 the part starting from RESOLVED ..)
 
 
 Is there any other documents that I have missed out?  Would appreciate your 
 help and guidance whether I have done the above correctly.  If there is 
 anything incorrect, please guide me accordingly.
 
 
 
 
 
 Many thanks
 Angie
