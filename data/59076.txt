 Mr. Kean:
 
 I am contacting you on behalf of Susan Henson at Continental Airlines.  We
 are attempting to put in place a data base for future golfing events.  If
 you would please provide us with your Golfing handicap and Shirt size.  If
 you have any questions, please do not hesitate in contacting me at the
