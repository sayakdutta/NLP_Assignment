 Attached please find a clean copy of the ABB Transformer Purchase and Sale 
 Agreement as well as a blackline to show changes made from the WESTLB/ABB 
 Agreement.  Sorry for the delay in getting this to you. We have had to delete

 timely fashion.  A completed version will be forthcoming sometime tomorrow.
 
 If you have any questions or comments, please contact me at (202) 662-2780.
