 They will be ramping up starting hour ending 7 for the following:
 
 He7,8  - 30mw's
 He 9  - 100
 HE 10 - 200
 HE 11 -280
 
 So,  basically,  they will be dragging significantly for these hours.    We sold this imbalance to them for $20 and we will take the floating price.
 The Resource Plan will only show 340 mw's onpeak.     
 
 Ercot will call and ask about our ACE issue.    Just say that our unit is just now coming up and we are on the normal ascension ramp mentioned above.
 
 
 Thanks,
