 The following are some PEP stats on number of meetings at year end vs. mid year 2001; number of feedbacks completed between those two periods; average user session length, and average length of PRC (only at mid year 2001 -- we do not have a comparison on this with year end).  
  
 Hope these are of interest to you.

 Gina
