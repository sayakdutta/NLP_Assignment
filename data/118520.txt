 I should have the amendment completed by end of next week.  I had a 
 conversation with Mike Beebe, President CSC Energy Services, earlier today, 
 and the only issue they have with the attached amendment (I am forwarding you 
 the amendments under separate cover) is the changes to the termination on a 
 change of control by CSC.  I don't think there will be any additional room 
 for further changes, but we have incorporated the majority of changes 
 requested by the monetization team.
 
 Call me with questions/concerns.

 Jimmie -- we are proceeding with the securitization.  Wanted to get an update 
 on the Amendment.  
 
 (1) How far along are you with CSC?  Has CSC signed-off on the draft ?
 (2) Will the Amendment be executed by year-end?
 (3) Is it likely that the termination payment amount (for the Premium Payment 
 tranche) stay as it is currently drafted?
 (4) Do we or the banks have any room to suggest changes?
 
 
 Please let us know how we can help.   Thanks.....Scott  (3-7661)
