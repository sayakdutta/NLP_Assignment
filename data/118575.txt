 
 This will summarize our conversation this morning in which you asked if there 
 was a problem with your purchase of an equity investment (through a private 
 placement) in an internet/communications company.  My response was that Enron 
 prohibits the trading by employees of (i) any security on the Restricted List 
 maintained by the Compliance Group, (ii) any security, instrument or 
 commodity within that employees area of responsibility and (iii) any energy 
 commodity.  I suggested that you contact Donna Lowry to confirm both my 
 understanding and that the security in question is not on teh Restricted List.
 
 While I did not mention it on the phone, I should point out that it would be 
 unwise to take a position in a competitor of Enron's that would (or might in 
 the future) give you control or the appearance of control or influence over 
 the management of that competitor.
