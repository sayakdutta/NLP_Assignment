 amended a clause which states the ENA will keep whole Patina for those 
 obligations and liabilities.

 I agree . . . if Kern remains stubborn, is there any short, sweet side 
 agreement that could be drafted between ENA and Patina (maybe as an add-on to 
 our letter agreement amendment) that would effectively pass through the 
 pre-assignment liabilities?
 
 I just received Chris Kennedy's marked up version.  I will forward 
 immediately.

 You can direct Kern that we are prepared to underpin that exposure such that 
 Enron wears that risk.... as
  1. there should be no risk anyways, and 
 2.  if there were to be any, it should be ENA's anyways.
