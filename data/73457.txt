 Fred / Kay:
 
 I spoke to Duran this morning, and he and I would like to meet together with 
 us to discuss the Midway project and whether or not we will be able to 
 utilize TurboPark Phase 2. I previously told him that because of timing 
 considerations and because there may be certain agreements that will be 
 difficult to make TurboPark compliant (such as the attached interconnect 
 agreement from FPL), that Phase 2 may not be practical for purposes of this 
 project.
 
 I think this would be a good discussion to have on Friday, because we should 
 have more information on the GE7FAs and should have already spoken with TECO 
 on their proposed MOU (and maybe even the tolling agreement). What are your 
 schedules on Friday?
 
 I also would like to schedule a call for tomorrow with TECO to go over the 
 MOU. Fred - Please coordinate with Kay and schedule something with Becky 
 Alex. I would prefer the afternoon if that's OK with you guys, and would like 
 45 min. before the call for us to meet seperately. Also Fred, please advise 
 on the status of the tolling agreement.
 
 Kay - attached is FPL's standard form interconnect agreement. I was thinking 
 that Carlos would be a good choice to review it as he is currently working 
 with accounting / finance on an Ameren interconnect, so he will already be 
 familiar with the likely issues. Please let me know what you think. It will 
 be important to give Duran a summary of likely accounting / finance issues 
 related to this agreement on Friday. 
 
 Hope you both had good weekends. 
 
 Regards,
 
 Ben
