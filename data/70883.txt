 Volunteers:
 
 Many thanks for volunteering to help with this great cause.  Listed below are 
 the volunteers for the CPS BEAR table for Monday, December 18.  Volunteers 
 please plan to arrive at the CPS BEAR (Be A Resource) table in the lobby of 
 the Enron building which will be located by the down escalator.  We will need 
 to have the table staffed from 10 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.  You will be collecting 
 cash contributions for the Children's Protective Services BEAR program.  
 Enron employees will receive a $10 coupon from Sun & Ski Sports for any cash 
 contribution.
