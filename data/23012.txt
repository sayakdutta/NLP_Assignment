 Please see message below as sent to Barbara Hankins yesterday.  If you could let me know whether or not you have signed the documents yet, David Gonzalez at this office is anxious to know where the docs are.
 
 Many thanks.
 
 Kind regards.
 
 
  
     
 
 Have you received in the last week or so Power of Attorney docs to be signed by James Vinson Derrick Jnr.
 
 If yes, could you give me an update as to their status and whether or not they are on their way back to London.
 
 Many thanks.
 
 Kind regards.
