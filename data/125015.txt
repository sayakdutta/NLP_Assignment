 Go ahead and order everyone in the group who wants them the new phones.  Those Eriksons are constantly breaking down.  Let's get ahead of this curve.

 Very well done Jill.
 
  
     
 I called and put in the order for your headset.  I told them to send it ASAP.  
 
 I also called about the little wall problem.  Maintenance is putting in an order
 for someone to come fix it after hours.  
 
 Thanks, Jill
