 For tonight,   Frontera is long 85mw's hour ending 2300.    We need to sell this under the Teco Services book.
 
 
 For tomorrow Frontera needs to sell:
 
 hour ending  4 - 30 mw's
 hour ending 5 -30 mw's
 Enter a purchase from Frontera (Teco services book) enter the same price as you sold for.
 Enter the sale (Teco Services).
 
 I am also selling Frontera 200 mw's for hour ending 7 and 50 mw's hour ending 8.
 I am selling this position for $26.04.       I will be short the Imbalance price during this time. 
 If you can buy below $26.04 for this time period,  do so and schedule to load  in the South.       
 
 I am long into the North Zone as follows :
 he 1-6,    40 mw's
 he 23&24,   55mw's
 
 I am long under deal #834600
 If prices appear to weaken,  sell these mw's for 1-6 and cut this Ercot Imbalance deal by same.    This deals should be listed under Ercot Asset.
 
 
 Thanks,
 JMF
