 
 As an update, it is my understanding negotiations are still on going 
 regarding Connective's Guaranty to Enron.
 
 Please let me know if my information is incorrect.  If acceptable to you, I 
 will proceed with the changes to the agreement as agreed and forward same to 
 you for final review in anticipation of a draft of the guaranty.
