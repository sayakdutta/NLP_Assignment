 Hey Everybody!
 
 Now that I have had a chance to test remote mail myself I think I can give you the basics and hopefully field your questions.
 
 You can access your Outlook mail from any computer connected to the internet without logging on to any Enron dial-ups or sites.  
        To repeat: You can get to your Outlook mail without connecting to Enron.
 
 On any internet connected computer type mail.enron.com in the address box.
 
 At this point a logon box will appear.  It says, 'Please type your user name and password.'.  This is the exact user name and password 
        you use to logon to your Enron computer.
 
 A Microsoft Outlook Web Access page should open up.  Mine opens directly to my Inbox, yours should too.  If not, one of the shortcuts in 
        the vertical 'tool bar', on the left side of the screen shout be an Inbox icon.  Click on it.      
 
 To see your folders you will need to click on the word 'Folders' on the left side, vertical 'tool bar'.
 
 Please try this at work so I can help answer your questions and concerns before you are out and about trying this new system.
 
 Note: When accessing email through the internet you will not have a spell check option.  Your best bet is to copy/paste the email 
                  to a word or excel sheet and spell check it there.  Then make the necessary adjustments in your email before sending.
 
 Please contact me with any questions you have, or if you need help logging on.
