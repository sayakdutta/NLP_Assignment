Due to legal problems with killing or adjusting EOL tickets, I entered a sale (#705989) to balance the volume and price out.  The two deals should be netted.  We should not have paid the purchase at 5.10.

 We invoiced Mirant Americas for deal 705989 and they do not see the deal in their system.  It was for 5,000/day from 4/1 - 4/2 at 5.10 on PG&E Texas.  Can you tell me who you did this deal with at Mirant?
