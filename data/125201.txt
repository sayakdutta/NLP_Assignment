 
 So Camas Jr is confirmed paper mill?
 Do you know what is behind the Bellingham II point (290)?
 Bellingham/Ferndale (472) I understand is the Ferndale power plant; is this 290 point
 another unit?
 Thanks,
 Jason
 
  
     
 That's where the James River Paper Mill is I think... I'll check it out
 
  
     
 Dave,
 
 What do you know about the NWPL meter 300 (Camas Jr.)? It makes up a fair amount of Portland area load.
 It's my understanding that this is industrial, possibly paper mills, but I don't have much more info yet.
 If this is a customer you are familiar with, let me know.
 
 Thanks,
 Jason
