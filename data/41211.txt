 
 We have been advised by Mary Kay Lemont that Bear Stearns will not open this new account until they have all corporate documentation in place.  ECT Europe Finance, Inc. does not have resolutions authorizing the opening of brokerage accounts, so we are currently preparing corporate resolutions to circulate for signature.
 
 Will the authorized traders in this account be those authorized to trade on Enron Credit's behalf?  If so, will you provide me with a current list?
 
 Additionally, is this the only position that will be in this account?
 
 Thanks!
 
 Marie
