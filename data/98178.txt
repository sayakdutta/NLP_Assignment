 The employee in question in Bill's e-mail is Harry Moulton.  Harry is an 
 employee of EECC's construction subsidiary, NEPCO.  Harry was in Korea to 
 survey the machines at the Kunsan site.  Harry is currently the NEPCO site 
 manager for the construction of a sixth unit at East Coast Power's Linded 
 project (Enron owns 25%).  As far as the depositions go, it would certainly 
 be better if Bob and I could do them back-to back, but that is a lawyer vs 
 lawyer issue, let us know.
