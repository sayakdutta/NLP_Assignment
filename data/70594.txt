 
 Chris,
 
 We won't have any site specific technical info, so we will  have to fly 
 without it.  I know that seems strange, but there is no designated site for 
 this equipment as of now.
 
 Here's co#1:
 
 
 
 Each of these units has one dual fuel option.
 
 The master list of serial numbers is in this document:
 
 
 
 
 We use the unit serial numbers as opposed to turbine or generator serial 
 numbers.  I'm sending you the whole enchilada since this is a handy reference.
 
 I agree with adding 25% of the cost of the dual fuel option to the January 
 payment.  Unit 17  to company 1 is fine.  The maximum liability price (or 
 whatever we call it) will be the base price allocation, plus the dual fuel 
 option amount.
 
 Good question on the retention.  I guess we should set it up as if each is in 
 a stand alone project. As far as I know they may be intending to put these at 
 separate sites.
 
 I'll get back to you on the fax and contract reference number.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
