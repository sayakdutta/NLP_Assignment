 It looks like Randy is invited but the rest of South America is not on this 
 list.  Should she check with John Novak to see if the South American 
 Attorneys are invited?

 Sorry to bother you with this, but given the new situation, do you think I am 
 required to attend this meeting or is it a mailing error.  Thanks.
