 
 FYI-attached is my list of notes on online approvals, which includes the 
 South American countries we currently trade with.
 
 Justy-if you have any updates to the European countries, they would be most 
 appreciated.  I have had no updates since Edmund fell ill.

 Justin:
 
  I am the "new" lawyer in charge of our financial trading operations in 
 Mexico.
 
 I am told that we do not trade financial with any Mexican counterparty 
 without going through our normal due diligence process.  At the end of the 
 day we need a Master in place with any Mexican counterparty with whom we 
 trade (financial) online or otherwise.  I checked and we do not have a Master 
 in place with this counterparty.
