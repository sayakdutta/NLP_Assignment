 Please be advised that Sue and Mona both have now been migrated to "Corp" and 
 therefore, any e-mail sent to them should read "Susan J Mara/NA/Enron" and 
 "Mona L Petrochko/NA/Enron", respectively.  
 
 Please also note that anything addressed to their old "EES" addresses will 
 NOT reach the addressee!
 
 Thanks,
 Joseph
