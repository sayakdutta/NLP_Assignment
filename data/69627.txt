 
 I'm looking forward to Saturday, thanks for inviting me!  Since you don't want to be the first person at the party you can kill time by giving me a tour of your house.  I printed the email that has all the information, so I'll plan on calling you sometime Saturday and then meeting you at your house at 5:00.  Let's talk Saturday, here's my home phone number (303) 469-6768, and my cell (303) 810-5708.  Should we bring anything?
 
 
     
 
 5:00 would be just fine.....I don't like being the 1st person to show 
 up at a party anyways!!  It should be alot of fun....they are fun 
 group of people.
