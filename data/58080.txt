 talk before you left.  But, I'm still here; give me a call when you get a 
 chance - 1586.

 I just wanted to send you a quick note to let you know that I'm outta here!
 
 Today is my last day in the office here at Azurix, and in the coming months, 
 I will start in a new position as SVP in the LNG development group at El Paso 
 Energy.  This happened very quickly, and I wanted to make sure that I let 
 everyone know before I left.
 
 I don't have any contact information yet for my new job, but if you want to 

 
 I enjoyed working with all of you during the past five years at Enron / 
 Azurix, and I wish you all of the best.
 
 Take care.

 PS -- There is a happy hour tonight at Scudeiros on Dallas Street (just west 
 of the Met Garage) beginning around 5:00.  If you can make it, please come!
