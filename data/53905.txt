 
 Hi, Christe
 
 Thanks. The objective of the meeting with Jeff Shankman is to use his powers 
 of persuasion
 to make sure that John Arnold and Louise Kitchen can make   presentations to 
 the Tiger
 Team. We can also talk to them  about getting some other people from their 
 units to make presentations 
 to the team.
