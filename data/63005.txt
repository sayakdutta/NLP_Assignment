 
 Jane,
 
 I have printed off these forms, had John sign the employee one and have 
 passed this information on to Dave Delainey.  After receiving the 
 information, please let me know if you have any questions or require any 
 additional information.
 
 Thanks

 As requested.   The supervisor form should be signed by Delaney and I will 
 get David to sign.  Please complete to the best of your ability.  If anything 
 is missing, we can follow-up with HR.
 
 
  
 
 Jane
