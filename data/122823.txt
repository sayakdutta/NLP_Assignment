 
 Bill,
 
 I enjoyed talking with you about our potential software needs.  It sounds 
 like you may have something to offer in which we are interested, and we are 
 looking forward to a visit from you or one of your representatives in early 
 January.   If you want to contact me, I can be reached at 713-345-7229 or by 
 reply to this E-mail.
 
 
 Thank You,
 
 Charlie Weldon
