 I have checked the Outlook system for your availability today to try and set a meeting time today with Eric regarding the memo he sent on Friday.  It appears that each of you is available between 11:30 and 2:30 today to meet for 45 minutes to 1 hour.  I would suggest that we schedule this meeting for 1:00 p.m. today, Monday, January 28.  Please respond that you can attend or suggest another time today.
 
 Thank you.
