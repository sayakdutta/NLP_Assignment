 
 Rick,
 
 Attached for your information and input is a copy of a presentation I am 
 putting together for EGM.  I would appreciate your comments on the 
 presentation but especially need your input on your section.  The LNG page is 
 on page 6 and needs some work.  there is also a typo.  On the graph, we need 
 to find a way to illustrate our business graphically, what do you think?
  I would appreciate a quick turnaround of your initial changes.  After we 
 complete this first draft, this will be a continuous work in progress.
 Thanks,
 Mike
