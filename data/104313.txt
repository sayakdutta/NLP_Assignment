 Jim Kopley with LIMITrader informed me that they have no objection to many of 
 the changes you suggested to the LIMITrader agreement, and he is confident 
 that he can address, to our satisfaction, the other concerns we raised.   Jim 
 encouraged you to call him at 212-499-2909 to discuss.  
 
 The only exception Jim noted related to our confidentiality issue, which Jim 
 forwarded to their attorney.
