 Do you see any rationale to pay for this?  Mark

 Mark,
 
  Thanks for looking into the People's to People program for me.    Instead of 
 asking Cliff for full funding perhaps it would be "better received" to 
 suggest 50% funding?   If it doesn't look like that would work either, would 
 it be ok with Enron's policy to go on my own?
 
  Thanks.  (I hope that I'm not being a nuisance about this Mark, if so, just 
 say the word and I'll drop it!)
 
  Monica
