 Please don't tell me that you've spent the last hour trying to think of that

 Water is just as liquid as gas.  So to speak.
 
 
    
  
 Doesn't say, other than go private.  So I guess that means, this first step 
 is trying to ease whatever pain can be eased in the investment community that 
 bought into Azurix since a drop from $19 to $7 is better than $19 to $4, and 
 then Azurix will sell itself out of business (I told you about the calls from 
 Argentine and Mexican counsel on wanting to represent potential buyers of 
 Azurix assets in those countries).  I don't know about any other strategies, 
 can you trade water?
