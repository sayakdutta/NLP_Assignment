 
 Hi there!  I was not able to launch the photo but was able to see it in 
 "View" mode on my Lotus Notes.  What a pretty girl!
 
 I assume you'll be in Austin for Mother's Day?  Let me know.  I was thinking 
 of cooking brunch if the whole gang is going to be there, but if it is just 
 me and Mum maybe we'll just go out.  I have no idea what to buy her!  must do 
 some shopping today or tomorrow.
 
 Trivia time:  last night I went to the Astros game with some people from 
 work.  One guy brought his girlfriend, Thani-ta, who is from Thailand.  She 
 likes to eat at Nit Noi when she is in town!  She told me she has a dog 
 called Nit Noi, which means "little bit."  Now you know!
 
 Have a good day; hope to see you in Austin.
 
 Love,
 proud auntie sooz
 
 
 
 

   
  
 
 Hi! I sent a picture of Grayson to multiple people including you. I have
 never done a mass mailing before and not sure if i did it right. Please let
 me know if you received it! If not I will try again! If you DID get it, let
 me know if you have any problems opening it. I hope you had a good trip and
 hope to see you in Austin for Mother's Day!
 
 Byeee!
 Karin
