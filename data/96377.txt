 
 Can you met with Ella's school sometime mid morning on either Wed or Thurs 
 next week.
 
 On Colorado, we currently are scheduled to return on Wed the 22nd.  On this 
 schedule we would miss parent orientation (Tues) and the kids would miss the 
 first day of school which is a half day (Wed). Reschedule?
