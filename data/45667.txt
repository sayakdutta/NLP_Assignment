 
 FYI,
 
 I have a database where I keep track of my online approvals/declines and 
 reasons why (if there are any!).  I don't know to what extent Frank ever 
 looked at it, but you might find it helpful.  It is called "ENA Legal Online 
 Trading Agreements" database.  If you're interested, I'll ask Mike Neves to 
 get you access.
