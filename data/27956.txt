 Attached is a brief overview of the proposed TW Pilot Program for 20/d of 
 firm capacity using EnronOnline as the Internet Tool.  This is the 
 information that Steve Harris has been working on.  Unfortunately, Steve 
 Hotte and I have a conflict with the meeting you scheduled on Thursday May 4 
 at 1:00.
 
 Let me know if you have any questions.
 
 Thank you,
 Ricki Winters for Julia White
