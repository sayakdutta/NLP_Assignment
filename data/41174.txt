 
 You should have received a fax from me by now.  Have you not received it?
 
  
     
 Not a problem at all.  I guess I will wait for your group to produce a list.
 
 Thanks,

 Tom:
 
 You can only see the master agreement database.  The brokerage agreement database is separate and cannot be viewed by anyone outside Legal.  The Bear Stearns agreement you see listed is there in error.  It should be in the brokerage agreement database.  We do have listings for Morgan and Goldman.  Sara wasn't aware that you couldn't see this database when you spoke,

 I have gone through the database and have only been able to find the Bear Prime Broker agreement under ECI.  I know I have a Morgan ECI account and should have a Goldman pending.  I am looking for Enron Co=Enron Credit Inc. is that not correct?
 
 Please advise.
 
 Thanks,
