 I would very much like to attend but have a meeting scheduled that day with 
 Chris Calger (ENA) and the CEO and CFO of Sempra Energy (we're trying to do a 
 deal with them).   That's a date that I can't change.  I can meet on Nov. 
 3rd, or Nov. 7-9.  Hope it's possible to re-arrange
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Jeff and Mike,
 
 Our first meeting has been scheduled to take place on November 2nd.  The 
 meeting will probably last half a day and will begin around 1pm.  Please let 
 me if you plan to attend.  Thanks and have a great weekend.
 
 Regards,
 Lara
