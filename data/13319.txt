 2000 EEO-1 Surveys Deadline Extended
 September 25, 2000
 
 
 The Joint Reporting Commission  of the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
 Commission (EEOC) has extended the deadline for employers to file their
 2000 EEO-1 Surveys from September 30, 2000 to October 30, 2000. Private
 employers with 100 or more employees and federal contractors with 50 or
 more employees and contracts of $50,000 or more, are required to file
 an EEO-1 report.
 The EEOC has recently completed its mail-out of EEO-1 forms, so keep checking
 your mail - it should be on its way!  If October 15th rolls around and
 you have not yet received your survey, you may call the Joint Reporting
 Committee at (757) 461-1213, or log on to www.mimdms.com, to request a
 copy.
