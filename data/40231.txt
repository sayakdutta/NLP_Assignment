 I've attached an electronic copy of the complaint, which has been filed 
 within the past hour.  Hard copies that also include the cover letter, Fed. 
 Reg. notice, and Appendix for service list are being mailed to all persons on 
 FERC's service list in EL00-95-000 (the San Diego complaint proceeding).
 
 Thanks to all who contributed to this project; it was truly a group effort.  
 And special thanks to the nine companies that agree to join as signatories.
 
 For those companies that did not join in, we encourage you to intervene ASAP 
 in support of the complaint, including the request for an immediate 
 suspension of the chargeback before the next round of chargeback invoices 
 come due (which we believe could be as early as Feb. 15).  Since we are 
 asking FERC to suspend the chargeback no later than Feb. 14, your immediate 
 intervention would be very helpful.
 
 Thanks again.  Ron
