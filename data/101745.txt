 
 You are absolutely the BEST Tobin...
 
 I think I'm flying back up to Seattle next weekend to have a second-round interview with Cascade.  However, I must admit I'm intrigued by you and your father's very diverse connections in that area of the country.  Hope you are doing well and that Merry Old England is treating you properly.  
 
 No rush on getting back to me, I just wanted to make sure you received the email and had whatever answers I had to give.
 
 BTW....I'm celebrating my first quarter century today!  Quite a milestone in one's life.  I have to love that I'm essentially unemployed and living with my parents.  Big pat on the back for that one. Ha.
 
 Ciao,
 Susan
 
 Question:  Do you think you will return to the PNW when you finish with school...we hadn't really talked about your future plans and my curiosity is peaked.
 
  
     
 Susan:
 I have your email! Sorry I have not responded. Alas, you are not forgotten
 however. I called my dad and a few others and they have promised to get back
 to me shortly. I will write more thoroughly tomorrow. Hope you are well....
 Best,
 Tobin
