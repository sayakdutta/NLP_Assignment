 Sorry for the delay, I've been away from the office sick.  
 
 In response to your note:
 
 UK = fine
 Sweden = fine  (need to check the authority of persons executing PAs and ETAs)
 France = fine.  Need to check on the type of entity to ensure close-out 
 netting is possible
 Italy = restricted at the moment.  We have sought further advice.  Will 
 update in due course.
 Netherlands = swaps only at the moment for financials.  This may change.
 
 We have not done any due diligence for physical transactions, so the above 
 only relates to cash settled commodity derivatives.

 I've got  several European counterparties on my 8/3/00 ClickPaper Online 
 List, the UK, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and France.  Are there any 
 restrictions on trading financial pulp & paper in Europe?
 
 Everything going well...?
