 Did you read Molly Ivins wonderful column last week in which she says exactly 
 why she is voting for Nader and we should vote for Gore??

 Of course, I will be hurt and disappointed if the Sellers family doesn't 
 vote its conscious, doesn't vote for the candidate that truly represents 
 the values that the Sellers family stands for.  That candidate is, of 
 course, Ralph Nadar. 
 Amen,

 P.S. Rory and Timi love Dr. Laura.

 This is a letter to the editor that appeared in the Cleveland Plain Dealer. 
 This is the letter in its entirety. 
 For those in need of a reason to vote on November 7, here are two: 
 1.      Because Matthew Shepard cannot. 
 2.      Because Dr. Laura can.
