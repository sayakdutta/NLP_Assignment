 We will dig into this but it could take a week or two.
  
 I believe that Rogers might have nailed the oil situation.
  
 We will start gathering what the loads were as they surface to see what areas have seen new peaks. We will also watch for NERC releases and Regional releases that we get as part of the Control Area dat flow.
  
 Thanks.

 Lloyd, 
 
 I was just thinking about some of the record peak demand levels set at some of the Midwest utilities despite less than record temps and slowing economic activity, and the resiliancy of the crude oil market to decline in the face of a slowing world economy.  My conspiracy theory...could the U.S. government be secretly building up military arms and parts at factories in the Midwest and other regions of the country, and if so, couldn't that help explain these records?  It's kind of a crazy thought, but I'd like to explore it fundamentally (do we know the locations of certain plants that might engage in these types of activities, how much power they could consume if called upon to expand production of military goods, etc.)  I talked to Rogers about it and he threw a buildup of the strategic petroleum reserve into the theory to help explain crude oil support in the face of a crashing world economy.  Let me know what you guys think...
