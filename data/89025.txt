 Anthony, 
 
 Please contact Keith Ford at TXU Fuel and give him the info he needs to prepare a contract with ENA (Tax ID, payment info, etc.).  We need this to be effective June 1, 2001.  If you are not the correct person to handle this, please forward to the appropriate person.  Thanks.

 At the request of Lynn Handlin, please find attached a copy of the following:
    GISB contract form
    Special Provisions for intrastate gas
    Special Provision for interstate gas
 
 Please review, and if interested in putting these contracts in place, forward to
 me all required information on the first page of the GISB contract form. I will
 then have the contracts prepared and forwarded to you for execution.
 
 Please keep in mind that TXU Fuel Company is an intrastate pipeline and can
 purchase interstate gas only under certain limited conditions. These conditions
 are covered under item number 8 in the Special Provisions. Thanks.
 
 Keith Ford
 TXU Fuel Company
 Contract Administration Supervisor
