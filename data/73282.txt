 me you would just go ahead and do it.  I'll just tell her it isnt' ready. It 
 doesn't matter to me.

 I asked you yesterday when you needed these binders.  It's a good thing I had 
 them almost done.  I would appreciate it in the future if you would give me a 
 heads up on what is happening.  This morning Dan, Sheila and you are all 
 needing things, and I'm only one person.

 There is a 130 phone call today regarding the stuff you are putting together 
 re GE.  It would be helpful if it was ready a couple of hours in advance.
 
 Thanks,
