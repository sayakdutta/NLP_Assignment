 Please plan on attending our next Credit/Legal seminar.  This seminar will be 
 held Wednesday, May 23rd, from 2:00 - 3:30 p.m. in EB49c4 and will be a 
 continuation of our discussions of the ISDA Master Agreement.  The topic for 
 this session will be to first finish the last few items on the Credit Support 
 Annex, then discuss the Credit Worksheet and High Risk Counterparties.  
 Refreshments will be provided.  Please e-mail Becky Spencer, if you are 
 unable to attend.
