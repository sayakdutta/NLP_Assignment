 What are Tracy's thoughts on this?

 This is a procedure that we received from the CAISO via WPTF and Sue Mara.  It is a draft.
 
 It fits with a more formal procedure posted last friday but shows some detail on what parties consuming R/T energy will be charged. Basically they will be charged a combiniation of the MCP and OOM costs.
 
 Note that CERS pays OOM suppliers on a bilateral basis within 20-30 days.  Sounds like a good market to sell to while it lasts.
