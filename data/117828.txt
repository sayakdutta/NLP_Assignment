 
 Just a quick note to give you as much warning as possible.  The next phase of 
 the office construction process will begin in just over a week.  That means 
 it is finally time to move into your new offices.  Taffy Milligan will be 
 submitting the move request (for next Friday - Jan. 12) and will have details 
 directly.  Your assistants can help you order boxes and arrange your move.
