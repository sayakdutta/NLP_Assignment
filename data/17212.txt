 
 Thanks, Roger.  We'll need to determine whether we've turned the customer 
 back.  Any help that you and Catherine can give in that regard is 
 appreciated.  Then we can decide if, and how, we choose to respond to the PUC 
 staffer.  Thanks very much for your help.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 On or about Oct .17th I returned a call to  Kathy Pantolo (sp) at 
 818-846-8141 X 506 (according to my phone log).  As I recall the reason for 
 her 
 calling the office was that the Sept. invoice had just arrived and she 
 questioned NGI price. The scope of our conversation was limited to gas
  prices and how high they were, this is the only conversation I can recall 
 having with Providence Hospital ...
    
 I hope this sheds a little more light on this issue.
 Roger
