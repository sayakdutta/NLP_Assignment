 I guess I think that it is not worth the fight these days.  I suppose would approve this training, but I think we need to have an understanding w/ Ogletree about travel time, travel expenses, billing rates, etc.  They need to understand who holds the purse strings, and I do not think it would be appropriate for them to bill their full hourly rate for time spent on travel given that we could find someone local to do the same training -- or could send me or Lizzette to do it for the cost of travel only.    For your information, David, there is nothing magic about the training they are doing.  It is standard training that I used to deliver frequently when I was in private practice.  Ogletree does not have a monopoly on it.
 
 I'll try to call you early this week, now that the other work I have been focusing on may slow down a bit.

 Michelle, Here's the training the NEPCO HR group has on their schedule.  I
 think the outcome of your meeting with Indivero and Schwartzenburg is that
 Mike would forward through me all requests involving the retention of
 outside counsel including the expected training needs from outside counsel.
 Let me know if you have any comments or suggestions.  Thanks.
