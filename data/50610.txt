 your help with interviews!

 Beth,
 
 Please, let me know about Friday night. I want to know if I should
 dress up for dinner. I am very busy and I would be glad to skip dinner
 if you have  enough people to cover it.

 Thank you for volunteering to interview this Super Saturday, June 3rd.  We 
 are working on the interview schedule and you will be receiving an interview 
 packet no later than Friday morning.  Please let us know as soon as possible 
 if you have any conflicts and will not be able to participate.
 
 We appreciate your support of the Associate/Analyst Program.
