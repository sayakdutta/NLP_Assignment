 I just spoke to Sara Shackleton and she approved opening FPL for all 
 financial trading.  She has also been discussing the utilities with outside 
 counsel and we may be able to open more up for trading.  She is going to 
 bring a copy of my list to the Legal Conference and review it, so hopefully 
 we'll have some more changes for you next week.
