 
 Janet,
 
 Unfortunately, the confidentiality provisions contained in this agreement do not allow us to provide copies of the agreement to affiliates.  We will need the permission of Merita before I can provide a copy to you.
 
  
     
 
 Dear Tana
 Please could you provide me with a copy of the ISDA in place between Nordea Bank (previously Merita) and ENA.
 Many thanks
 Janet
  
     
 Can one of you guys have a look into the ISDA situation with Nordea Bank (formerly Merita). They had an ISDA with ENA but I believe that we are in the process of transfering it to ECTRIC.
 
 A progress report would be appreciated.
 
 Cheers
 
 Darren
