 Some friends of my wife and I are throwing a little bash on the evening of 
 September 9th for my upcoming baby BOY.   I would like to invite you all to 
 attend.  I believe there will be a margarita machine....
 
 If you want to come,, please reply by sending me your address.  You will then 
 recieve an invitation by mail.
 
 Hope to see you there,,
 
 Mike
