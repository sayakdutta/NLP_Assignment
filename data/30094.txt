 Randy,
 
 Here are the instructions for the TS update.  I just ran it here on my pc and 
 everything works fine.
 
 1. go to http:\\remoteservices.enron.com
 2. click here
 3. save program to c:\
 4. double click on citrixclient.exe after it has been downloaded.
 
 This will add a Terminal Server icon to the desktop.  Double click on this to 
 launch the new version of TS.
 
 Thanks,
 KG
