 
 If we both agree that the counterparty should now be RAG Coal Sales of 
 America, shouldn't your spreadsheet reflect that name?  I'm confused.

 GCP does have the correct name on file. The company changed its name from 
 Cyprus Amax Coal Corporation to RAG American Coal Sales Company and then to 
 RAG Coal Sales of America. I had talked to the legal when I first found out 
 and provided Cheryl Johnson in Global SAP, with all the name change 
 documents. You may contact her at x33103 in order to request 
 those........................Adnan
 
 
 
     
 Can you check on the name of RAG American Coal Sales Company.  We have a note 
 in our Financial Trading Agreement database that pursuant to a Certificate of 
 Amendment filed with the Delaware Secretary of State, RAG American Coal Sales 
 Company further changed its name to RAG Coal Sales of America, Inc. on 
 4/6/2000.  Our file is missing so I cannot find the hard copy of the name 
 change.  Thanks.
