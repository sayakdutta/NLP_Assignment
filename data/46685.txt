 Attached for your review and comment please find the form of NDA that we 
 intend to send to FLAG Telecom as soon as possible.  The attached is the same 
 form as the Level 3 NDA distributed last week.
 
 As we would like to send this out as early as possible, please call me at 
 X54482 if you have any questions or comments.
 
 Thank you,
 
 Peter Feltman
