 Beth,
 
 Given our conversation two weeks ago, I want to keep the ball rolling at light speed.  Therefore, I would like to get together to walk through the action plan for the following:
 
 Tariff - Flash to Actual
 Intra-desk Settlements
 Daily Tariff P/L
 Update the wholesale equivalents to retail generation positions
 Daily Price Curve changes by rate schedule
 Daily P/L by utility rate schedule
 
 
 I will ask my assistant to set-up this meeting for early next week.
 
 Thanks
 
 Jay
