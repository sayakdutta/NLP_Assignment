 
 I was reviewing the pictures you sent.  You are not only an adventuress but 
 also a Goddess.  Happy Valentines day.
 
 I turned Pete down on the offer to stay.  I guess I'm just ready to move on 
 and this feels pretty dead end here.  But I'll try and catch up with you from 
 time to time if I can.
