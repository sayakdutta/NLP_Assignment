 
 George,
 
 We shall be able to accommodate one or two extra people
 in the first round.
 
 We shall be glad to repeat the seminars starting soon for a 
 bigger group. We would like to learn form experience how to run
 it.
 
 By the way, we had an option training for EES (roughly 150 people,
 over a few weeks). I can give you the materials and
 we can repeat it if you think it's useful.

 Vince - I had heard about this derivatives class from Clayton
 and I am inquiring about the possibility of someone outside 
 of the Research Group being able to attend.  If so, I would
 like the opportunity.  Let me know if it is possible.
 
 Thanks,
 George
