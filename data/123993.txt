 I just wanted to give you an up date on the review with Heather. My primary=
  focus with her was taking on to much responsibility and not focusing enoug=
 h on the end results of her project such as Renewables. She just needs to s=
 pend more time ensuring that the numbers being reported are correct and acc=
 urate the first time, not after it goes into production. There had also bee=
 n a complaint from Fran that Heather is not involved enough with the daily =
 routines and may be taking the group for granted when it comes to the day t=
 o day work. Heather agreed with that but the problem that she faces is that=
  Nick, Fran and Sam use that inter messaging system to communicate instead =
 of verbally and as a result Heather is left out. I was thinking of telling =
 everyone that there should be no use of the messaging system for business r=
 elated issues within our group and also implementing the assigning of respo=
 nsibilities to people for a couple of weeks then rotating it around. That w=
 ay nobody can say somebody else is not helping enough. All in all it went w=
 ell otherwise. She is was very receptive to my concerns and readily admitte=
 d to areas of improvement.
 
 Couple of other things that I got from the meetings that might help the gro=
 up. The first is an informational meeting with settlements and maybe accoun=
 ting to understand what they do with the reports that we send each month an=
 d secondly, another meeting (hopefully better) regarding VaR and how the re=
 ports that we produce are used.
