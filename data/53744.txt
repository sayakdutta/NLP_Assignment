 It sounds very interesting. I forwarded your messages
 to two members of my group who work on the problems related
 to transmission (a key to the power markets successful
 growth).
 
 I shall share with you their  reaction.
 
 I hope everything is going well.

 Dear Vince,
 
 Greetings from Boston... In the last year, I've been associated with the
 Neptune merchant transmission project... check it out at www.NeptuneRTS.com.
 We filed with FERC last week and I'm sending you the Wall Street Journal and
 Megawatt Daily articles on it.
 
 Have you seen any good analytical work on merchant transmission? I'm in a
 dialogue with Paul Joskow and others on this issue but as always would
 appreciate your thoughts.
 
 All the best,
 
 Ed
