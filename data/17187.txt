 Jeff,
 
 In light of our conversation about ongoing DA sales, the Theater Owners
 Association of California would like to talk to someone at Enron about
 DA contracts.  The contact is Milton Moritz (President) at (310)
 657-7724 or (310) 652-1093, and his conversation with me should be
 referenced as I know him personally.
 
 Speak to you soon.
 
 Scott
