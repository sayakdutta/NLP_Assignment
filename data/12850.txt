 Greetings from Xcel Energy,
 
 Just a reminder to let you know that there are still hole sponsorships and
 spaces available in the 3rd Annual SPP Energy Traders Golf Tournament to be
 held in Kansas City at the Tiffany Greens Golf Club this September.  Please
 contact me (or Wayne Reed at 303-308-6148) to obtain information regarding
 hole sponsorships - there is a limited number available so the sooner the
 better!
 
 To enter the tournament, just complete the attached entry form and send it
 to either Wayne or myself.
 
 Looking forward to seeing you there!
