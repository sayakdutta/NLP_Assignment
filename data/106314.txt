 All,
 
 There seems to be a lot of confusion, on our ability to trade with Total 
 Intl.  Our London group seems to be able to trade with this counterparty on a 
 regular basis, but I understand, we have a legal issue outstanding with 
 Total.  Could I please have further info on why Houston cannot trade with 
 this counterparty.
 
 Thank you,
 
 Lee Jackson
