 [Arkansas Democrat Gazette]
 
 Two local men were seriously injured when their pickup truck left the road
 and struck a tree near Cotton Patch on State Highway 38 early Monday
 morning.
 
 Woodruff County deputy Dovey Snyder reported the accident shortly after
 midnight Monday.
 
 Thurston Poole, 33, of Des Arc and Billy Ray Wallis, 38, of Little Rock are
 listed in serious condition at Baptist Medical Center. The accident occurred
 as the two men were returning to Des Arc after a frog-gigging trip.
 
 On an overcast Sunday night, Poole's pick-up truck headlights malfunctioned.
 The two men concluded that the headlight fuse on the older model truck had
 burned out. As a replacement fuse was not available, Wallis noticed that the
 .22 caliber bullet from his pistol fit perfectly into the fuse box next to
 the steering wheel column.
 
 After inserting the bullet, the headlights again began to operate properly
 and the two men proceeded toward the White River bridge. After traveling
 about 20 miles and just before crossing the river, the bullet apparently
 overheated, discharged and struck Poole in the right testicle. The vehicle
 swerved sharply right exiting the pavement and striking a tree.
 
 Poole suffered only minor cuts and abrasions from the accident, but will
 require surgery to repair the other wound. Wallis sustained a broken
 clavicle and was treated and released.
 
 "Thank God we weren't on that bridge when Thurston shot his balls off or we
 might both be dead" stated Wallis.
 
 "I've been a trooper for ten years in this part of the world, but this is a
 first for me. I can't believe that those two would admit how this accident
 happened," said Snyder.
 
 Upon being notified of the wreck, Lavinia, Poole's wife asked how many frogs
 the boys had caught and did anyone get them from the truck.
 Way to go, Lavinia)
