 Doug Leach called me about this.  Could one of your guys call this guy and 
 see if there is anything we can do to help him.  He is a friend of Doug's and 
 will give us the business if we are competitive.  Supposedly he has a very 
 favorable fixed price offter from a competitor, so I think it is a fishing 
 expedition.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Tom

 Tom,
 
 I will be out of town until November 8 so if Enron is interested in quoting 
 LSU a ten year physical natural gas price, then please contact Mr. Joe Kelley 

 
 Thanks,
 Doug
