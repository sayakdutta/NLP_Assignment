 I like the sound of the Trifle described in your email to Mark.  I will have 
 extra Sherry on mine.  
 
 How is it going?  I had a great time at the party in Austin and hanging with 
 you at the Brown Bar.  I am not sure what I was thinking toward the end of 
 the evening by mixing Tequila and Cranberry, but I guess you have to get 
 creative when the circumstances require.    I was moving a little slow the 
 next day and drive back to Houston wasn't quite as pleasant.
 
 Did you have a good weekend?  I didn't do anything real exciting for the 
 weekend before Halloween.  Went to a concert that had 4 bands.  One of them 
 is a band from Austin called Vallejo.  Heard of them?  
 
 Now tell me the truth.  Do you really like Yorkshire Pudding?  Drop me a line 
 when you get a chance.
 
 Gerald
