  I have reviewed the marketing materials. In general terms, they are 
 acceptable. I would only include a provision stating that the services would 
 be provided to the extent that no Mexican law or regulation is violated.
 
 Regards

 
 
 Pablo and Jose:
 Thanks for the update.  Based on the marketing information that you received
 from us yesterday, are there any restrictions on our folks in Mexico going
 forward with their marketing efforts?  If so, please advise.  Prior to 
 receiving
 you written advice, would it be possible to schedule a call maybe on Wednesday
 of next week with myself and Jaime so that we can at least outline any 
 potential
 online issues, both in connection with our marketing efforts and in connection
 with the online documents that you are reviewing? I am available anytime after
 2:30 (Houston time) on Wednesday and I am wide open on Thursday.
