 This is my flight and the ticket is in my name. The travel agt said I was
 also a OnePass Elite (#COHG770475) and that there might be an auto upgrade
 two days prior to the flight at no charge.
 
 Just getting out of our Monday meeting. The building has yet to turn on the
 a/c and it's hot in here!
 
 
     
 
 is this your flight?  Have you seen your ticket?  It isn't in my name,  is
 it?
