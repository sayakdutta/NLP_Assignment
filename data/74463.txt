 
 In the interest of moving things forward, it would help if you could provide the following info:
 
 1. Hand-marked copy of the portions of the current contract which need to be changed.
 
 2. A brief description of the new deal, especially the index language.
 
 I know VEPCO may be preparing a first draft, but I think it would be good to get some focus ahead of time.
