 cat - he likes sleeping on my firm, rockhard stomach when I watch TV.
 
 
 
 
 

    
 
 I planted 50 plus flowers this weekend in my flower boxes. They look so
 pretty. I hope I don't kill them. I'm going to find me some kittens in the
 next few weeks. I'm lonely without Miss Muffy. Cindy Vachuska is coming to
 visit me in two weekends. I'm taking May 4th off.. we are going to do some
 museums, day to the eastern shore, and baltimore's inner harbor.
 
 Bidweek is such a joy!!! We are suppose to be back online with y'all... so
 they say.
 
 
     
 
 
 How sweet.  Its doing ok.  A better question is "how's the lovelife?".
 That's doing ok too - although I wish I could find the perfect woman.  Mine
 is wanting to take some trips - Maine, New York, EUROPE!!!!!
 
 What's up with you girl?
