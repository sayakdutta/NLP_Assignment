 
 Jean,  I have reviewed Marathon's revisions to the CA.  I agree that these changes are minor and I am OK with all of them except one.  With respect to the stricken sentence in Paragraph 7, I would ask Marathon the reason for the strike.  I think the sentence only reinforces the right to compete concept in the first sentence and further specify's the concept.  I would be happy to discuss this further with Marathon.  Thanks.

 Gerald,
 
 Please find attached our C.A. with Marathon's modifications.  After receiving appropriate legal examination, I would like to turn around this C.A. A.S.A.P. (i.e., today). 
 
 Best Regards,
 
 Jean

 Jean,
 
 Thanks for your note. Please find attached the CA with some minor
 changes. If acceptable please sign and return two copies for our
 signature. Also on a separate note, we have named a manager to pursue
 this strategy going forward. I would like to introduce you to Walt Madro
 on my return at the end of the week.
 
 Regards
 
 Paul

 Paul,
 
 As promised last week, please find attached to this correspondence a
 draft term sheet which outlines six potential asset management
 outsourcing arrangements.  These various proposal structures signify
 initial steps representing general commercial concepts to be further
 refined by a transaction team.
 
 I know that you are out until Wednesday, but I would be interested in
 the status of the Confidentiality Agreement within Marathon's legal
 department.  
 
 I look forward to hearing from you.
 
 Regards, 
 
 Jean
