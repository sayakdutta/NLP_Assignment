 Greg Couch forwarded your email address to me saying you were interested in some Enron logo sleeves of golf balls.  I have four sleeves of Titleist Tour Prestige 90 and 8 sleeves of Pinnacle Gold Distance golf balls.
 
 Please let me know if you are interested and what you are willing to pay.  I am going to put them on EBay tonight if I do not here from you.  If you are not interested, I apologize for the message.  Thanks
 PL
