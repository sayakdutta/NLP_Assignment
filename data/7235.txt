 
 Sally,
 
 Please let Cynthia know that Sally is out of town recruiting today.  I did 
 speak to someone in her office (I thought it was her assistant) and Bobbie 
 Power a week or two ago to let them know that Sally would not be available on 
 this date.  Sally does, however, want to be a part of this group, so please 
 notify us for the next meeting.
 
 Thanks,
 Patti x39106
 (Sally's assistant)
