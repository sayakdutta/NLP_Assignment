 
 Dee, could you please forward to Steve Van Hooser our usual checklist on 
 employee matters for diligence purposes?  That would be helpful.  Thanks.  
 Michelle

 Attached is the Summary that Glenn Wright and I used as the basis for 
 reviewing the Steam Purchase Agreement and the Lease today.  
 
 Jay and Clark, please note that there are a couple of drafting follow up 
 instructions contained in the Summary.
 
 Glenn, please let me know if I misstated the resolution of any issues 
 discussed.
 
 David, there is at least one follow-up request in the Summary.
 
 Finally, Michelle Cash, ENA's labor and employment attorney informed me that 
 there are 23 employees currently involved in the operation of the 2 Cogentrix 
 plants and that employee due diligence will take some time.  I am expecting 
 to receive a checklist of employment related documentation shortly and will 
 forward it on to you so that you can have Alamac obtain such information from 
 Cogentrix as soon as possible.  Michelle would like to know what plans have 
 been developed to date as to post-acquisition of the 2 plants.  In short, are 
 we planning to offer all 23 of Cogentrix's employees jobs? 
 
 Steve
