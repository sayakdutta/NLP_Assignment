 Jim, thanks for the call this morning.  As promised, I've attached the
 executive summary for the C'RM business idea we discussed along with a list
 of questions I've been compiling to help me better understand the municipal
 government market space
 
 I'll look forward to our Monday meeting.
 
 Thanks,
 Dick.
