 In preparation for the final VP and MD PRC meeting, Rick has identified you as a key business person to provide feedback on employees in his functional organization.  We have made arrangements for you to access the Performance Management System commonly known as PEP.  The URL is pep.corp.enron.com.  Please take a few minutes to access the system and provide your feedback on the employees indicated under your id.  Rick would greatly appreciate it if you could do this by Friday December 29th, but knowing the holidays are upon us, no later than Tuesday January 2nd.   Your feedback is critical to this process. 
 
 Should you need assistance accessing the system please feel free to contact the help desk at ext. 34777,option 4.  Thanks and have a safe holiday.
