 
 The issue is getting an assignment agreement that GE will sign.  I've 
 requested copies of the docs signed on the Pastoria deal, which is the most 
 recent GE frame assignment transaction.  That should be our starting point.

 Kay,
 
 Once we sign the exclusivity agreement, I would like to get MPC a draft of 
 the Assignment document for their review.  How long will it take to have a 
 version ready for MPC.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Chris
