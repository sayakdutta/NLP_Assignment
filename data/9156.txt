 
 I am not close enough to know Bob's exact role within the group to know the 
 impact of the prospect of losing him.  I am forwarding this to Brent to get 
 his assessment of the impact.  I do know that the number of deals that we do 
 currently has skyrocketed with EOL, so I feel sure that the group is 
 stretched right now.  Again, though, Brent would best be able to address 
 this.  As you are probably aware, I personnally made the commitment to Bob 
 several years ago to help in managing his workload so that he is available as 
 needed at home for his wife.  For Bob's sake, I would want to make sure that 
 he is in a situation where that is understood and appreciated.  
 
 Thank you for contacting me first before going to Bob.  --Sally

 I would like to talk with Bob Bowen about a possible position with me at EBS, 
 but I want to get your approval before I do that.  Please call me at x39509 
 to discuss.
 
 Thanks
