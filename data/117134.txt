 Mark, Taffy said you're under the weather. Hope you're feeling better by the 
 time you open this. The attached draft is revised slightly from the one I 
 previously sent to you for review. The changes are nonsubstantive from your 
 standpoint - -  most of them were made to clarify that there will be 
 offerings from the pipelines other than open seasons. In making the changes, 
 I forgot to do a redlined draft for you, so I am faxing to you a copy 
 redlined by hand. 
 
 Thanks again for all your help.
 
 Tony
