 
 JD approved referral of this to Keffer et al.
 
 Fred is anxious to get something to the counterparty - his preference is 
 yesterday.  I would think that a discussion with Fred about the deal might be 
 in order today, even if by phone.  What is your availability?  John/Carolyn, 
 have you had a chance to review the draft I sent you, and do you have any 
 notions about how to structure this deal?  Is the format ok?  Can we  make it 
 more seller friendly without being ridiculous?
 
 When the initial draft is ready, it will need to go to Matt Gockerman (ENA 
 Tax) and Herman Manis (structuring accountant).
 
 Ciao,
