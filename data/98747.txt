 Thanks for setting up this meeting. It will have to be Thursday Morning for 
 me or before 1:30 PM. I have to catch a flight to New York for business later 
 that afternoon.

 It was nice to meet you. Will we be able to review some possible transcript 
 candidates on or before Jan. 11? Thanks
 
 Cheers

 Just want to let you know that Beth Stier of Innovision will meet with us on 
 Thursday, Jan. 11 (exact time to come) to discuss the treatment for this 
 video.  Beth is out of town today and will let me know available times on 
 Monday.  See you soon and have a great weekend.
