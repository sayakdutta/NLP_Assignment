 The legal entity is Euromark Design's, Inc. (d/b/a Crate & Barrel). My 
 understanding is it is a two year trade for less than 5000 tpy each year. I 
 have agreed to confirm this trade on an Omnibus form without a credit annex 
 (standard Annex A only required).  The only issue is that the financial 
 statements are in the name of both Euromarket Designs, Inc. and Euromarket 
 Designs, Inc. II. We will need legal to address how me get both names on the 
 confirm.  We can talk about it on Monday.  Hope you had a good holiday.
