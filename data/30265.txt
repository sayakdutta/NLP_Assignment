 
 I think so!!! Lets reschedule.  I have to leave early to take the kids to the doctor.
 
  
     
 My meeting with Louise has now been re-rescheduled for Friday at 1:00.  Do you want to:
 
 1.  Do a quick lunch tomorrow
 2.  Do a quick lunch tomorrow and schedule another time for a swanky lunch
 3.  Reschedule
 
 What's up with this lunch, do we need planetary alignment to make it happen...
 
  
     
 Steve, FYI
 Kim Hillis called to reschedule your meeting with Louise Kitchen from Tuesday, 9am to Thursday, 11am.
 Thanks, LV
