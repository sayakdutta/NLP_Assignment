 
 I spoke with Jamie this morning and explained our concerns (which master to use, given the merger is there a legal need for novation, since these are NY law documents would assignment be more appropriate, what collateral is involved to be transferred) and have since received a message from their lawyer in New York.  If they insist on a novation (which is not a commonly used concept in US law), you could certainly help by letting us know if there is anything to which you would object in their draft. I'll let you know if it gets to that.  Otherwise I think we're under control.

 Hi Mark,
 
 Sorry that this is proving to be tougher than we thought to connect.
 
 Jamie Wood at RBS asks below if all looks okay to you in terms of the Novations?
 
 Is there anything I can do to help?
 
 Many thanks,
 Suzanne
 
 
     
 
 Suzanne,
 
 I'm afraid I keep missing Mark Taylor.  Do you mind following up with him to
 see how he's getting on and whether there is any problems with the
 documents?
 
 I will keep trying but would appreciate your help.
 
 Thanks and regards,
 Jamie

 Hi Jamie,
 
 You may need to translate the below for me (i.e. what is DSL and CRRM)?
 Also, is Enron North American Corp the signator on each of the two
 lines?
 
 Thanks,
 Suzanne
 
 

    
 
 Suzanne,
 
 
 Limits are:
 
 NW FX & DSL, US$13m, 2 yrs, no security

 Hi Jamie,
 
 Thanks for this.  I think it may have to be sent to North America.
 However, we would like to see a list of the lines that we would be
 novating.
 
 Thanks,
 Suzanne

 Hi Suzanne,
 
 Please find attached the Novation Request letter which outlines the
 actions
 required to novate your trades from the NatWest name to the RBS.   The
 documents which need to be executed are :-
 
 1.  Novation Agreement
 
 *       You will get this from Diane Jeannot from our Legal & Compliance
 in
 NY soon
 *       This is to authorise the novation of the trades from the NW
 books
 into RBS books, and to be covered by your existing RBS Master ISDA
 *       To sign both copies, but return only one (fax and mail)
 
 2.  Credit Support Annex
 
 *       Please see attached CSA Authorisation, please sign at the bottom
 and
 return via fax
 *       As there is collateral tied to the NW Master ISDA, we will need
 to
 novate the collateral as well.
 
 3.  Letter from your Guarantor - Enron Corp
 
 *       To novate the guarantee in favour of NW to RBS
 
 4.  RBS Settlement Instructions Acknowledgement
 
 *       See attached RBS Settlement Instructions and Acknowledgement
 letter.
 *       This is to acknowledge that anything booked in the RBS names
 have to
 be paid into RBS accounts provided, so these new instructions should be
 distributed to your payments division.
 *       Please sign and return by fax
 
 Please let me know if you have any queries at all.  All documents can be
 returned to me, my address is on the Novation Letter.
 
 One thing to note, the deadline is actually October 3rd for all
 documents to
 be returned.  Unfortunately, we are a little late in sorting it out with
 Adam and sending you the documents, but I will appreciate if you could
 arrange for this to be done as soon as possible, and let me know a
 realistic
 date for return.  Apologies for the rush.
 
 
 Thanks and regards,
 Jamie Wood
