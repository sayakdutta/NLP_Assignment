 was pretty cool, but not somewhere i would hang out every sat.  i didn't do 
 anything this past weekend b/c i think that i am getting a cold.  if we don't 
 do dinner sat night let's definately meet out somewhere.  we need to explore 
 downtown some.  how is the new job?  are you working 100 hours/wk?
