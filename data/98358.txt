 I am on the run now, and I have not had a chance to finish the second draft
 of the answers to the DOJ questions.  However, because of schedules, I
 wanted to put something in your hands as soon as possible.
 
 My secretary will be e-mailing and faxing the draft in progress to you
 shortly.
 
 I will do additional work on the draft this evening when I return from my
 meeting out of the office.
 
 So, if you have comments on the new draft, please e-mail or fax them to me
 so that I can incorporate them into tonight's draft.
