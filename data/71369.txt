 
 The agreements haven't been executed, so please revise.  Could you also set 
 me up a stand alone release, so that I can replace the release GE submitted 
 on some of the other turbines?
 
 Thanks,

 Will do.  I'll make the change in the remaining agreements.  Do you want
 the revised form to be included in the Fountain Valley GE and ABB
 Agreements (execution copies of which went out yesterday) or have those
 agreements already been executed?
 
 


  
 
 
 I agree.  Please revise the form accordingly.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
 
 
 
 
 
 

 

 
  
 
 I have reviewed both the ABB and GE Agreements and have spoken to Paul
 about this issue.  I do not believe it is necessary for the amount of
 consideration to be listed in the final lien form. I believe that ABB
 and GE can simply acknowledge that Seller has been paid in full or that
 Purchaser has paid all sums owing to Seller under the agreement, or
 similar language.

 Pete,
 
 I have a question.  Is it necessary for the amount of consideration to
 be
 listed in the final lien form (exhibit R or S, something like that)?  If
 so, what amount goes in there?  Will this defeat what we are trying to
 do
 in keeping the original price a supposed mystery?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
