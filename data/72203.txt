 As you may know, we are proceeding with development of the Ft. Pierce, FL 
 project using one of the MHI 501F turbines. Several contract issues need to 
 be sorted out with MHI, including the execution of a break out contract for 
 the Ft. Pierce unit, certain scope changes, and a NOx guarantee of 25PPM. 
 There are obviously other issues related to off balance sheet financing that 
 will need attention. 
 
 Brett, Mike and I have decided to have a weekly conference call to make sure 
 these issues are being addressed. We would all appreciate each of you being 
 available next Thursday at 10AM CST for a kick off call so that we can 
 hopefully figure out exactly what we're dealing with. If you can't attend in 
 person, we'll set up a call in number.
 
 Please let me know your availability at your earliest convenience. Also, 
 please feel free to invite others which you feel should be involved in this 
 kick off discussion.
 
 Lastly, for purposes of the break out contract, Brett has provided below an 
 electronic copy of the executed contract for both units.
 
 Thanks and regards,
 
 Ben
