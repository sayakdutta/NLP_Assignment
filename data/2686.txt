 (understanding there circumstance) was stuck long 4 lots.  We dicided to
 help them out and take them today.  So I had my Henry Hub trader sell out
 Oct 1st.  Car said they found there problem.  I tried calling the trader
 over there and it was a penny bid over were we sold it.  Could you say
 something to your trader over there to see if you could let us out.
