 you like to join us for the game?  Michelle

  Michelle:  You have 6 seats for the Orioles-White Sox game on Monday
 evening, August 14.  These are the "firm seats" that I mentioned -- along
 the third baseline above the visitor's dugout.  Game time is 7:35 p.m.  I'll
 send the tickets down to you in the next day or two.  Have fun!
