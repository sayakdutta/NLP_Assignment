 i got your email thread right here, dog.  Hey does this really go the Park's enron email?  Cool!  I bet not, I bet it goes to L2q3r6ft Raptor partnership in the Caymans.  In fact, I bet Joe is not Joe at all, instead he Joe Lay.  You know the second gunman......hmmmmmm..

 Hunting season is over. It is now working season. All email threads are
 gone. No one talks to one another. This is wrong.
 
 I therefor propose man night February 28th, 2002 at some location yet to be
 determined, such as Tony's mexican food...on Ella.
