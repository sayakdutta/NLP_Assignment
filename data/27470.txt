 John,
 
 Here's the response from MSN.
 
 	"We have changed his account to the $5/month plan and credited his account
 for previous "overbillings".  For some reason, the account was created
 as a "Standard" $21.95/month account.
 
 He should see a $5 charge on his statement going forward. His next
 billing date is October 11, 2001."
 
 Is this okay with you?
 
 Please let me know if this does not happen.
 
 Thanks,
 Marie Newhouse
