 Barry,
  
 I am out on bed rest until after my baby is born.  I have sent your request to Tammie Schoppe and she is going to put the meeting together for you today.
  
 Hope your drive back from Denver was not to bad.  Dina told me that you went straight home.  Sounds terrible.
  
 Take care.

 Pls set up a 15- 30 minute meeting with John and Mark Whitt ( Denver ) to discuss Williston Basin ( storage blowdown). 
 
 Pls advise.
