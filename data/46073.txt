 find out what name their FERC license is in.  However, we still do not have a 
 Credit sign off on power yet, so I am also working with ("nagging") the power 
 Credit person to get me some headroom.  Let's just say ANP is "evolving" as 
 we speak!

 Tana --
 
 Thanks for the prompt response.  Does this mean that eventually they'll be 
 approved for power, but not at this time?  Or, we'll hold up the transaction 
 ID until the power side is approved.

 I heard back from the power lawyer and they do not appear to have a FERC 
 license.  He is going to have to talk to her and clear this up.

 Tana --- I talked to Jeff Mansfield this a.m. and he implied that they should 
 be receiving a blessing for transacting power.   I'm not sure where he got 
 that info, but it must not be true, huh?
 Thanks, Griff

 We approved these guys yesterday for gas.  Our power team is looking at them 
 for power, but a message came down from legal that they will probably be shut 
 down for power.  They are open for gas.

 Hey guys --- This company wants to be approved for both gas and power 
 transactions.
 Thanks,
 Griff

 Brad,
 
 Here's another one.  They come in groups you know.  Hopefully, this will be 
 the last credit question for a bit.
 
 How is the credit part coming on this company's app?  The latest Access data 
 base entry appears to be October 23rd.
 
 Thanks,
 Griff
