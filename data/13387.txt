 this deal.  Could you get with Twanda to do that?  THanks.  MIchelle

 Craig,
 
 We were supposed to have a conference call with labor/employment personnel 
 early next week.  Has that been scheduled yet?  Also, I will not be able to 
 attend at 4:00 on Tuesday, but will see if someone from HR/benefits can be 
 there.

 Please attend a meeting in EB2988 at 4 pm on Tuesday, October 31st. If you 
 are unavailable to attend please have someone represent you at the meeting.
 
 The plan for the meeting is to:
 
 Go through individuals' findings regarding completeness of information 
 available in data room binders, issues encountered that my impact the value 
 of the assets to Enron, and any additional information required for Leaf 
 River and Woodland.
 Provide an update regarding the status of Woodland and deal stopper issues.
 
 The issue relating to Woodland and the hesitancy to fully proceed on the due 
 diligence relates to two potential deal stoppers -- security of fiber supply 
 and labor union issues. Our preference was to better understand these issues 
 before fully engaging in the due diligence process, and incurring the 
 associated costs, but the constrained timing has limited our ability to 
 accomplish that. At this stage it appears as though we will proceed to submit 
 a mid-November bid, and therefore we should proceed with all necessary due 
 diligence for Woodland.
