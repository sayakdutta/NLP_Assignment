 Corrections to #4 below.  Originally had EPCA, should be EDIDE.

 Sheila, as discussed yesterday, I need to do the following:
 
 Open a brokerage account at Morgan Stanley for Enron de Inversiones de 
 Energia S.C.A. (an Argentine company) (EDIDE)
 This account will hold ADRs that will be contributed or transferred into its 
 account by Enron Pipeline Company-Argentina S.A.  (EPCA)(account #038-088357) 
 at Morgan Stanley.
 EPCA will contribute 431,300 ADRs in Transportadora Gas del Sur (TGS) into 
 EDIDE's new account.  That contribution represents the capital contribution 
 that EPCA is obligated to make under the capital increase resolution dated 
 February 20th, 2000.
 After the ADR's are transferred into EDIDE's accounts, EDIDE will need to 
 convert such ADR's into ordinary Class B shares in TGS so that they can be 
 registered accordingly in Argentina.
 
 Sheila, I am forwarding a hard copy of this e-mail with appropriate support 
 (corporate resolutions authorizing me to open this account, resolution 
 authorizing the increase in capital and some forms that I had Eduardo 
 Ojea-Quintana (President of EDIDE) sign).
 
 Please review and advise of what else you need to finalize this transaction.
 
 Best Regards,
 
 RFR

 Sheila, finally ready to open up the account at Morgan Stanley for EDIDE so 
 that EPCA can transfer the correct amount of ADRs.  I have the Corporate 
 Resolution from EDIDE.  I understand that the contact at Morgan Stanley has 
 changed.  Please advise.

 I will be out on maternity leave soon (hopefully).  In my absence, please 
 call Sheila Glover (3-3210) for any questions that you may have.  If you just 
 need a copy of an old report, please call Aneela Charania at 3-0951.
