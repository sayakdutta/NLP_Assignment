 
 Hey Jim,
 
 Thanks for the note.  Nothing much new to report here.  Ted was in South 
 Beach last weekend but came home a day early to work.  He's still trying to 
 talk me into buying a new car which I would like to do but can't figure out 
 what I really want.  I'm speaking at a conference in Key West next week and 
 will stay through the weekend - I think it's the only place left on the 
 continent that's warm.  Nothing like Zurich here but it's been in the 40's 
 and rainy - seems like forever since I've been fully warm through.
 
 Let us know when you find a place to live
 
 Mark
