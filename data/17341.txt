 (SACRAMENTO) =01) Assembly Republicans united Monday in asking Governor Gra=

 Davis to call a special session of the California legislature to deal with=
 =20
 skyrocketing natural gas prices.
 
 =01&Families and businesses are reeling every month from extraordinary gas=

 prices.  Pardon the expression, but the natural gas crisis no longer belong=
 s=20
 on California=01,s back burner,=018 said Assembly Republican leader Bill Ca=
 mpbell=20
 (R =01) Villa Park).
 
 Assembly Republicans unanimously signed a letter to Governor Gray Davis=20
 asking for him to convene a special session of the legislature to deal with=
 =20
 California=01,s skyrocketing natural gas bills.  Republicans delivered the=
 =20
 letter to Davis this morning.
 
 =01&A special session is both a symbolic and a practical necessity.  It tel=
 ls=20
 Californians that we care about their skyrocketing gas bills.  It tells=20
 businesses everywhere that California is going to provide for its future=20
 energy needs,=018 said Campbell.  =01&Practically speaking, a special sessi=
 on also=20
 allow us to pass legislation which can take effect immediately.=018
 
 Republicans believe the electricity and natural gas crises are inextricably=
 =20
 linked.
 
 =01&California=01,s natural gas crisis is completely intertwined with its=
 =20
 electricity crisis,=018 said Campbell.  =01&Any plan to deal with our elect=
