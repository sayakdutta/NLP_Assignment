 Howard,
 This memo is regarding the 91,297 MMBtu imbalance that was created in April 
 of 1999 on 
 transport contract #012-41991-02-004. The transport delivery off HPLC was 
 shorted to keep
 Entex whole on a minimum purchase from ENA. Originally this transport 
 imbalance was to be cleared
 the next month in May of 1999. Some of the imbalance was cleared in May of 
 1999, but 91,297 MMBtu
 still remains as a imbalance on this contract. We need to monitor the IFHSC 
 Index for the upcoming months
 so that when one is compatible with the IFHSC Index of April of 1999 we can 
 clear this imbalance. We will
 need to allocated 91,297 MMBtu extra to the transport. This will reduce the 
 purchase from ENA by 91,297 
 MMBtu for that month.  I need you to watch over whoever is doing the Reliant 
 Energy - Entex allocation to 
 make sure this happens.
 
 
 Thanks,
 Michael
