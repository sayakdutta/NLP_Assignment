 dinner.  I bet everyone there heard about all his physical issues.
 
 
 
 
    
  
 He just called and now his weight is back up.  I told him I thought he was 
 having anxiety.  He's going to the closing dinner tonight after all, so he 
 should feel better being around all his buddies at Pappas Steak House.  Hell, 
 I wish I could go too!

 He needs to stay away from the scales.
 
 
    
  
 I think so too, but you can't convince him of that fact.  I'm calling him now.
 
 He said he's ok, just hanging out, but is going to weigh again at 2pm.  He 
 said he'd call me if he's lost more weight.

 I think he needs meds, including Prozac or something like that.  He is flat 
 out having an anxiety attack.
 
 
    
  
 There's a front coming in, and I'm surprised my sinuses aren't bad.  You know 
 since I got off the allergy shots, I've been feeling a whole lot better.  
 I'll be interested to see what the CT scan looked like too.  
 
 Dan called and said he had lost 4 pounds in 2 hours and was wigging out.  He 
 was going to wait another 2 hours and then call the doctor.  He's driving 
 himself crazy.  They need to give him some meds to calm him down.  I hope 
 it's nothing serious.
 
 I don't blame you for wanting to go home.  I know where to find you if I need 
 you.  I'll put calls into voicemail, but I'm not going to tell anyone you are 
 at home (unless you want me to).

 At the risk of sounding like a wimp, I may just go home after my hair 
 apptment.  I don't feel up to snuff, and I think it is my sinuses (check the 
 weather).  I can work from there just as well as I can from here, only in my 
 jammys.
