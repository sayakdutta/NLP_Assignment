 
 I can show you what the difference is between Cheyenne Hub daily prices and CIG first of the month index prices, but that is kind of like apples and oranges.  To clarify, you do not have to buy on Enron Online (EOL), we can quote you physical prices over the phone and you can use EOL for price discovery.  You do not have to decide that now.  My recommendation is the attached:
 
 
 Major changes are:
 
 Volume - 20,000 mmbtu/d
 Price - Gas Daily Cheyenne Midpoint plus $.05
 Demand Charge- $6,000 per month
 
 In addition. Enron will provide market based pricing for additional volumes above 20,000 mmbtu
 
 All of this is of course subject to negotiation of the appropriate contracts and Enron's review of the PSCo transportation contract.
 
 Let me know what you think.
 
 
 
 
     
 
 Mark - do you have historical information on the average price of gas sold
 on enrononline vs the cig index.   This information would be helpful for us
 in determining how much volume we would want to utilize on the enrononline
 pricing.
