 Sara, I have stopped by your office but you are not around.  Please provide 
 the following information/clarification in light of your conversations with 
 other folks:
 
 1. We do not have to send Bear the Officers/Traders list and other documents 
 with the agreements to get things moving?
 
 2.  If we do, then who do I contact or ask Richard Sage to contact to get 
 this information re: the correct slate of officers updated?  No one has 
 advised me of these steps.  And actually, if we have to do this, I would like 
 Stephanie to take the lead on finishing her work on this part of the project.
 
 3. Re: this attorney Cheryl at Bear  that you have talked to -- what is her 
 full name, phone, and fax?
 
 
 Thanx.
