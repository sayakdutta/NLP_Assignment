 I am so sorry, I honestly forgot about lunch. No excuses on my part, I feel
 soooo bad. If you two are not totally mad at me, then perhaps, we can really
 have lunch again on me. I feel like an idiot. I hope you and Debra will
 forgive me. Tell Debra I apologize for missing lunch. I will e-mail her
 myself. Anyway, e-mail me back please to let me know.
 
 Sorry,
 
 Majed
 
     
 Where were you?  We waited and waited.  Debra says that you owe her two
 lunches now!

     That sounds great to me, see you on Wed.

    Let's plan on Wednesday.  How about we meet at Treebeard's in the
 tunnel
    around 12.  Let me know if that works for you.  If you are not a fan
 of
    Treebeards we can do something else.

        Tuesday is fine with me, or in the alternative, Wed. is also
 fine.
    Just
       let
       me know Gerald, since I know you might have lunch plans with one
 of
    your
       girlfriends j/k.
 
       Talk to you soon,
 
       Majed
       
                             
       No problem.  I will just destroy the direct deposit slip.  Good
 luck
       with
       the write on competition.  Lunch sounds great.  This week is kind
 of
       busy
       but maybe next week.  Tuesday or Wednesday?  Yes, I guess we can
    allow
       Debra to go with us.
 
       Gerald

          Gerald,
 
          I am so sorry that I have not gotten back with you regarding
 the
       message
          you
          left me. I have just been so busy with the write on competition
    for
       law
          review. It is finally over thank god. Anyway, I have electronic
       deposit,
          so
          I don't need my check stub. How is everything with your new
 clerk?
    I
          hope
          all is well with you. Let me know when you are free for lunch
 so
    we
       can
          all
          go out (I guess we will drag Debra along j/k). Anyway, I want
 to
    say
          that it
          was great working with you. Write back soon.
 
          Best Regards,
 
          Majed Nachawati
