 Tiny, I have been sending the analyticals to Michael.  I m sorry that they
 are not reaching him.  Ill switch to plan B.  I will  have hard copies of
 the analyticals he needs when I see you in Gallup on Thursday.  I have
 attached my PCB file to this memo for review.

 Please see the attached file and notes on this years pigging activites from
 Station 5 through Needles.  This does not include all the analyticals for
 this time period but should represent 90% of all pigging activites.  Filter
 and scrubber samples may also exist.
 
 Larry can you give a hand with this?  I thought these results were already
 forwarded to Penn State weeks ago and being forwarded on an ongoing basis.
 They have yet to receive any historical sampling data either.  Please
 advise.
