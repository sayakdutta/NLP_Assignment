 
 I received a fax in yesterday, so I'll review it.

 In a seperate e-mail, I sent out the LOI to TECO which incorporated most of 
 Fred's comments. On the tolling term sheet, I agree with Fred's comments. Kay 
 - where do we stand on having outside counsel review this? I have indicated 
 to TECO that we will have a draft tolling term sheet to them by Wednesday. 
 Please let me know.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Ben

 Ben/Kay:
 
 Attached are my comments on the Midway Tolling term sheet and LOI.  
 
 I will be out on Monday but will have my cell phone on.  My conversations 
 will be regularly interrupted by golf strokes, but I will do my best to be 
 available.
 
 Call me if you have specific questions/issues to discuss.  I have asked Dave 
 Kellermeyer to call either one of you on Monday with an answer to the minimum 
 block size for the tolling term sheet.  I am taking the air permit home to 
 review and will leave you a message if I determine the answer.
