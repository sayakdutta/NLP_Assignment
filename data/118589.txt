 similar issues here when they first came up.  Maybe after we've been through 
 these with him once he will negotiate them in the first case and only bring 
 the tough sticking points to us.

 Please deal with this for me - but my initial thoughts are that we cannot 
 address the majority of these.
 
 Thanks

 PA
 
 They wish to amend the PA such that:
 
 Enron warrants that their use of the passwords and the Website does not cause 
 them to breach any third party rights 
 they only notify us of unauthorised disclosure or use of passwords upon their 
 learning of the same.
 they can withdraw or amend information provided to Enron from time to time
 
 ETA
 
 They do not want to be bound by future terms and conditions imposed by Enron 
 (see 1(iii))
 They wish to restrict our use of information to Enron Group companies (see 
 last sentence of 2(b))
 They feel unable to make the statement in the first sentence of 2(d), since 
 they trade through various group company agents on behalf of a BV principal
 To establish a tangible audit trail and for verification, they wish to be 
 able to verify our paper confirms (see 3(e))
 They wish to restructure the indemnity entirely (see 4), such that each party 
 is liable for losses suffered by the other due to its own wilful 
 default/negligence/omission.
 They wish to have the right to terminate the ETA (see 6(a)), and wish that 
 electronic notices be deemed sent when the sender receives notice from the 
 system of delivery or failed delivery (see 6(e)).
 
 Some of these are more important than others, but there are some key points.  
 Please let me know what you think - thanks
 
 Justin
