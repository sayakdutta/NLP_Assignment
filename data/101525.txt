 This is Bobby here at Enron. I work in retail power in EES.
 
 We met  ages ago here in Houston.
 I started working here at Enron a month ago.
 
 I work on 6 but make it to 31 and 32 from time to time to talk to people there.
 
 Hope things are good on your end.
 
 Bobby
 
 ps. If you see Joel Bennett around, tell him I said hi. (I can't remember which floor he's on.)
