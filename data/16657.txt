 The Senate Energy Committee is holding a hearing Wednesday morning at 8am in 
 room 4203 to debate AB 5x and AB 6x.  These are the measures that passed the 
 ECA committee last week, relating to the ISO/PX governing boards, and utility 
 retention of generation assets.
  
 AB 1x passed out of the Assembly Appropriations Committee this evening with 
 all the Dems voting for it and one Republican.  There were three amendments: 
 1) a $400 million price tag was added, 2) a sunset review after 5 years was 
 added, and 3) clarification was made that DWR is not permitted to get into 
 the T&D business.  Rumor has it that Keeley understands that the 5.5 cents 
 has to come out of the bill on the Senate side.  The floor vote is schedule 
 for 8pm tonight.
