 
 Well, the origination tickets are up for grabs if you want them. I have been 
 informed by Mollie, Oh Holy Keeper of the Tickets, that you must, and I 
 quote, "come over here and beg me" if you want to procure free seats to 
 tonight's game.
 
 The ball is now in your court. I'd suggest driving down the middle, faking to 
 the left, butt-kissing to the right, and taking it straight to the hole for a 
 slam dunk. Good luck!
