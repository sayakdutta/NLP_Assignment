 
 Hi Dan!
 
 I am glad that your family is well.  My heart is so heavy with the tragedy of the WTC.  I cannot fully comprehend the enormity of it all.
 
 I will be glad to bring the tape in.  I am actually going to be in the office late Sunday afternoon to begin packing my desk.  We are temporarily moving to the 13th floor mid next week while they reconstruct our floor.  
 
 I will have the tape on my desk in an envelope with your name on it, too.  Also, I have a little book that you lent me with nice verses.  I will bring it as well. 
 
 Thanks and take care.  Kim.
 
 
     
 
 Kim,
 
 Hope none of your family/friends were impacted by the WTC disaster.  We had a scare in our family.  My bro & sis-in-law, and 3 other cousins & their spouses are doctors.  Did not hear from them or about them for days.  Heard from my brother for the 1st time last night.  They were working round the clock helping the injured, so had no time to call!.  I was 90% sure they were OK, but that 10% caused sooooo much anxiety.  I just cannot imagine the plight of folks who probably are 150% sure that their loved ones are no more, but are still clinging on to some hope/miracle!.
 
 I will probably swing by Enron tomorrow around 12:30 pm.  If possible, could you bring the tape on Logic of Sprituality with you.  If you are not going to be around, can you leave it on your desk!
 
 Hope things are going well for you & Martha.  Please say hi to her. say hi to Janell too!
 
 Take Care
 
 Dan
