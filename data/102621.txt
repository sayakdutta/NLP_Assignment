 new pad...in the interest of saving $$$ I will probably take you up on the 
 futon offer.  
 
 Well, it's Monday and I'm assuming Ted's back in town (not that I've heard a 
 peep out of him).  I'm very much at a cross-roads with the situation.  On the 
 one hand, I want to be unaffected and aloof and on the other hand I don't 
 want to make this that easy for him.  I think I deserve more that just being 
 swept under the rug.  So, my debate becomes - Do I just let this thing go all 
 together OR do I try and get some resolution?  
 
 I would love to get a call from you hear at work.  The best time for me is 
 probably before 11:30 or after 12:30 Houston time.  
 
 Talk to you soon,
 Susan
