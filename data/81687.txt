 errol, 
 I caught one more of the same deal.
 
 The cells are p23 and q23.
 
  
     
 Errol,
 I noticed a small mistake late last night.  Their is West orig on your Orig 
 schedule that is not 0.  It is already on the west schedule so the value just 
 needs to be taken off your orig schedule tab.  
 
 The cells that need to be set = to 0 are p41 and q41
 
 thanks,
 brad
