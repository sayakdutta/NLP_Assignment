 Hi Guys-
 I just wanted to let you all know that Jaron finally popped the
 question!  Of course, I said yes and we are just so excited!  We will be
 very busy these next few months, but wanted to let everyone know that
 the date will be August 11.  I know it seems soon, but we have been
 doing a little planning and are ready to start our new lives together.
 So, if possible-save the date!  We would love to have you join us.  Take
 care and talk to you soon!!
 Laura
