 status.  I believe that Cline has different counsel now, and I will find out 
 about this asap.  Michelle

 Please look into this and speak with our Charleston counsel, and then apprise 
 the people copied on this note.
 
 Thanks, Alan

 I was contacted by Cline's attorney who is handling the Clonch lawsuit.  He 
 wants to depose Enron emploees with direct knowledge of the events leading up 
 to suit filed by Clonch.  I told him that we will have an Enron lawyer 
 contact him.  He is apparently in direct contact with the firm in Charleston 
 representing us.  I will wait until we talk before contacting anyone 
 regarding the matter.
