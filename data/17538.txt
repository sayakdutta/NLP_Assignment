 Please call me to discuss your question.  (415.782.7822)  Customers could try 
 to "bypass" the utility, but until Dec. '95 (PUC final policy decision) and 
 AB 1890, it was against the law to have direct access, so you may be 
 misinterpreting the yellow book just a bit.  There were other forms of 
 "bypass" at that time, but DA as we think of it today was illegal.  Give me a 
 call and we can try to clear things up (specific references to where in the 
 YB you're getting this impression will be helpful).    Glad to talk to you on 
 Friday and be happy to talk more if you have any other questions, or desire 
 any follow up.  
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Jeff, 
         The Yellow Book is in the mail. I read it over the weekend and found 
 it to be a very good backgrounder for this whole thing. Thanks for lending it 
 to me, and thanks again for your time Friday.
         A followup question: You had told me Friday that the arrival of QF's 
 and other non-utility generators, including plants in neighboring states, had 
 large customers chomping at the bit for competition, but frustrated because 
 the big IOUs still controlled the grid and held the customers captive. But 
 the Yellow book said that already some large customers had found ways to 
 bypass the IOUs and get direct access/retail wheeling. 
         Could you explain? 
         Thanks, 
         Dale. 
 PS - Please don't forget to call Steve Kean to let him know I'll be calling 
 him. Thanks.
