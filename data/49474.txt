 Can you, please, call Shu and provide him with information about EBS?

 Dear Dr. Kaminski,
 
 I enjoyed your talk this afternoon at IEOR very much.
 I wonder if you could point me to some information
 resource on Enron's bandwidth market.
 
 I am a Ph.D student at IEOR. I work with Professor
 Oren and Professor Varaiya from EECS department on
 the topic of pricing the Internet. In particular, I am designing
 pricing mechanism in the framework of the DiffServ
 architecture which is the latest proposal made by
 IETF to provide scalable service differentiation.
 I would very much like to get in touch with people
 in Enron working on the similar topics.
 
 Thank you very much.
