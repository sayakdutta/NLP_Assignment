 
 I want to keep track of summer interns.  Please make me a desk file.  This list is missing summer interns under Brent.  I have asked Jana to send me an updated list.  I have also sent her a message letting her know that Sheri Thomas now reports into Andy Zipper and that she needs to communicate with Sheri and Andy directly regarding Greg Carlson's internship.  
 
 Also, did you keep copies of resumes of the analysts?  Can you pull resumes for the interns that will be assigned to us?  I would like to review them.  
 
 I also want to hold a meeting later this week with all supervisors who will have interns reporting to them.  Please check with the listed supervisor on Jana's list.  If one of their direct reports will actually be the primary supervisor, please get that name.  Thanks. -Sally
