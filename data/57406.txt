 years from commercial production.  Ideally, we could get that confirmation 
 from someone familiar with the technology but without any financial interest 
 in its success.  Their technology pitch sounded good, but I don't know enough 
 to recognize the potential shortcomings.  I want to feel comfortable that you 
 all feel this is real, then I would be happy to have me and my team spend 
 some time with them.
 
 


   
 Thank you for participating in yesterday's meeting.  We spoke with Harvey and 
 Jim after the meeting and they took to speed to market comments to heart.  
 There is an opportunity for Enron to participate with MEC in the early 
 development of their company, but it seems the one thing they want is the one 
 thing we also want, people.  I would appreciate your thoughts and comments on 
 the possiblity of creating a small team that could work directly with MEC as 
 part of a potential investment and strategic relationship.  Given our 
 resource constraints, this would most likely be part of the organization that 
 sees the greatest strategic impact from MEC's development.
