 
 Thanks, Joan.  I'll have IT look into it.  You can always send an e-mail to 
 the "office of the chairman" e-mail address.  Additionally, Mr. Lay's name in 
 the directory is "Kenneth Lay."  SRS
 
 
    
  
 
 The "Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling" email address does not work.  When one writes 
 in ken lay, "Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling" appears, however, there is a delivery 
 failure to this address.  You may want to check this out.
