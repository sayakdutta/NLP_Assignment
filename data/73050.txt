 
 Chris and Mike,
 
 We are trying to do some sales tax planning, and need to know when the first 
 LM 6000's will be ready to ship (or store, as the case may be).  I know there 
 are projected dates in the purchase agreement, but those were more targets 
 than commitment on the first few units.  Can you give the current status?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
