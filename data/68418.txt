 Can you do the same thing with a different book id?  Instead of book counterparty FT-CAND-TERMIN, move any deals with the FT-TERMIN-GD book to the bankruptcy book from NG-Price.  Financial deals only.  Thanks.  Let me know if you need any further clarification, should be the exact same script as yesterday, just substitute FT_TERMIN-GD for the two books you were looking for yesterday.

 Deal moves has been completed and retranslated.

 1. move to the appropriate book based on the logic - Canadian deal needs to go to CAD
 2. should only have to change deals from NG-Price to bankruptcy (deals are not in any other book)
 3. The Canadian logic deals will probably be in GJ and the US logic should be in NG
 4. Financial only
 5. Cutoff date 1/1/2002

 These are interbook deals and I need to confirm the following:
 
 1. Which Bankruptcy book you want to move the deals to? BANKRUPTCY (166660) or BANKRUPTCY-CAD (166762)?
 2. Change the counterparty of the deals associated with FT-CAND-TERMIN (166764) or FT-CAND-GONE-PR (166767) from NG-PRICE(11360), ENA-FT-WT-SOCAL(108201), ENA-WT-CAL(105544) to Bankruptcy (166660 or 166762)?
 3. Should we should NGGJ as the commodity instead of NG?
 4. Financial deals only
 5. Cutoff date 1-jan-2002
 
 
 
  
     
 
 Those two counterparties could be currently  in NG-Price, ENA-WT-Socal, or ENA-WT-Cal, not just NG-Price.
 
 Thanks
