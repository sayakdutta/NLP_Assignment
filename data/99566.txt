 What we are looking at is cleaning up for December.  So the schedule strips have already been created.  For settlement purposes, we have to go in and clean house.  So it wouldn't help to change the deal in Deal Entry and  I'm not even sure that we can do it anyway because of deal preservation.  So we are looking at a time strip for example Dec 8-31 to zero out "Counter party".  
 
 I will be talking to John tomorrow morning to find out more about the West Bankruptcy book.  Don't know anything about it.
 
 Thanks again,
 
 Diana
 
  
     
 Good Afternoon Diana,
 
 Did I capture your question correctly?
 
 The users want to update the chapter11.exe program, that was developed to 'zero-out' schedule strip volumes for a given counterparty for a given day, to allow the users to zero-out the volume for a range of days?
 
 
 IT Questions
 1.  Schedule strips only get created for deals 2 days before day of flow.  So, based on the current design, the date range, at least looking forward, would only be a couple of days.
 - Option 1:  Maybe, instead of zeroing out schedules, we should adjust the dates on the deal.  This would prevent schedule strips from even being created after a certain date?
 
 2.  Working with John Postlethwaite & Stacey White, Will Smith has a program that converts deals from the real Enron books to a newly created West Bankruptcy book.  Will this work for you guys?
 
 Anyway, just give me a call when you get a chance.
 
 Thanks,  David Poston
