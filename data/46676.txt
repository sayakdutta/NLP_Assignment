 
 Below is an email Dovie sent out a while back referencing the procedures for 
 sending out NDA's.  When you need an NDA, please email me the following 
 information.  I then contact a paralegal that maintains a database of our 
 NDA's to check for conflicts.  Once we've done that I will prepare and send 
 out the NDA as directed by you, then work with you as appropriate in the 
 particular client situation to get the NDA back signed.  Once it is fully 
 executed I need to send the original to the same paralegal here who is the 
 central gatekeeper of all NDA's.  
 
 My number is x33399 if I can assist you with anything.

 Earlier this week, we met Tana Jones (Senior Legal Specialist) and Leslie 
 Hansen (Legal Counsel) with ENA (servicing ENW) to discuss the process for 
 executing NDAs.  Leslie will serve as in-house legal counsel for EMS while 
 Tana will be the Senior Legal Assistant for all documentation such as NDAs.
 
 There are two general forms that ENW uses for NDAs.  The first form is 
 bilateral and used when both parties are disclosing confidential business 
 information.  The second is unilateral and more clearly and thoroughly 
 articulates Enron's interests.  The second form should be used when Enron is 
 the only party disclosing confidential information.
 
 When you would like to execute an NDA with an outside party, please contact 

 following information:
  1.  Which form you would like to use
  2.  General description of the confidential information to be shared
  3.  Counterparty's legal name
  4.  Counterparty's address
  5.  Contact name at Counterparty
  6.  How/where to send NDA and appropriate information (fax or email and 
 number or address).
 
 Regards,
