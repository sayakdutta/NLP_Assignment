 
 My travel lately has not allowed time to interview.  Gretchen Jennings in HR 
 is supposed to be setting up interviews with appropriate candidates for me.  
 She has a stack of all of the resumes that either I have received or those 
 that responded to the posting.  I hope to start interviewing next week, 
 although I will only be in the office Monday through Wednesday.  Feel free to 
 move forward with whatever you need to do.  I trust that I will have several 
 good candidates to consider, and Patti is doing a great job, also.  I need to 
 find out if she would like to  be considered for the fulltime position.
