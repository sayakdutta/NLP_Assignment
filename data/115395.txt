 
 Beginning tomorrow this report will contain Inter-Continental Exchange (ICE)  
 trade numbers and volumes, in addition to EOL and brokered deal information. 
 Please look for that information at the beginning of the e-mail. Also note 
 that the ICE data is released one day later, so it will not correlate 
 directly to the EOL data below it. (i.e. Daily EOL Summary 3/1 will include 
 ICE data from 2/28) Enjoy...
