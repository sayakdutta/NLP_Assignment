 	Thanks for your message. First, I hope your son's ok. His health is obviously the top priority. Hopefully, he'll get better soon.
 
 	I'm available for lunch on either Wednesday or Friday of this week. There's no hurry in pinning down a date or time now. Just let me know when it's convenient. I'm also available next week.
 
 	Take care.
