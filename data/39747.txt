 We have recently been talking to a gentleman named Ed Straub at Duke.  I'll
 see if I can push him perhaps by telling them they can speak in Houston if
 they join up?
 
 I also spoke with Constellation Energy today and they are serious about
 joining as a Primary.  I might even be able to have their application by
 next week's Board meeting.
 
 Sorry if I asked you this before, but do you or anyone at Enron know Powder
 Horn Petroleum Company out of Tulsa, OK?  They have applied as a Subscriber.
 
 Thanks.
 Mary

 I am actively pursuing have Duke Energy become an ISDA member this month.
 We are very interested in supporting the effort you mentioned at the
 October meeting to begin developing one universal master energy trading
 form.  Please keep me informed of future meetings, to insure our active
 participation as this effort develops.  Thanks.
