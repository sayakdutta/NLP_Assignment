 In order for the Enron Performance Review process to work effectively, it is 
 essential that employees receive written performance evaluations. The 
 attached list indicates Associates and Analysts in your business unit for 
 whom we have not received written YE2000 performance evaluations.  Thank you 
 for your attention to this matter.  If you need any additional information 
 please do not hesitate to contact me.
