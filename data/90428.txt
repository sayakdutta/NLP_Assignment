 Here is some information that you probably are already aware of, but just in
 case......
 
 You may recall that Com Ed sold all of their coal-fired units and gas fired
 units to EME (Edison Mission Energy). I don't remember exactly how many
 megawatts are now owned and controlled by Mission, but it is between 15,000
 and 20,000 MW throughout Northern Illinois.   Mission's union has authorized
 a strike to be effective June 1.  Unlike Peoples, Mission does not have many
 management employees in the Chicago area (Mission is a California-based
 corporation).  Therefore the odds of the plants remaining in operation
 during a strike are low.  They would likely keep a couple of key plants on,
 and the rest would idle.
 
 Power prices currently do not support operation of Allegheny or
 Constellation, but a large outage may change that.  Bill Quigley has some
 good contacts that have been keeping him up to date on the status of this.
 If they strike we may see Allegheny, Constellation and Elwood fire even when
 weather is not extreme.
