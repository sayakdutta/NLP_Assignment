 I don't remember being consulted about sending these documents by e-mail (but 
 that doesn't mean it didn't happen - just that I don't remember it).  It 
 sounds like a valid concern - any reason we can't just send people to the web 
 site and ask them to print out the relevant PA?

 Mark -
 Now that my responsibilities have been increased to include both EnronOnline 
 and Clickpaper, something was brought to my attention that I am concerned 
 about.  Clickpaper has been instructed not to send password applications to 
 customers via e-mail.  This is something we have been doing since the 
 inception of EnronOnline.  The concern is that customers will alter the 
 language in the agreement, sign  and return it to us - hopefully, this will 
 not happen, but could be a valid concern.  I am hoping you can shed some 
 light on the original decision that was made to allow sending the PAs to 
 customers electronically.  One solution that we could implement in the future 
 is to send the file to the customer in .pdf format; however, the customer 
 will need the applicable software to launch the program (we could include a 
 link to download this).  The immediate solution is to discontinue this 
 practice until I have discussed it with you.  I know you are out of the 
 office until Monday, and I am out the rest of the week as well.  Please let 
 me know your thoughts when you return.
 
 Thanks!
 Sheri
