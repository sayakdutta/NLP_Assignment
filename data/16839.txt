 good bad or indifferent.  McFadden is one of the Manifesto signers and a 
 Nobel Laureate.  If folks have comments, please forward them along and I will 
 get them into the mix.  Thanks a bunch.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 I have prepared a statement on the California energy crisis in response to
 a solicitation from the Wall Street Journal, and attach a preliminary first
 draft in pdf and Wordperfect formats.  This may or may not appear in some
 edited form as an op-ed piece in the WSJ.  Although this statement is in
 my own words, I believe it is consistent with the Manifesto.  I would
 appreciate feedback from my fellow economists if I have made statements that
 contradict the Manifesto, or most critically have made arguments that they
 feel are not sound economics.  I will try to incorporate suggestions in the
 next draft.  Thanks for your reaction.
 
 I am also sending copies of this draft to a couple of people in the media
 other than the WSJ, and they are welcome to use the content but not the text
 if they want a summary of my take on the crisis.
