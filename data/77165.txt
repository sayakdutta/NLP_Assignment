 
 Karen,
 
 It appears to me that this version of the document allocates a new risk to 
 Enron:  risk of damage to a certain road during construction.  It would seem 
 that the responsibility to repair it should be limited to damage done as a 
 result of the construction.  Also, it is unclear as written as to whether we 
 can repair it ourselves, or whether the City fixes it and sends us the bill.  
 What is the intent?
 
 Thank you,
 
 Kay
 
 
 
 
 
 


 
  
 Kay:  As Mark Gershon mentioned in his email, we are wrapping up the
 Yorkville Annexation Agreement.  For your benefit, I have forwarded to you
 by fax (to fax number 713-646-3491) an additional copy of the final revised
 Annexation Agreement for your review and approval.  As  I mentioned in the
 fax coversheet, upon your approval, I will substitute the original signature
 pages from teh previously executed version with the final version.  We had
 previously received approval from teh Konicek's to do the same with their
 original signature pages.  Thanks and please call with any questions or
 comments.
