 Sorry for the delay in getting back to you, but you know how things are. I have tried to get someone in the NPC to talk to me but to no avail. I will keep trying but don't hold out much chance...
 
 A big Mazel Tov on the engagement ! Married life is the way to go. 
 
 I heard about Sonny. Oh well...i didn't really know him that well so i can't say if that was a loss or not.
 
 I heard Alex is now with Allegheny Power, although I assume that is in NYC not Hagerstown, MD.
 
 Take care and give me a call...(713) 853 6994
