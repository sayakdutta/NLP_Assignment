 Charlie,  I just wanted to say thanks for coming down to watch the kids
 even though both of the games were cancelled.  It meant a lot that
 you'll made the attempt.  We really enjoyed having you and I hope we can
 continue to get together on a more regular basis without the rest of the
 world with us.  It is nice for Melissa and I to have time to visit and
 it is nice for the kids to get to know each other and to have a
 relationship.  I am going to teach Blake how to wrap his legs around my
 waist when I carry him - I am looking forward to the birth of my
 nephew.  Love, Margaret
