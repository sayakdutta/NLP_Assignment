 Celeste,
 
 It seems that the process lasted too long for some students
 and only Kim Whitsel is interested in the internship at this point.
 
 Her resume has been forwarded to you.
 I am enclosing it just in case.
 Thanks for your help.

 Vince:
 
 Thank you to you, Ken and Christie for coming to campus for the Enron Tiger
 Team Mid-Project review.  The students are working hard and appreciate your
 insight and suggestions to the project.  Thank you for your support of the
 Wharton School.
 

 that she is very much interested in a summer internship at Enron this year.
 
 I don't believe some of the students understood the process you had setup
 for them at Enron as part of the Tiger Team. Being concerned with having
 summer employment, they interviewed with other firms and ultimately accepted
 positions. The students asked that I express to you that this does not mean
 they are not interested in full time work at Enron next year.  I apologize
 and take responsibility for the lack of communication in this regard.  I
 think it is a lesson learned and perhaps, in the future, we can make the
 agreement to students understood in advance of their "dedicated interview
 week" and eliminate their need to interview at all. This can also be an
 added advantage of applying to be a member of the Tiger Team.
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions and exactly how Kim Whitsel
 should proceed.
 
 
 Thank you,
