 it has already come and gone!
 
 Just wondering if you still have your unused KLM ticket for the 
 Istanbul/Amsterdam/Nairobi leg of the trip.  That is a refundable ticket, so 
 if you would return it to me I can get Jeff's card credited for the charge - 
 I believe it's in the neighborhood of $2,000.  If you have it, just drop it 
 in the mail to:

 Thanks and take care,
