 
 I'd like to inquire about the Dow Jones index price database currently being 
 maintained by the Fundamentals group. It's come to my attention - by virtue 
 of the fact that I receive the Dow Jones data each afternoon - that several 
 people are interested in having access to those figures. I've had requests 
 from mid-marketing, trading, and scheduling, and am working with IT to put 
 the NP-15 and SP-15 data online. Cara Semperger, in particular, relies on the 
 index prices in order to run one of her reports.
 
 I'm wondering if it  would be possible to give these people access to your 
 database, or maybe if your group would benefit from the data I receive. Your 
 spreadsheet looks like a compilation of the documents I receive from Dow 
 Jones, and one might be more useful for an individual or group than the 
 other. I don't have a preference either way - I'm more than happy to compile 
 the reports in a separate folder. Please let me know what works best for you. 
 (I sit in the middle of the room between Tracy Ngo and Val Sabo.)
 
 Thanks,
 Kate
