 
 Just FYI - This should cut down on the paper trail a bit.

 Kate,
 
 I was not aware that it was being faxed.  I found out that T Jae Black on the 
 East Trading desk was faxing it.  I went ahead and contacted her to let her 
 know that there was not necessary.  You should receive an updated Credit 
 Watchlist every Monday.  Please email me if you don't receive it.
 
 Thanks,
 Veronica

 I was just told that we are being sent the Credit Watchlist Update via fax, 
 in addition to the one you send me via e-mail every couple weeks or so. Since 
 I already receive and print out the list for all of our traders and 
 mid-marketers, I thought it might cut down on some work for someone if they 
 didn't have to fax it to us as well. I don't know if that person is you, or 
 if you might know who I can contact; in any case, Iwe don't need the 
 watchlist faxed to the Portland office. (Anything to take one extra step out 
 of the day, right?)
 
 Please let me know if I should contact somebody else.
 
 Thanks so much,
 Kate
