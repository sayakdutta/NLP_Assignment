 Once there, click the "e-cards" link, then scroll to the bottom of the page 
 to find "pick up a greeting". Click that link and it will ask for your e-mail 
 address and retrieval number.  Your retrieval number is

 This e-card will be available for 90 days.  If you'd like to send one back, 
 use the "send your own greeting" button beside the e-card.  Enjoy!
