  On the 12/11 MPR to be issued on 12/12, we will be taking a $56 million loss 
 on Catalytica Energy Systems.  This asset will begin trading on the open 
 market either Friday, 12/15 or Monday, 12/18 under the ticker CESIV.  The 
 potential trading range of $10 - $20 per share is disclosed in the company's 
 S-1.  This asset is in Raptor I and therefore this write-down will exhaust 
 $56 M of the remaining Raptor I capacity.
