 Can we convert the draft into cash and still maintain our security interest?  
 If not, can we get the bank to somehow guarantee that the funds will be there 
 - in the US that would require either certification by the bank of the 
 customer's draft or the issuance of an actual bank or cashier's check.

 Greg Johnston may have a solution to the limitation on Canadian cash 
 collateral.  Without getting into detail, a security interest in an 
 "instrument" can be perfected by possession under the Personal Property 
 Security Act, and an "instrument" includes a bank draft.  If counterparties 
 were to provide bank drafts on the same terms as they provide LCs we could 
 rely on perfection by possession.  Is this something we should investigate 
 further?  Peter.
