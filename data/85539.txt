 
 We settled up on the tix.  You gave me some cash.  We're good.
 
 I have never been to Acapulco.  The only place on the Pacific side I have 
 been to is Cabo.  Most people that have been to Acapulco really like it 
 though.
 
 Don't worry about the end of the evening.  Strange things always happen at 6 
 am after we have been up all night.  Forget about it.  Have fun in 
 Mississippi.

 I know we talked about it, but did I ever pay you for the UT/A&M tickets
 Friday night?  If not, send me your address and I'll drop a check in the
 mail to you since I'll be out of town much of the rest of the year.
 
 Speaking of which, have you ever been to Acapulco?  Cyndi and I are going
 there for Christmas.  If you've been, let me know if you have any
 recommendations for things to do down there.
 
 Thanks again for going the other night.  Hope I didn't make you too
 uncomfortable at the end of the evening.  A little too much alcohol there
 at the end of the evening.
