 Just wanted everyone to know that Texas was voted #1 by Playboy magazine for
 "Colleges with the Best Looking Girls".  As if we needed affirmation of this
 fact...
 
 But, now, we have full-fledged proof to show the world where it's at.
 
 I've never been prouder to say, "Hook 'em Horns!!"
 
 This comes from playboy.com

 1.  The University of Texas
 2.  Arizona State
 3.  UCLA
 4.  University of Florida
 5.  University of Arizona
 6.  Florida State
