 
 We need to get copies of the merger documents.  Depending of the nature of 
 the merger, we may or may not agree to it, as our document allows, and if we 
 do, we need to determine the impact on our credit.  Can you provide a copy to 
 me and Tanya Rohauer in Credit as soon as we receive the merger documents.  
 
 Thanks for the "head up".

 Please let me know if someone in SAP is already working with EOL on this and, 
 if so, the status.
 
 Thank you,

 heads up
 
 Effective February 1, 2001, Koch Energy Trading and Entergy Power Marketing 
 will be merging.  The new name will be Axia Energy Trading.  I have left a 
 voice mail for Karen to call the customer with details of what Enron requires 
 to accomplish this change in our systems.  I also conferenced Vikkie Karel 
 (Koch Energy  -- 713-544-5269) with Walter for clarification of the parties 
 that are merging.
 
 Regarding EOL users from both companies, is there a way that the customer can 
 keep IDs/filters/etc. and move to the new name? OR, will new IDs need to be 
 created?  ===== this is for you, Stephanie
