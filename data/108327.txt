 
 thanks.  are there any other companys that make a substitutable connector?  
 Meaning, do they (Amp) have any competitors of any sort?  I appreciate the 
 insights.

 Jeff,
 
 The company that makes the connectors for the 12 pair cable is called "Amp".  
 They make both the existing and the substitute connector.
