 Lindy Donoho (P# 505520) erroneously had 12/27-28 & 12/31 coded as vacation,
 although she did not take them.
 
 Therefore, please add 26 hours to her 2002 available vacation balance.
 
 Let me know if you have any questions.
 
 Thanks,

 Please add 26 hours to Lindy Donoho, p505520 2002 vacation carryover.  26 hours were incorrectly coded last year as vacation, which was not taken.
