 Dear Vince
 ?
 I would like to invite you to Chair the stream on  Energy and Corporate risk 
 management at the GARP Convention. Is this something  that would be of 
 interest to you?
 ?
 Also, can I please confirm, because I am having a  few IT problems at 
 present, that the following title is correct for  you:
  
 
 Vince Kaminski, Managing Director, Research, Enron  Corp.
 I look forward to your response in due course.
 ?
 Kind regards
 ?
 Andreas
