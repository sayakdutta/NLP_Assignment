 guys you need to talk to.  Steve Harris is VP of marketing at TW, and Kevin 
 Hyatt is his right hand guy.  Steve is at 713-853-1796 and I'm not sure what 
 Hyatt's # is.  Give me a call and I'll tell you what I can about what we're 
 doing to help site power plants.  When did you go out-house?  I don't think 
 I've run into you since you were running around with Shoneman.  Adios, DF.  
 
 
 
 

   
  
 
 
 Drew;
 Congratulations on your new job.? I didn't realize that you had joined  the 
 pipelines.
 I've got a client interested in developing a power plant in Arizona off  
 Transwestern.? Can you give me a good contact at Transwestern?
 Regards,
 George Briden
