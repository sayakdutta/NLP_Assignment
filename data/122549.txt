 
 Steve, 
 
 We are still confirming whether or not TW has had other I to I deals negotiated in the past.  So far, TK, Lorraine and Michelle don't think that we have any, but I will talk to Lindy tomorrow.  Here are some NNG I to I neg. rates that have been approved during the past year.  
 
 I will keep you posted. 
 
 Kim.

 Kim - in the past year, Ranelle & I found 4 Negotiated Rate deals involving index differentials in the past year.
 All were approved.  I cut & pasted relevant sections for NNG tariff sheets (the complete sheets are in the Current & Superseded sections under NNG's Informational Postings-Tariff on the EBB)
 
 I don't have the docket number for the first one with Midamerican Energy, 1/2000.
 The others are:
 RP96-272-016 8/1/2001 Dynegy marketing
 RP96-272-024 1/1/2001 Oneok & Aquila
   (Tariff sheet dated 1/16/2001 - there was apparently some other change after the initial filing)
 RP96-272-029 4/1/2001 MIdAmerican Energy
