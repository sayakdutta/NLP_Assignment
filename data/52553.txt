 I don't see any problems with #1. For number 2, mention that the paper was written when you were a studentt
 at Rice.

 Vince,
 
 A couple of brief issues:
 
 1) I have been asked to deliver a lecture(s) to a Rice environmental engineering class in the fall.  Most of the preparatory work for the class is already complete, so I don't foresee any large time commitment for this endeavor.  If there is a problem, let me know.
 
 2) A manuscript based on my dissertation work was recently accepted for publication by ASCE Journal of Environmental Engineering.  I would like to use my Enron address and contact information on the work, but am unsure of company policies.  I can certainly default to the Rice information if there is a problem.
