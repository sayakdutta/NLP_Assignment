 According to Enpower Annuity #551808, EES was last billed in March for their $35,000/month scheduling fee.  An annuity should now be entered by Short Term California for April through September scheduling services.  Also, going forward, Short Term California will be responsible for entering in the monthly annuity.
 
 Thanks,
