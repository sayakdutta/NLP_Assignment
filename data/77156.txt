 Hello - In order to cross one more item off of the enovate setup list, I 
 would like to pursue the initial capital contribution required under the LLC 
 agreement of $100,000 from each member.  Although we do not have loan 
 facilities in place or final cash management protocol, I believe the initial 
 funding can still take place.  If anyone has any other thoughts please let me 
 know.  If not, I would like to schedule the initial funding for Friday, 
 October 6th.  I believe that Mary Lynne will prepare the necessary vouchers 
 and journal entries.  I am assuming that Enron MW, L.L.C., as Member, will be 
 funding enovate, L.L.C.  Does ENA then fund Enron MW, L.L.C.? (Kay? Mary 
 Lynne?)  
 
 As an update - Peoples' Board meets next Wednesday, Oct. 4th to approve the 
 risk management policy.  Assuming approval, enovate will be free to transact 
 with third parties.  Therefore, depending on payment terms, money will begin 
 flowing through the enovate account.  Therefore, any loan docs and service 
 agreements should be in place by the second week of October.
 
 Any thoughts, please let me know.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Gregg
