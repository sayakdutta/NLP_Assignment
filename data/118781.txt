 Thanks for your note.  Just to keep you posted - I plan to be there with my 
 boat but will return to my slip at Kemah Harbor and drive over to the party 
 so I won't add to the size of your raft.

  Hi, folks.
  All of you have expressed an intent to bring your boats out to meet
 New World on Saturday.  It's looking like we have about 32 boats coming out.
 We're hoping to raft together as many as possible off the restaurant's dock.
 I know some of you who have your own slips nearby will be taking your boats
 home and driving over to the party.
  But we've had one skipper mention that he wouldn't be willing to
 raft together with others out of fear for his thin, wooden hull.  We've
 secured him a nearby slip, and we could come up with a few more if we must.
 If for any reason you believe you cannot raft together with the other boats,
 please let me know immediately, and I'll see what I can do.
  Also, if you haven't seen the plan (updated today), please visit

  Thanks.  And we'll see you on Saturday.
