 Matt,
 I like the Mcleod Resume the best. I have added some suggestions and provided a bit of feedback. Why don't you do another write-up and I'll go over it again. It looks like you have a good start. I will also proofread your cover letter or give you some ideas if you need them.
 Good luck.
 
 Bill
