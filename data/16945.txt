 
 Great to see you guys, and despite all the excitement, it was alot of fun.  
 Hope that you made it back safely.  Couple of things:
 
 I'd like to talk to several vineyard consultants, so if it ain't too much 
 trouble, and you've got a name, I'd love to check around.
 Can I order two cases of coastal zin?
 What about the champagne?  How much per magnum is it?
 
 Best,
 Jeff
