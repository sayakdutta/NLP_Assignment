 It is not in the agreement. just a question. 
 
  
     
 We decide to leave out the $ value in order to focus them on the structure.  I do not see the conversation about option values on the pipe?
 
  
     
 I thought we were going to show them a number to work with.... What is this conversation about option values on the pipe?
