 <<<<Cover Letter>>>>
 
 I would like to express my interest in the "Energy Trader" position posted in the Houston Chronicle, Sunday, December 2, 2001.
 
 I have been trading power at Enron for the U.S. Eastern Interconnect and am very familiar with all facets of executing hourly and daily trades, including the utilization of trading tools and indices for all energy commodities.
 
 I have over nine years of related experience and have also received my MBA during my four-year tenure at Enron.  My experience ranges from petroleum terminal management, refining and wholesale marketing, fuel management, pipeline and vessel/barge scheduling; liquefied natural gas (LNG); and trading power for the U.S. Eastern Interconnect power grid.
 
 My attached resume illustrates an intense level of vertically integrated experience and knowledge of the energy business.  I believe that my vast experience and advanced education could be of great benefit to your company.
 
 I would appreciate the opportunity to discuss career options with someone at your company.
 
 Sincerely,
