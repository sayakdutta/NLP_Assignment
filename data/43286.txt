 xception being granted.
 
 









































  
  
 I would like to pursue an offer to Mr. Shea prior to the next Executive Com=
 mittee meeting on May 7, 2001.  Please forward your comments or questions b=
 y Tuesday, May 1, 2001 so that I can extend the offer by Wednesday, May 2, =
 2001.
 
 You will find attached the recommendation letter and his resume.
