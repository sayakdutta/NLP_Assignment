 
 Tom,
 
 Here are the new graphs with totals (bar charts) and distributions (boxplots) 
 for all seven sites through May 2002. 
 
 I believe that I have come up with a method of providing you with the 
 ESTIMATED energy lost. Since it requires using two data sets (faults and 
 10-minute data) it will be take a bit longer to run. However I hope to have 
 that result to you next week. 
 
 Mark
