 Thanks for WSJ article.  Now if only you could notify senior management over 
 here and let them know I would forever indebted (but hopefully richer as 
 well).
 
 TVA has sent us a system impact study agreement that I am having faxed to you 
 now.  We have to send out on Thursday.  Do you have time to review and we can 
 discuss tomorrow. 
 
  Thanks
