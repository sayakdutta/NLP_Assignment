 To our Valued Palm.Net Customers:
 
 Please read this in its entirety, you will not incur a charge for the receipt 
 of

 the service unavailable for approximately 12-hours starting Sat., Dec. 9 at

 PST/11pm EST, and ending at 4am PST/ 7am EST on Sun., Dec. 10. During that 
 time,
 if you try to "check and send" or "get more" you will receive an error message
 saying "Server Busy" tap details for more information". The details box will
 state  "The iMessenger server is temporarily unavailable due to system

 takes longer than expected, service will remain unavailable and we'll post
 periodic updates to the www.palm.net Network Status page, with a plan to be up
