 Ok. No time frame we are just hanging in there and just waiting like most people.  
 I already have an offer from a law firm and I'm waiting to hear back from Baylor College of Medicine for
 the second interview.  So I know I will find something, I just wasn't ready to leave here yet.  Let me know
 when you are least busy today and I'll come by.

 Have they given you guys any time frame?  I am up on five, you get a chance, stop by.

 I'm in the new building as well.  We were on of the first groups to move in back Oct.  I'm on 4.
 My group is definitely out the door.  Credit Trading is the name of my group and I think the name speaks for
 itself....  
 
  
     
 good idea coming back.  It is a zoo around here.  Looks like D-Day is today.  We will see.  At least I got to move into the new building and see it for a few days.  Where are you currently sitting?

 I came back the 5th of this month because of what is going on.  I was planning on staying out till Dec. but I figured I better get in here and get my resume updated.  
 The baby is doing great, thanks for asking.
 I was just bugging like always.
