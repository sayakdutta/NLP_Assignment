 You are correct, JBLOCK got longer 495K barrels.  However, crude is a huge=
 =20
 hedge component on this deal and net crude position for Liquids is short.
 As you can see on the Component VaR graph, with the short position in crude=

 it is eating up most of Agg-Liquids VaR.  Therefore, putting on any long=20
 position in products (this includes LPG's) would act as a hedge. =20

 how did it reduce var if we added to the underlying positions?
 
 
    
 JBlock does take up some of the VaR for Agg-Liquids; however, it is not a=

 contributor of VaR violation for effective date Nov. 6.  As matter of fact,=

 the VaR for JBlock went down.  The component VaR graph below shows that=20
 heating oil was a hedge but no longer as of yesterday.  Gasoil is still a=

 hedge for Agg-Liquids but the hedge is reduced.   =20

 The violation was due to heating and gasoil going shorter by 939K barrels. =
