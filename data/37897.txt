 pos of 269.55 lots, but TDS is showing 539.1.  False alarm.  We will fix 
 newcurrentday.

 The PG&E basis position in TDS does not match the FEB/MAR position.  The Baja 
 spread was executed as a NOV-MAR position months ago. The only real changes 
 were to Socal basis over time. There is no telling when this might have 
 changed in error.  Will you please research the position to see when this 
 position was reduced.  I am guessing that a park and loan was executed by 
 Frank Ermis at some point and the basis risk was allocated to GD New by 
 mistake.  
 
 Thanks,
 Mike
