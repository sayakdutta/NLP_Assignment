 The Associate & Analyst Programs are please to present you with the 
 opportunity to attend one of the first four Astro's games in Enron Field.  
 There are a limited number of tickets, therefore the tickets will be given 
 away through a lottery system.  Program Management will draw names on 
 Wednesday, March 29 and the lottery winners will be notified by 4:00 p.m. of 
 the same day.
 
 The Lottery rules are as follows:
 You are limited to two (2) tickets.  You may submit your name for all 4 
 games.  However, you are only eligible to receive tickets to one game.  We 
 must have your reply by 2:00 p.m.  Due to the short time frame replies 
 received after 2:00 p.m. cannot be considered.
