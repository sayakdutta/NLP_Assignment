 Sara,
 Attached is the EOL Amendment that Stacy Dickson has already prepared for Texaco and sent to Mark.  Power does not need to see it as stated below since Power does not do any business with Texaco.  Can you incorporate your financial comments into the version below?

 Mark, 
 Attached is an EOL Amendment for the Texaco entities.  EPMI does not trade power with Texaco so Janet does not need to see this amendment.
