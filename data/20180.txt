 
 Thank you very much for your kind voicemail.  Unfortunately for Gov't Affairs, unless Steve and Rick have other plans, you all are stuck with me since I love working for Enron (even in California!).  Bizarre rumor, the origins of which baffle me....
 
 Thanks again for the sweet voicemail.  And holy moly, sounds like you and Christi are going to be extremely busy at FERC.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
