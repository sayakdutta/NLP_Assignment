 
 Kerry, this is the second of two messages.   Do you have any thoughts?

 Michelle  - Can you review the following examples as well?  USO means 
 unscheduled overtime, UPG means upgrade and the UO1 means Upgrade Overtime.
 If I should be forwarding these to someone else, please let me know.
 
 Thanks,
 Diane

 See answers below in blue.  Shawn - can you please review as well.  The first

 Diane,
 
 I.  We need help with the following:
 
 1) Employee works night shift  (12 SH2)
      Same employee is on an upgrade (12 UPG)
      Same employee works overtime
 
 What would the overtime entry look like, and what would be the rate 
 computation for the above employee?  
 
 Assumptions:
 
 A Rate $3949.57 $22.79/hour
 B Rate $4234.00 $24.43/hour
 SH2   $1/hr
 UO1 $350  $   5.40/hour (I am assuming a 88 hour period)
 UPG $350  $   2.19/hour (I am assuming a 88 hour period)
 
 
   W F S S
 
 REG   12 12 12
 SH2  N N N N
 UPG  12 12 12 12 
 USO  12
 UO1  12  
 
 It is my understanding that we would need to add the $48 ($1/hr) of shift pay 
 to the regular rate of pay ($24.43/hr) to obtain his regular rate of pay 
 ($25.53).  His USO would then be paid at $457.74 (12 x 25.43 x 1.5).
 
 The UO1 would be calculated at $64.80 (5.40x12).
 
 Second example for this scenario:
 
 A Rate $3949.57 $22.79/hour
 B Rate $4234.00 $24.43/hour
 SH2   $1/hr
 UO1 $350  $   5.40/hour (I am assuming a 88 hour period)
 UPG $350  $   2.19/hour (I am assuming a 88 hour period)
 
 
   W F S S
 
 REG   12 12 12
 SH2  N N N N 
 UPG  12 12 
 USO  12    2
 UO1  12       
 
 It is my understanding that we would need to add the $48 ($1/hr) of shift pay 
 to the regular rate of pay ($24.43/hr) to obtain his regular rate of pay 
 ($25.53).  His USO would then be paid at $457.74 (12 x 25.43 x 1.5).
 
 The UO1 would be calculated at $64.80 (5.40x12).
 
 The USO would be calculated at $76.59 (25.53x1.5x2 hours)
 
 
 
 2)  Employee works night shift
       Same employee works overtime
 
      Does the overtime rate take shift differential into account?
 
      We've got timesheets that show an employee who worked on a night shift 
 for 12 hours.  This was the employee's off day.
 
      The code was 12 SH2 (for night shift)
                                    12 USO (for overtime)
 
       Are these time entries correct? Yes.  What would be the rate 
 computation for the above employee?
 
 
 The overtime would need to account for the shift differential.  For the week 
 in question Jan 17-23 he has the following hours:
 
   W F S S
 
 REG   12 12 12 
 SH2  N N N N 
 USO  12 
                                      
 This ees salary is as follows:
 
 A Rate $3949.57 $22.79/hour
 B Rate $4234.00 $24.43/hour
 
 It is my understanding that we would need to add the $48 ($1/hr) of shift pay 
 to the regular rate of pay ($24.43/hr) to obtain his regular rate of pay 
 ($25.53).  His USO would then be paid at $457.74 (12 x 25.43 x 1.5).
