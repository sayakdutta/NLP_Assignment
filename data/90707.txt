 Glad to hear that you are doing well.
 Sorry so late on this, I have used ALtra , TransEnergy , and Risk Works.
 Enron uses all self built risk programs. 
 I have also heard good things about Crystal Ball but do not know much about it.
 
 I hope all is well

 Hi Dutch,
 How are you doing this lovely day? I am doing good. Pretty busy. I have got SO many projects on my table. It is good, cause the day goes by quicker now. Anyways, I had a question for you. One of my new projects is to find a good software that my group can use that does risk management, real time updates, some forecasting, etc... Basically, do you guys use any kinds of software (besides the in-house stuff) that I can research ?
 
 I know its bid week, so just get back to when when you get a chance! Thanks!! I hope that you are making some money there... STock price sucks right now!
 
 Purvi
