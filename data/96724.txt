 
 I've spent the past 2 hours exploring each and every post office in the 
 armpit of southwest Houston (Enron advice) looking to simply renew my pasport 
 only to be intimidated by the words "no less than a 4 hour wait"   (on hard 
 floors) .
 
 Any advice?  Your experience certainly must have been better.
 
 Sad I am.
