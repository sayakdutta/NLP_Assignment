 
 Anyway, Ann isn't coming on Friday because she can't stand it that everyone 
 is a couple, so she is going instead with her ex boyfriend  to a dinner party 
 given by some people she doesn't even know.  Although I am trying very hard 
 to be understanding, I'm not doing a very good job.  When I was in her 
 situation, I seem to remember enjoying my best friends' company whether I had 
 a date or not!  But that's just me.  
 
 Hope you are still having tanning weather in Austin.  We certainly are here.  
 If you feel you are not getting enough color for your trip to Cabo, I'll come 
 before you leave and help you with the Clinique Tan-In-A-Tube!  (You will 
 still have to wear sunscreen).  What are your trip dates again?
 
 Have a good day!
 
 Love, 
 Sooz
