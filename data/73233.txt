 I've been working on the letter, but I've got to fill in a bunch of blanks 
 before it is finished (proper names, etc.)  Depends on how complete you want 
 it to be.
 
 I've got to check to see if this is the final version we agreed to.  It is 
 very close.

 Kay:
 
 I'd like to call Jeff Darst today to discuss the letter he sent on LDs, etc. 
 Prior to calling him, though, I wanted to e-mail the acknowledgement letter 
 and the acknowledgement and consent. I was wondering if you could provide me 
 an electronic copy of the acknowledgement and consent, and a draft letter. 
 Let me know when you think you can get to this, and I'll schedule the call 
 with Darst accordingly.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Ben
