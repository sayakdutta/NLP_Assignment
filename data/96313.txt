 
 Attached is revised draft that incorporates all of PG&E's earlier comments 
 and is marked to show my proposed revisions. Please review and let me know if 
 you have any comments.  If possible, we should send back to PG&E today.  
 Several Letters of Credit are soon to expire and we will otherwise need to 
 provide substitute Letters by the 11th.  
 
 
 As always, thanks for everyone's help.
