 
 Susan,  
 
 Under the terms of the Gallup Compression Services Agreement, ECS is working 
 with the electric utility (Tri-State) to provide TW access to Tri-State's web 
 site for the purposes of load controlling the Gallup Station to avoid 
 Tri-State's system peaks.  Attached is a confidentiality agreement which 
 Tri-State drafted under which Tri-State will allow both TW and ECC to see 
 such data.  Tri-State is obviously concerned with migration of the data to 
 Enron's power trading groups.  The attached draft includes my comments.  I 
 have attached a clean and a redlined of my comments.  I thought we could get 
 both of our comments prior to sending back to Tri-State.  Please review and 
 return all your comments to me.  Thanks.
