 
 Attached is a rough draft of my talking points for a panel I'll be on at a 
 CEM conference in SF on Thursday afternoon.  Have distributed to Western GA 
 team (plus Steffes) for comment and thought you may have some, too.  
 
 Topic for panel, "PUC Priorities."  Goal is to (politely?) refute Loretta 
 Lynch's and Carl Woods' continued assertions that 1) California's move to 
 deregulate was based solely on ideology with no basis in fact and 2) the 
 solution is to turn back the clock to command-and-control regulation.  
 
 The FERC order tomorrow is likely to alter the points somewhat.  
 
 Comments are much appreciated.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
