 
 Aruba-Sply is an active book, there are just a few deals and there are two with external counterparties.

 Keith -
 
 Anything in risktrac that is "-PHY" is intra-month.  Anything with "-PRC",  "-BAS", "-IDX", "-GDI",  are all "term" books.  There are some rules around "-GDL" where it is intra-month for all but two days at the end of each month.
 
 The OIL-NG (Lavo's) book would only have internal deals.  That may be why his book is not in credit.  Not really sure what the deal is with ARUBA-SPLY.  You should probably give Phillip Love a call.

 I'm looking with the AGG-CREDIT portfolio to determine if the portfolio content is complete/correct.  In doing a comparison between AGG-CREDIT and AGG-PROD-DPR-BU, the following books are shown as active in AGG-PROD but not included in CREDIT.  Any thoughts on whether or not these should be included/excluded?  Based on the book id, I assume they are not intramonth - thus should likely be included.  
 
 ARUBA-SPLY-PRC	US Gas Central		
 OIL-NG-HDG-C-CA-GDL	US GAS Financial		
 
 Separately I heard that there are books labeled as intramonth that include forward positions & vice versa forward books that contain intramonth positions.  Do you have a listing of these?
 
 Thanks
