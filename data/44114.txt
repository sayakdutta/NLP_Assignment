  You know the answer.  Can you call the central desk for the price for spot 
 gas to be sold to Heartland.  I spoke with Sylvia Pollan and she was to get 
 back to me.
 
 Charles,
  Can you redo the statement for physical gas through the 23rd and include a 
 line item for the Mark-to-market true-up value as a result of the termination 
 triggered by their bankruptcy filing.  Jason R Williams of the Credit group 
 was to redo the termination payment amount.

 Dan - can we apply this amount to prepetition gas.  Unfortunately, I do not 
 think we can?  Please advise.

 John,  FYI - Heartland made a $63,000 payment yesterday.  The total credit 
 for them now is $308,940.12.
