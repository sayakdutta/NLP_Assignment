 Ian,
  
 When I said spread I didn't mean graph the basis as opposed to the fixed price (these graphs are essentially identical to the first ones you did) I want a graph of the relationship (spread) between the 2 points. i.e. if Nov-Mar Sumas was marked at 0.20 and Nov-Mar Aeco was marked at (0.45) the Nov-Mar Sumas Aeco spread would be 0.65. Sorry if I wasn't clear. Call me with any ?s.

 Chris,
  
 Here is the update using the spreads instead of the fixed price.  The worksheet is titled "Sumas Basis Graphs".

 Getting closer. I want a graph of the spread not of the 2 fixed prices.

  Chris,
  
 Here is the updated information you wanted.  The charts can be found in the "Sumas Graphs" worksheet.

 Ian,
  
 Thanx looks good. What I was really looking for was the relationship between Sumas and each of those points for the N-M and A-O strips.
  
 Can you put these graphs together for me.
  
 Nov-Mar
 Sumas vs. Aeco
 Sumas vs. Rockies
 Sumas vs. San Juan
 Sumas vs. Malin
 Sumas vs. Socal
  
 Apr-Oct
 Sumas vs. Aeco
 Sumas vs. Rockies
 Sumas vs. San Juan
 Sumas vs. Malin
 Sumas vs. Socal
