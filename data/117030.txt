 
 I'm in Buenos Aires today and talked to Andrea about her computer.  While 
 they are having big problems with her laptop (it likes to eat hard drives) 
 she will be able to bring it along (it's a Compaq Armada 1500C - will that 
 fit in the docking station?).  In case it isn't working, can we get her set 
 up with one of the Windows 2000 machines that are being installed Tuesday 
 morning?

 She can use EB3891 and the extension for that office is 5-7780.   For the 
 next 2 weeks.  Please advise her to bring her own laptop.  There is an 
 "empty" docking station available in EB3891 for her use.

 Good morning, girls.
 
 Did you know that Andrea Calo, attorney from the Argentina office, is coming 
 to the Houston office on Monday morning , May 1, for a two week stay?
 
 At Mark Taylor's request, please arrange an office, computer, and phones for 
 her.  I will reserve an temporary ID for her through security.  Regarding her 
 computer, she will let me know later this a.m. if she will be traveling with 
 her lap top.
 
 Please let me know if you need any additional information.  Sorry for the 
 short notice, I just found out.
 
 Thank you,
 Taffy
