 
 We just opened the above counterparty to trade UK financial crude products 
 online.  Since the Enron counterparty for these products is ECTRIC we will 
 need to get a master in place between ECTRIC and Counterparty.  Justin Boyd 
 in London has graciously agreed to let us handle drafting and negotiation of 
 the master.  Could you please provide us with credit for this master.  I 
 don't know if we can just mirror the credit terms in the old master or not.  
 Since the old master is a Local Currency Master, we cannot do a simple dupe 
 and change it for UK issues.  I would suggest unless we really have problems 
 with issues, we more or less try to sign the same paper whenever possible.
 
 Of course, send the credit worksheet for the new master to the paralegals for 
 the rotation.
