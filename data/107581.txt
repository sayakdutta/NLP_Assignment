 Dear Mr. Shankman,
 ? How are you doing? We met last week at the  undergraduate Enron 
 presentation and discussed the possibility of an Enron/ESPN  deal that would 
 enable television viewers to order old sporting events over the  television 
 (similar to the Blockbuster deal). You told me to send you an email  around 
 this time to follow up, so I can find out who to contact to get the ball  
 rolling. Thanks again for taking the time to listen to my idea.
 ?
 Sincerely,
 Zachary Costello
