 That is good
 
  
     
 How's 11:30 or so Nov 15 and I can buy you lunch?
 If not, pick a time that day as I'm fairly open.

    Thanks for the information, John,
    I want to set up a meeting with you for mid-November to show you how we
    are
    representing market activity and talk to you about forward open
    interests.
 
    How does November 15 or so look for you?
 
    Cheryl
