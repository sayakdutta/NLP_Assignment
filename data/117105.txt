 The process for approving these involves sending the names to the General 
 Counsels of the various operating companies here in Houston.  Several of them 
 then send the lists to the senior business people in their organizations.  
 Unless there is a real urgency, I would suggest that we send the list all at 
 once instead of piecemeal.  What do you think?

 We are in the process of selecting a large number of reference credits to be 
 approved for display on the web site.  Our intention is to have 1000 names on 
 line by the end of the quarter.  We are internally scrubbing the lists now 
 and will forward them soon.  In the meantime, can we get approval to quote 
 the following on line:
 
 Transocean Sedco Forex Inc.
 KPN N.V.
 Deutsche Telekom
 Technost International
 Vivendi
 Ryder Systems
 Petrocanada
 
 thanks
