  Attached is the testimony on the revenue requirement for SCE owned
 generation and contracts (including QFs) that was filed yesterday in
 response to the ACR.  There was also an appendix B, which contains the
 advice letter filings referred to in the testimony.  These advice letters
 (1521-E, 1528-E-A, 1528-E-B and 1534-E-A) are available on the SCE website
 (www.sce.com), and then clicking on Regulatory Info Center.
