 
 I found it!  It was in a box in my garage.  Thanksgiving was just ok - have had better.  how was yours and what did you do this weekend?
 
  
     
 just wanted to remind you to start looking for your c-card now!  don't know if you want to scuba or not, but nice to 
 have options.
 
 Hope you had a nice thanksgiving - we need to go for drinks soon!
