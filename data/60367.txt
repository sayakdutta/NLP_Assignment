 Louise,
 
 Sorry to bother you with this request, but I'm not sure who else to ask:
 
 A number of people have expressed an interest in the details of the auction process and any insight it might provide as to what a final deal might look like.
 
 Are there publically available documents covering the auctions process and descriptions of compliant bids?
