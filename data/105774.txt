 We need to eliminate Appendix B altogether.  We have previously agreed to 
 eliminate substitution and FAS 125 does not require substitution.  I have 
 only one more issue to resolve. 
 
 Will you revise again?

 Attached are my comments to your initial draft of Appendix C to the Canadian 
 form of repo agreement.  Please note the following:
 
 (1)  You attached "Annex II" to the end of Appendix C.  That annex came from 
 the US repo with Merrill.  The information should actually be incorporated 
 into "Appendix A" of your repo agreement.
 
 (2)  I am waiting to hear internally regarding substitution and a default 
 issue.
 
 (3)  Please let me know if we have any issues on the Appendix C (and add a 
 reference to Appendix C at the end of your printed form).  
 
 We should be ready to execute shortly.
 
 Thanks.
