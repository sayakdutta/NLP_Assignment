 Dear Mike,
 
 Thank you for the introduction to David Tagliarino.
 We spoke at length yesterday, and he seems like a very
 good guy.  He also seemed very receptive to the
 possibility of us working together, and I am hoping to
 schedule a meeting with him in the near future.  In
 the meantime, I sent him some information on our
 company, and the players we represent.  I am confident
 that we can be of help to you, and obviously, we would
 appreciate the opportunity to do so.
 
 I know that you have been very successful at Enron,
 and I am happy for you.  I am sure things will only
 get better.
 
 If I am fortunate enough to schedule a meeting with
 David, I would love to stop by your office and say
 hello.  I will keep you posted.  In the meantime, I
 wish you and your family a happy holiday season, and
 again, I appreciate your help.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 David N. Winkle
