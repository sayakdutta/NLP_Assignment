 
 I thought about giving you a personal Happy Birthday wake up call this 
 morning when I got up, but I thought after the night before you probably 
 needed all the sleep you could get.  So see here I was being nice...there's 
 just no pleasing some people.  
 
 I got home about 10 last night which I was pretty excited about.  But no 
 sooner did I get comfortable as I got a call from Rock.  AAAAAAHHHHHHHH.  
 Sorry that just slipped out.  I'll have to vent later.
 
 I'll give you a birthday call later.

 Don't you think that you are going to get away with just leaving a message.  
 I am waiting for a more personal Happy Birthday call. 
 
 Thanks anyways. 
 
 What time did you get out of here yesterday?
