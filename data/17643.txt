 Tom:  Apologies.  I'm wrapped up, but will try to come up with more.  Three 
 things that come to mind:
 
 1. Seems important that any price cap include a hard sunset date.
 2. Direct Access for all customers in California should be a concession.
 3. Dramatic commitment from California to substantially upgrade the in-state 
 gas transportation network (fyi: it may  be in worse shape than the electric 
 tx network--can build more plants, but if one can't get the gas to them.....)
 
 Best,
 Jeff
