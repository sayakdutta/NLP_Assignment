 You really don't want me doing your laundry - just ask my husband how many 
 pair of pink underwear he has as a result of my laundry ability!

 Cindy, Tim, Marly, Pam, and Neil -- 
 
 I will make my house available for you do do the first week of laundry this 
 weekend.  How about 6:30 am on Saturday?  After that, you can schedule it at 
 your convenience for the rest of the 4 weeks.  
 
 I am prepared for you ; I bought Tide, Downey, and Bounce, as well as spray 
 starch for all the ironing that needs to be done -- don't worry, I only have 
 5-6 full-sized tablecloths and about 15 of Trey's shirts to be ironed.  That 
 shouldn't take too long.
 
 See you then. 
 
 Michelle

 Gerry, Michelle and I rather enjoyed our discussion at lunch time. It was 
 highly productive and I would like to thank those who took the time out of 
 their very busy schedules to attend.
 
 In no small way related to the high calibre of the people at the meeting and 
 the skills of the facilitation, we accomplished a great deal. For ease of 
 reference and to make sure you each are clearly on you action before our next 
 meeting, here is a summary:
 
 General Minutes
 The group voted David, Michele and Gerry as the most intelligent and 
 attractive members of the HR community
 Gerry had the most interesting strory about disciplining people who are 
 always late for meetings by having their houses visited by a radical 
 Californian based sect who do the reverse of an exorcism.
 The average IQ of those present was measured as over 200 (thanks to Michelle).
 Gerry won the tic tack tow tournament 
 I won the biggest feet competition
 
 Follow up action points
 It was agreed that Tim, Cindy, Marla, Neil and Pam would do the laundry for 
 Michelle for the next 4 weeks.
 It was agreed that Tim, Cindy, Marla, Neil and Pam would clean David and 
 Gerry's houses every Tuseday and Thursday for the next month (Gerry is 
 concerned about his antique china and has requested that Neil doesn't visit 
 his home).
 All the wrongs of the world are to be solved and the necessary actions 
 implemented by Tim, Cindy, Marla, Neil and Pam by next Monday at 5pm central 
 time (including third world debt and world hunger).
 
 Thanks
 
 David
