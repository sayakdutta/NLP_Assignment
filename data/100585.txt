 
 Chad, attached is the draft of the Measurement and Control Facilities 
 Operating Agreement for Calpine's review.  As we discussed, because the 
 exhibits are still being finalized, I have not included them in this draft.  
 If you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to contact me.
 
 Thank you.
