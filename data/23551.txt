 Dear Nancy:
 Among others, Rebecca McDonald, Jim Derrik, Jim Hughes and Jeff Sommers
 were appointed to be members of Elektro's Board of Directors.
 They will be formally elected as such during a Shareholders' Meeting that
 will take place this Monday, 30th  of April at 10:00 AM and in order to
 vote the slate with the new members I need their full names, nationality,
 profession, if they are married or not, their commercial address and, since
 they do not live in Brazil, their Passport numbers.
 Could you provide this information to me if possible today.
 Should you have any doubt, please call me.(55 19 3726 15446)
 Thank you so very much
 Vasco
