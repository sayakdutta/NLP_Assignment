 Just a note to say I hope that you and the other good people I have met over the past couple of years are able to overcome the difficulties you are currently facing at Enron.  As you know we are continuing to market our GPCM Natural Gas Market Forecasting System to the industry and have done pretty well in that effort.  In fact, we are doing well enough that our users are in need of good analysts who could quickly learn our system and operate it for their companies.  There are three or four openings in Houstonand several others in other cities in the U.S.  If you can think of anyone who has worked for you who would be both capable and interested in this kind of application, I would be happy to forward their names and information to the people who are looking.
 Again, good luck in whatever you choose to do, please stay in touch, and thanks for your help.
