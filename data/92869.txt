 
 Hey,
 
 I checked out the Houston Chronicle website and there were two Preludes that 
 would be comparable to mine.  One was advertised for $21,995(which is the 
 blue book) and the other was advertised for $18,900ish.  Of course both were 
 being sold by dealers, so I probably couldn't get quite that much.  But I can 
 probably get enough to make it worthwhile to go ahead and sell my car.  I 
 just wonder how long it would take before it actually sold.  
 
 That's what I've accomplished since lunch.  Talk to ya later,
 Robin
