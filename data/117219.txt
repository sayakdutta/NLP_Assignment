 EnronOnline will assist users, upon request, in arranging for direct access 
 connection (such as a "T1" line or other means of direct access) to 
 EnronOnline, as an alternative to internet access.   Direct access 
 connections might enable users to access EnronOnline more quickly than is 
 currently possible through internet access.
