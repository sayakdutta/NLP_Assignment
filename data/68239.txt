Can you verify that it is her Aruba book that is causing all of the VaR.  She only has positions at about 5 locations and they should all be mapped to the same omicron curve and either NG or Chi. Gate.  I would think that there would not be that much difference between NG and Chi Gate.  Any assistance is greatly appreciated.  Thanks.

  Bharat ,
  I've done the mapping of omicron but you need to contact book administrators to do the sec-prim. mapping as I don't have permission to do that.
 
  Thanks.
