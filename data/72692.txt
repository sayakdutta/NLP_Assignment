 
 Me again.  I forgot to ask you to look at 4.7, 8.3 and article 6 of the LLC

 Attached please find revised copies of the LLC Agreement and Letter
 Agreement that are marked to show the changes that we have made to Paul
 Hasting's drafts of the same.  As I will be out of the office tomorrow,
 please let John know if you have any additional changes so that he may send
 the documents to Marguerite by mid-morning.  Thanks!
