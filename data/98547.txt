 Confidential and Privileged Attorney-Client Communication
 
 I attended a seminar this morning at which Joan Feldman of Computer Forensics 
 spoke.  I think it would be a good idea for us to have a conference call with 
 Joan to review our email storage policy.   If you agree, I will have my 
 assistant set one up.
