 As a condition to ENA entering into any new transactions with ConEd, Credit is requiring that ConEd execute the Amendment to Confirmation for Deal No. 514094.01 (to make sure both deals have identical credit).
 
 Should you enter into a transaction with ConEd, and they haven't signed the amendment to the existing transaction, the new transaction may have to be unwound.
 
 Please let us know if you have any questions.
 
 Thanks!
