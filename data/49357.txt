 
 Dale,
 
 Your memory did not fail you.
 We would like, however, to move the meeting to 2 p.m. Tuesday.
 
 I left you a voice message about it. Please call me s soon as 
 possible to confirm.

 Vince:
 
 I was writing to confirm the meeting you wanted to set up with me, yourself,
 and Mr. Goodpasture for next Tuesday.  I believe it was set for 300 pm this
 coming Tuesday at your offices.  (I seem to have misplaced where I wrote the
 specific time, so I wanted to be sure to reconfirm.)  Please confirm if you
 get a second so that I can finalize my travel schedule.  You can email or
 phone 650.218.3069. Thanks.  I look forward to meeting with you again and
 with Mr. Goodpasture.
 
 Dale Nesbitt
