 
 I have made the following adjustment to our EPMI sales to EES on 3/1 at SP-15.
 
 534313 - existing fixed price forward sale - volumes have been reduced by 18 
 mw per hour
 
 559314 - new index sale added and backdated (2/28)  to reflect 18 mw off peak 
 hours
 559316 - new index sale added and backdate (2/28) to reflect 18 mw on peak 
 hours
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions regarding this change. At the 
 end of last month Short Term California handed responsibility of Dow Jones 
 index sales over to the Short Term West Services desk; unfortunately the 
 exact date of change-over was miscommunicated, and the index sale was not 
 entered for 3/1. However, the total MWh of EPMI's sale to EES should not 
 change for 3/1. Also, you should see the new volumes reflected in the EES 
 daily volumes worksheet which I will send later this afternoon.
 
 Thanks for your patience,
 Kate Symes
