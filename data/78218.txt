 Here's the language they offered:
 
 M. Each of the Cities has obligated itself to be responsible for and to pay=
 =20
 to, or on behalf of, MDEA, if required, that proportion of the minimum=20
 monthly fee which that City=01,s hourly demand was coincident with Entergy=
 =01,s=20
 peak hour demand in the year 2000 bears to the sum of both Cities=01, hourl=
 y=20
 demand during such hour; provided however, that each City has further=20
 obligated itself to be responsible for and to pay that portion of EMPI=01,s=
 =20
 monthly fee which the economic benefit to that City from transactions bears=
 =20
 to the total economic benefit to both Cities from such transactions during=
 =20
 the month.
 
 
 It is a bit cumbersome, but I think I like it.  What do you think?
 
 I'll forward the entire doc soon.
