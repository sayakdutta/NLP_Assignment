 
 Let's begin rolling out the cash products at 7:15 am.  We should also get 
 back to the cash strategy of the desk each morning.  Let's start testing the 
 market, find the support and resistance each day.  It would be nice to have 
 EOL change the stack manager so that we can switch a product from manage 
 market depth to last trade is mid with the click of a button, and not go 
 through the product properties.  I'll call them tomorrow.
 
 Let's also decide on a time to close the products each morning.  We want to 
 send the message of reliability, but also allow our Ops group to balance and 
 nom.  I want to begin trading the next day cash by 11:01 am every day.  This 
 would stay active until 4:00.
 
 The push is for PHYSICAL.  Our edge over the market will be phys.  From risk 
 to the ability to nominate and invoice, the other platforms will never see it 
 coming. What are the chances that ICE and espeed will deal with el paso 
 flows?  If information is the reason for EOL, then this will provide it.  It 
 all seems so simple - Fixed priced physical, just when you thought it was old 
 economy.  The reliable indices to big position trading to EOL market share, 
 all benefit under the new mantra.
