 
 Ron, 
 
 Your e-mail was such a pleasant surprise!  Thanks so much for the kind words.
 
 I would love to get together for lunch in the near future, though January is 
 typically a tough month for me.  I'll have my assistant, Sherri Sera, call 
 your office to see what we can arrange.
 
 Thanks again for the note.  I look forward to seeing you soon.
 
 Jeff
