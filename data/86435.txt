 The dreaded time has come. Rent goes up and it is a month earlier.
 The initial $8,000 payment is due to Mertz on March 1, 2002.
 
 In addition, I paid Mertz $500 for the protien that he fed during the last 
 hunting season.
 
 I need each of you to forward me a check for $1,071.42. Send to 815 walker, 
 suite 1447, H/T 77002. Thank you.
 
 Erik.
