 What happens to those people that are currently on Ecogas cobra when Ecogas
 is no longer in existence? They have not utilized the 18 months that they
 would be entitled to receive those benefits. Is Enron going to pick them up
 like they did for the 10/13/00 layoff? Do we need to direct this question to
 someone at Enron?
