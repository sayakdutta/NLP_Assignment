 Gagliardi here in Houston has asked so he can give the name to his 
 counterpart in the US.

 mark - still waiting i'm afraid...but am chasing again.  we certainly do not 
 want to re-open matters with BP in the US....we spent a good 2/3 months with 
 BP London negotiating the EOL side letter

 The commercial guys have asked me for an update on where we stand with BP.  
 Any news?
