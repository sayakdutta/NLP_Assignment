 
 AND ALL THAT GREEN SHIT THAT WAS GROWING WILL DIE, AS WILL SOME DEER COME THE WEEKENED OF THE 15TH
 
 

  
 
 Band of snow about to cross the lease...forecast for tomorrow is for
 snow accumulations of an inch. Currently 36 dg. w/ n-ne winds at 26,
 gusting to 30 w/ flurries on the way. Think the deer are active? I'm
 pissed!!!
 
 

  
 
 Deer All:
 
 Keith, great looking buck! Chris, I can't believe you passed that deer
 up. 
 Very generous.
 
 Chad shot a nice 10 point. Very impressive hunt. He hunted boneyard in
 the 
 morning, then hopped the fence into the robertson pasture and rattled
 the 
 deer withing 10 yards or so and managed to connect on a running shot as
 the 
 deer bolted away.
 
 I fed my Python a gobbler at LoneStar. Then shot a solid schlocho at the
 
 Hole sunday morning.
 
 Pictures forthcoming.
 
 Joe's beginner's honeymoon has come to an end. He saw nothing decent 
 everywhere he went.
 
 Brian saw an impressive young 9 pt at booger. Jim videotaped it the next
 
 morning. 21" wide or so, short tines. Very tempting deer, but all agreed
 
 that it was 4.5 and should go another year.
 
 Dogs could not find Jim's deer. Dogs headed from last blood due south to
 
 fence at highway.
 
 Feeders are all in good shape, except Boneyard. It is running at 7 and
 4:30. 
 But weak. Chris indicated it needed a bigger battery. We considered
 putting 
 a magnum on it, but if all it needs is a new battery, we'll leave it to
 you. 
 We should get it running well, lots of deer in that area. One good
 schlocho 
 and a bladed spike that needs to be shot. I put a new battery in
 Lonestar 
 and we filled it up. Booger topped off with motor run time increased.
 30-30 
 was empty. We filled it up. Pig filled up an run time increased. We have
 
 lots of corn, so if a feeder is not dropping lots of corn, turn up the
 spin 
 time and keep em full. Dropping extra corn also worked well at mesquite
 and 
 showtime..
 Mertz will feed protien next week. I consulted with Chris and houston
 boys 
 openning weekend regarding mertz offer to let us buy extra protien this 
 fall, since he had met the quota. We agreed to see what he would feed
 but 
 cap it at $500, spread across the board.
 
 Looks like Houston boys will be retruning December 15th weekend and
 closing 
 weekend. I'll be bringing Henry on next trip and think it would be great
 if 
 Keitha nd boys would be there too.
 
 Hope Keith and Jim can make it back as soon as possible. We winterized 
 trailer on way out. Keg almost empty.
