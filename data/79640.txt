 Mike,
 
 We met back in the early summer and made a presentation to you, Steve Horn,
 and Allan Sommer regarding SeaLogistics.  Since that time, we have completed
 a merger with one of our primary competitors, launched our bulk
 shipping/e-chartering exchange and now have begun trading on the site.  We
 currently have support from charterers representing approximately 10% of the
 global petroleum shipping spot market volume and from ship owners
 representing approximately 15% of the large tanker fleet.
 
 I saw that Enron announced last month its entry into the freight futures
 market for bulk petroleum shipping.  Given this event and our marketplace
 momentum, I thought it may make sense to have a more strategic discussion
 around possible opportunities between Enron and SeaLogistics.
 
 Please let me know your interest in discussing further a potential joint
 opportunity.
 
 Best regards,
 
 Brad
