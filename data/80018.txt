 El Paso Energy is acquiring Coastal Corporation, where I am currently
 employed.  El Paso will probably retain my employment in my current role as
 Project Leader of Corporate/Refining & Marketing Systems Support, but I
 would prefer working for Enron.  The proposed acquisition of Coastal by El
 Paso will not be effective until October.
 
 I just talked to Steve Schneider at Enron, and he highly recommended that I
 forward my resume to you with a copy to Mike McConnell.  Steve also said
 that he would be available to provide a personal reference on my behalf.
 
 Attached you will find my current resume.  I would prefer opportunities in
 the following areas (in this order if possible): project management,
 database development, and mainframe system support.  My ideal job
 assignments would include all three, but I am open to whatever might be
 available.  Opportunities to learn new technology would be great!
 
 Please do not hesitate in contacting me at my business telephone number
 (713-877-3081).
 
 Thank you for your time and consideration!
