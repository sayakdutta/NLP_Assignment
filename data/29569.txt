 Lisa,
 
 Mark is the one that is taking care of that CP and he is not in today.Sabrina Minnis is original coordinator and I asked if she had copies of the information for Hafslund and she replied that she gave it information to Mark Confer.  I'll leave him a note letting him know what you need. The Hafslund issue that I was working with is dealing with the month of Jan 2001. Let me know if I could be of any more assistance to you.

 Lisa,
 
 	DO you need the detail the Enron has for Hafslund or the detail from Hasfslund or Dec 01?
