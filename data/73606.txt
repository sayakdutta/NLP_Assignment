 nothing at school.  She has no independent information on the rest and 
 shouldn't worry about providing that info to them.
 
 
 
 


   
  
 I was out of the office yesterday and apologize for the delay in responding.
 I'm not sure about class/type. Michael does see Sharon Seals and Associates
 Speech-Language Pathologists once a week for 1 hour. The only testing has
 been from Danny Williamson, Developmental Pediatrician who is an associate
 of Nancy LaFever. This was an eval for ADHD. He was also tested by SBISD for
 the same issue. Williamson and LaFever have all this information in his
 file.
 Thanks for you help with this. Neil
 
 
     
 
 Hi Neil!  Michael looked so happy to see you for chapel today.  Thanks for
 being there.
 
 I have a few questions in order to complete this form.  It asks a couple of
 questions about the help he is receiving outside of school.  If you could
 answer them for me, I can have this turned in tomorrow.
 
 Classification?
 Type?
 Hours per Week?
 Has Michael received any testing from the outside help (speech/language
 specialist)?
 
 Today Michael told me that I would "have to come over soon, because (he)
 would be going far away from St. Francis for summer camp".  If he is adamant
 about us getting together outside of school, I would be happy to meet you
 and Michael or Michael and Kay (or his sister) for a lunch date
 somewhere/sometime this summer.  Let me know.
 
 Once again, I have really enjoyed getting to know your family.  See you at
 the party Wednesday at 2:15.
 Kara
