 
 Kay,  Could you send me a copy of the draft of the HNG Agreement.  Thanks
 
 
 
    
 Gerald:  I don't find any executer agreements with or pertaining to either 
 entity.  We have a draft agreement with HNG Storage about our possible 
 financing of their purchase of Energy South, but I don't have an executed 
 agreement - that was in September.

 Kay, Could you pull and send me copies of any Confidentiality Agreements any 
 Enron entities have with the following companies:
 
 Bay Gas Storage
 Energy South
 
 Not sure what type of entities they are.  Let me know if you need any further 
 information.  Thanks for your help.
