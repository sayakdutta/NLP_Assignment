 Rob,
 
 I will start preparing the models and working with Tracee to make sure we 
 have everything up to date for the lenders.
 
 Thanks.

 I spoke with Mary Mervene this morning and the llenders declined to convene 
 this week although we will arrange an ECA call for Thursday or Friday.  Mary 
 has requested that we do the following:
 
 1) Send the Lenders and S&W the new budget info and the revised change order 
 summary.
 
 2) Revise the model to reflect the new costs and the new timeline.
 
 3) S&W will review the model and then we will repeat the exercise of 
 calculating fuel oil and Furnas penalty exposures.
 
 4) Finalize sponsor support elements.
 
 This can all occur fairly quickly except I am concerned because we have not 
 resolved the budget with Shell,  and theoretically the lenders can take 30 
 days to review the model and budget when submitted.
 
 We also need to discuss strategy because we may want to delete the 
 contingency from the budget since the lenders are going to want the sponsors 
 to commit to some general contingency supporty anyway.
