 What? Is receiving an email at 1:30 too late? Just because everything is done by 10...At least NW is on the right side of the market...oh wait...their not...doh! And looks like today was a bad day to go short...but who's counting? 
 
  
     
 How nice of her to give us such advanced notice......
 
  
     
 We are long at MIDC for Tuesday, 10/02/01.  HE 7-22 at 25mw, #797763.1.  This is due to parking by the NW Cash desk.
 
 Thanks
