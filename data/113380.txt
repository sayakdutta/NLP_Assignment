 Please send the invoice to my assistant - Linda Noske - to have her take it through the system.  Her phone number is 713-853-6082.
 
 Thanks,

 Jim,
 
 In trying to clear up some of our outstanding invoices, I contacted the
 Enron Accounts Payable Department and they have no record of our May invoice
 for $12,500.
 
 They told me to go ahead and send a copy of the invoice directly to them,
 but it will expedite things if I include on the invoice your Enron company
 name and number and your external identification number. If you could reply
 to this message with that info, I'd appreciate it.
 
 If I can answer any questions regarding the invoice, or anything else for
 that matter, please don't hesitate to contact me. Thanks.
 
 Regards,
 Jeff
