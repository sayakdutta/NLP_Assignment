 A fire fighter is working on the engine outside the
 station when he notices a little girl next door in a
 little red
 wagon with little ladders hung off of the side and a
 garden hose
 tightly coiled in the middle.
 
 The girl is wearing a fire-fighter's helmet and has
 the wagon tied to a dog and a cat.
 
 The fire fighter walks over to take a closer look.
 "That sure is a nice fire truck," the fire fighter
 says, with
 admiration.
 
 "Thanks," the little girl says.
 
 The fire fighter looks a little closer and notices
 the girl has tied the wagon to the dog's collar and
 to the cat's
 testicles.
 
 "Little partner" the fire fighter says, "I don't
 want to tell you how to run your fire truck, but if
 you were to tie
 that
 rope around the cat's collar, I think you could go
 faster."
 
 The little girl says, "You're probably right, but
 then I wouldn't
 have a siren.
