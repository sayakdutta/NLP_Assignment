 Interest revised to delete the sentence with respect to obtaining certain 
 agreements with respect to Broker's customers.  If the enclosed meets with 
 your approval, please sign the attached and return it to me via fax no. (713) 
 853-3399 and I will have it executed by Enron.  If you have any comments or 
 questions, please do not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3399.
