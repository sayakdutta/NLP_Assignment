 
 Hey,
 
 Tell your mom I'll call her this weekend.  I plan on being at your mom's house the whole day (I don't want to impose..but I'm sure she won't mind)  I don't have to go to the dentist on Friday so I'm free the whole day lets do something.  I'll call you on sat.  
 
 go noles,

 Any more news on next week? Are you still flying in at 10:00 pm. I want to let mom know a little in advance if you want to go to Vero.  I cannot believe Larry Dierker resigned, although he probably would have been fired anyway.  This Saturday is full of great games and of couse I have to work until 2:00, ridiculous.  Later
    
  
     What's up? 
 I will be coming in town the weekend of Nov 1st - Nov 4th.  I hope you 
 don't have plans for that Saturday.  I'll find out today if I can get him 
 for the whole day (12:00 to 7:00) If things workout I would like to take 
 him to Vero for the day.  So I was thinking you could go with me to pick 
 him up and we could spend the day and night in Vero?  Let me know what you 
 think?  My sister will probably also come (just for the day).  As soon as I 
 find out I'll let you know. 
 Anyway,  how are things down there?  Last weekend I went to Austin for the 
 UT and Colorado game (Austin is an awesome place!!!)

                Bird, where you in town this weekend? I talked to your sister for a 
    little while and she said you might be coming into town. 
    The Astros are good.  What's going on with Peyton? I am sure Tonya is 
    being reasonable again.
