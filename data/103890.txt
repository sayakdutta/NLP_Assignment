 
 All:  I spoke with Bill Bradford to get the global credit perspective, and, 
 he is entirely neutral.  However, he agreed that it made sense for Enron 
 Corp. to transact on its own stock.  
 
 I am prepared to draft new ISDA Master Agreements with our remaining 
 potential targets in the name of "Enron Corp." without Credit Support 
 Annexes.  Upon execution, the parties generally exchange evidence of 
 authority (i.e., resolution or excerpt thereof).  
 
 The outstanding confirms are in the name of Enron Corp.  These are "Deemed 
 ISDA's" and no party has asked for evidence of authority (although the 
 parties do represent that they have such authority).
 
 Please let me hear from you if someone objects to the use of Enron Corp.   
 Thanks.  Sara
