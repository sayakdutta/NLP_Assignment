 Thanks for the message.  I appreciate you covering these meetings.  While I 
 know you are looking at your return with mixed feelings, I am really looking 
 forward to having you back here.  As an aside, I did get a raise approved for 
 you.  It is 5%, but I am still waiting final verification from Human 
 Resources.

 The GISB working session was as exciting as you would expect it to be.  Most 
 of the early termination and alternative damages provision concepts were 
 hammered out.  A law firm (Shook & Shook) volunteered to draft language for 
 the concepts agreed to in time for next Friday's committee meeting.  There 
 was lot of discussion of what is going on in California and how the early 
 termination process should work.  Enron should be fine with all of the 
 concepts except the law firm was pushing an extremely broad set off right.  I 
 don't think that is will go cross affiliates but it will go across 
 contracts.  We will have to see the actual words.  I will attend the next 
 meeting most likely by phone.  Hope things are going well.  See you in 13 
 days.
