 
 Steve,
 
 Thanks. I printed the fundamental info
 last night and will wait for the open.
 
 I negotiated a few contracts for  Enron's contribution to a book
 (Enron was a sponsor).  It's not the same as negotiating as an author.
 
 You can call a friend of mine, John Martin, and he will be able to help you.

 Good morning,
 
 First, a reminder that you want to see follow through strength on the picks 
 before going into them Secondly do you know anybody that has published a 
 book? I need some help in how to negotiate points in the contract.
 
 Thanks,   Steve
