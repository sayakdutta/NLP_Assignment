 
 What's up rude-dog.  Haven't heard any new recruiting news.  I think it is 
 going to be quiet on that front until later in the football season.  
 
 I was up in Denver this past week and talked to Jessica Wentworth.  She said 
 you have been exploring the Australian countryside.  Bet there is some 
 amazing stuff down under.  Anyway, drop me a note and let me know how its 
 going.
 
 I know I have asked this before, but when are you getting into town?  We need 
 to have some repatriation beers upon your arrival.
