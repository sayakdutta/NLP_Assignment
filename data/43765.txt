 Sure.  Probably the best method is for us to overnight them to you -- we can email filings made at the Commission if you can use an Image reading program -- I'll work with my assistant on it and may do a test with you.
 
 Will let you know.
 
  
     
 Hi Nancy--
 	yesterday the Full Requirements shipper responses were due at FERC.  If it's not too voluminous, can I get a copy emailed or faxed?
 
 I'm travelling till Monday but if you need to talk, page me at 888-582-7421.
 
 thx
