 Next week is professional administrative assistants week.  If you are in 
 agreement, I will order your assistant a beautiful bouquet to be delivered on 
 Monday for her to enjoy all week.  The floral companies are already receiving 
 orders and I want to order the flowers by Friday. 
 
 If there is anything else that you want done, please let me know and I will 
 be happy to help you out since your schedules are so busy.
