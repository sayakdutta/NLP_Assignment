   Question 9 - Can the Master User give others Master User privileges or can

 EnronOnline system (if it is within the range you specify)"

 trader user ID's & passwords?
 
 Legal   Question 3 - Password Application,not Agreement;  "framework for 
 transactions carried out"
 
 Earnings Related Questions - Will these be posted for all to see?  If so, we
