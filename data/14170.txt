 
 Jim,
 
 I found a consultant who does extensive studies on world tissue. PLease read below. Just wanted to know if you knew the guy. His name is Esko Uutella and he is located in Germany.
 
 
     
 
 Hi Ms. Causholli,
 
 I have made recently a major multiclient study "Outlook for World Tissue 
 Business" which includes all tissue mills with capacities worldwide plus 
 capacity profiles by the largest producers worldwide and by region. I attach the 
 study proposal with this e-mail. The report costs US$ 3,500 (300 pages with 
 detailed Annexes).
 
 If you would like to have only capacity data for the regions you mentioned plus 
 the top 10-12 global producers, I could sell this part of information at US$ 
 600. You should specify the form in which I should present it so that I 
 could easier fulfil your data needs.
 
 
 Best regards
 
 Esko Uutela
