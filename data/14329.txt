 Hi Ami,
  
 Sorry for not getting to you earlier. I am at home today. I don't think I have the MTH prices. I have requested those from RISI today so hopefully they will send them to me fast. The other prices are in the folder o:/Industrial Markets/Fundamentals/Paper/Pulp/RISI PRICES
  
 Thanks,
 Monika
