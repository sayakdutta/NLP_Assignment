 Kay:
 
 He was in meetings all afternoon and hasn't had a chance to review the 
 changes.  He will try to get you and Dave connected on Monday to discuss the 
 assignment issue.  I think that is the only outstanding item.
 
  I sent a copy to Old Eagle Eyes Dieball for his final review and approval.  
 I'll have you sign off on Monday (I hope!)
 
 Enjoy an Enron-free weekend.
 Kathy
