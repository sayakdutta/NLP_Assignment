 Good morning Denise:
 
 After discussing this situation with Mike Roberts, Vice President in charge
 of the Weather Group, neither he nor I were aware of the existing contract,
 As was mentioned in our conversation, I thought I had cancelled this back 
 in November when Jim Gooding left the company.
 
 However, since there are just two payments owed (March and April 2000),
 we will pay this amount and ask that the contract be cancelled.  As you
 are aware, this service has not been used since last  November and Mike
 says that he knows of no one it can be transferred to.
 
 Please send us a final bill in the amount of $980.00 (2 months) and cancel
 the contract.
 
 If you need this cancellation request in "formal Letter" format, please let 
 me know.
 
 Thanks for your help.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Shirley Crenshaw
 Administrative Coordinator
 Research Group
