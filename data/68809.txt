 
 Attached are the spreadsheets you requested.  The first tab - 100 is the same 
 sheet as the one we discussed earlier.  The second tab 60.40 is the sheet 
 that assumes Tom only gets 40% and Sharpe gets the asset deals.  The third 
 tab is the revised summary sheet for all months if the 60.40 split is the 
 route we choose to go.  Please feel free to give me a call with any 
 questions.  Thanks.
