 Sara: The only list that we have that is permanent is the Origination list. 
 You would receive e-mails about all the deals and prospective deals 
 originated by the group, including trading. Would you like to be added to 
 this one? The other option would be adding you to specific trading deal lists 
 that usually include only those directly involved with that specific deal 
 (and is never very consistent. To be quite honest, not all the Origination 
 deals are circulated through the Origination list). As far as I know, other 
 than Moema - the 10-year PPA, there's nothing going on at the moment. No Term 
 Sheets signed or anything. I spoke to Brent today about the Moema deal. There 
 are some issues that I still have to clarify with the business people such as 
 to who we are going to sell the power, contingencies, etc. I could not get a 
 hold of Remi, who is coordinating the deal. As soon as I talk to him I'll 
 send you guys an update.

 Andrea:  Would you please see that I am added to circulation of  the deal 
 transaction list (containing trading deals)?  Thanks.  Sara
