 much more personal impact than "Most Favored Nation" status.  I would 
 certainly want to stay on Marie good side.  Though I know it is tough to 
 compete with sweet Russell...

 Is that like "Most Favored Nation" status?  If so, don't I already have that?
 
 
     
 I'm glad to hear that someone from Credit it showing up!  I heard we weren't 
 going to have a good turnout from you guys, so I expect those that do attend 
 will achieve "favored Credit person" status.

 I was saving my energy for Marie's party tonight.   You know how ice cream 
 takes it out of you.
 
 
     
 Always my pleasure. ...I don't want to risk having you unhappy two days in a 
 row...by the way, where we you for the ice cream social?!
