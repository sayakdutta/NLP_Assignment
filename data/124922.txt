 Baruuuh?
 
  
     
 We have entered into another lending agreement with El Paso for Tuesday, 7/24. I've entered deals to show this in our system as a purchase from El Paso at $4 (fee for lending - to be changed if we end up actually purchasing from El Paso) and a sale to STSW. This is a 25 mw on peak schedule (tag entered by Lisa Gang) to be delivered at Palo Verde. We need to send 25 mws (zero price) to EPE real-time at PV to fulfil our part of the agreement. Following are the terms of these deals:
 
 697528 - STWBOM buys EPE


 	 (This price represents El Paso's fee for lending)
 
 697536 - STWBOM sells STSW


 
 Let me know if you have any questions.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate
