Starbucks has always charged a premium price for a "premium product".  Recently, the quality of the coffee served downstairs has been miserable.  Very often the coffee that they serve is burnt and you can tell just by smelling it.  It tastes horrible and I know it isn't just me because about 5 or 6 people who sit next to me have all had the same conversation about how the coffee is always burnt.  Today, I bought a large coffee and by the time I returned to my desk took the first sip and it was horrible.  I went back to the lobby and told the girl it was burnt and she smelled it and agreed.  Then she gave me a new cup that was supposed to be fresh brewed.  It was just as bad.  It tastes and smells horrible!  Something has to be changed because the quality of the coffee doesn't deserve a price of a $.25 much less over $1.00
