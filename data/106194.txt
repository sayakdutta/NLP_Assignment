 
 Did you speak with your ECTRIC credit counterpart?  Who is it?  Did he make 
 this inquiry already?  One of you needs to speak wtih Total.  The "due 
 diligence" issue is a credit responsibility.  Please let us know how we can 
 help.

 Did we ever get any further on ECP issues related to ENA subs, i.e. ECTRIC 
 business with Total International Ltd, an unsupported subsidiary of TotalFina.
 
 I have left two emails with my contact regarding ECP issues, with no reply.  
 What are our choices to do with trade v34062, a trade not yet confirmed with 
 this customer.  I don't see this as a credit issue, but more of a legal 
 issue.  From a credit standpoint, I am ok with the trade.
 
 Adam - consider these guys on the No Trade list until we can finalize 
 handling status.
