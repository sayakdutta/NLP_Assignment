 
 Ed,
 
 I am sure I shall screw up sooner or later (given my aging brain and
 amount of work). This  guy will have to change his name
 to Ed Krapels to stay employed.

 Vince,
 
 I think this other guy used to be named John Smith but changed his name to
 Vince Kaminski to get a job in the power sector!
 
 Ed
 
 

  
 
 Ed,
 
 I am still here.
 Kaminski is a very popular Polish name.
 
 My next stage in life, when it happens , is a small cottage
 close to a beach, not another corporate job.
