 
 Taffy, I just spoke to Marie and she needs a set.  Also, take Susan Flynn and 
 Jason Peters off your distribution.

 Good morning.
 
 Following-up yesterday's discussion regarding the ISDA Notebooks, I am 
 preparing to have extra sets of the ISDA Notebooks printed.  Please advise 
 how many sets you need, if any.
