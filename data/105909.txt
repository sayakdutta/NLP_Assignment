 Per my voice mail of date, please feel free to contact me aboutthe 2/1/01 gas 
 floor.  As I mentioned in my voice mail, the ISDA Commodity Derivatives 
 Definitions provide for the Floating Amount language for caps and floors (see 
 Section 6.2).  "Exercise" language is not necessary as this is addressed in 
 the referenced definitions.
