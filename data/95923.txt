 Mike Small is definitely a better tennis player than WSPP facilitator.  
 Coaching seems to be his real passion.
 
 I'm sorry I  can't play Saturday am - it is Sam's 3rd birthday and we are 
 scrambling to find a birthday concept.
 
 On a better note, I can play all this week. Any day, any time works for me - 
 let me know when you can.
 
 Talk to you soon.
