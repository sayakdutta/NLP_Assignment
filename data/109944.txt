 just not want to do business with Enron too badly!  I wouldn't waste a whole 
 lot of time on this.  Happy Easter...SRS

 I have been in contact with this guy.  He didn't have time to speak on first 
 contact, so we set up a time to talk on Monday, and he did not call and was 
 unavailable when I rang him.  Looking forward to his return call...

 Jay, Jeff received a call yesterday from a 2nd year HBS student and 
 co-founder of a B2B commerce company - Franz Edward Alphonse - who wanted to 
 speak to Jeff (for the ever-popular "5 minutes") about his company.  Jeff has 
 asked that you follow up with this gentleman.  His phone number is 
 617.493.5597.
 
 (Karen, I'm copying you in the event you have any information on Mr. Alphonse 
 - i.e., did he interview w/Enron and if so, how did he do).
 
 Thanks, Jay.  Please send Jeff a note with any update once you have spoken to 
 Franz.

 PS - I'm back from Italy and ready to have that drink whenever it works for 
 you and Greg.  I understand he's out for a few weeks now while he moves his 
 family to Houston...
