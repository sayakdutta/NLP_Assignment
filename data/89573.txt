 The executive committee met at the Lantern last night and it is confirmed that Ski Trip 2002 will take place January 30th - February 3rd at Lake Tahoe.  Venue will once again be Harrahs Reno due to the close proximity of the fine area amenities.  Uncle Johnny will be unable to make it due to having dinner guests in from Barrington.  However, the committee did approve of opening up the roster to additional participants.  Call me for details.
