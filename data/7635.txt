 
 Lunch probably won't work in that time frame.  I will be out on vacation on 
 Monday.  Tuesday's lunch is a standing Risk Forum Meeting and Wednesday I 
 will be out of the office during the lunch hour for a school function for one 
 of my daughters.  I will check with Ted Murphy on the Tuesday Risk Forum 
 meeting, as occassionally the meeting is cancelled.  I will get back in touch 
 if the Tuesday lunch does open up.  Would Amita like to meet at another time 
 during those days?  There is a possibility that I could do an early dinner on 
 Tuesday evening.  How does that work with Amita's schedule?  --Sally

 Hi Sally
 
 Amita from PCG - London will be visiting your offices next Monday - Wednesday 
 and would like to meet with you for lunch.  Do you have any available time in 
 these three days?
 
 Many thanks,
