 The menu is as follows:

 Appetizer                          Mocambo Shrimp
 Salad                                Smoked Trout on Baby Spring Greens with
 fresh                                                             lemon
 vinegarette
 Sorbet                                Mango
 Entree                                Filet Mignon (will be cooked medium

 otherwise advised)
                                             Duchess Potatoes
                                             Honey-Glazed Carrots

 This is what I wrote down when you and I discussed the menu.   We will put a
 candle on your father's dessert and I will play "Happy Birthday" while the
 family sings.
 
 We are looking forward to having you back again.  If there are any changes,
 let me know.
