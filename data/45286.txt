 my original approval for this counterparty to approve them to enter into 
 newsprint swaps and options only.  At this time our list does not reflect the 
 individual products you are trading.  I understand from Mark Taylor that he 
 spoke to Jeff Harbert last night about amending your excel spreadsheet to add 
 the individual pulp and paper financial products, since restrictions such as 
 this one will occur from time to time.

 Attached is the referenced list.  The Bakersfield California is approved to 
 only do newsprint commodity swaps and options.  Therefore, I have turned them 
 down to trade the current products we have available online.  As our product 
 base expands, we can send them through again as an amended counterparty if we 
 offer newprint commodity swaps and options online.
