 
 I talked to Diana Scholtes last night about this deal, and she looked at it 
 this afternoon. She says the deal is definitely not entered correctly, but 
 because it was done for the days when we got hit with transmission cuts, she 
 wants to look into it a little further before she changes or kills it. She 
 said she'd reconcile it tomorrow, and we'll let you know what we've done then.
 
 Thanks for your patience,
 Kate

 Hello, I think that deal # 476147 might should have been entered as a buy 
 resale instead of as transmission.  There are not any other transmission 
 deals in the system with this counterparty.  If you would not mind looking 
 into this and letting me know I would appreciate it.
 
 Thanks!
