 
 Is Ian a lawyer, paralegal or Credit person?  Also, Mark mentioned the London 
 Legal has been restructured somehow, and he asked me to ask you if could you 
 fax us an org chart that shows the structure...?
 
 I hear you got a fancy new car!

 Great idea - here's our latest ISDA schedule (note the changes to law, 
 process agent, notices, tax reps, etc)
 
 If you work with Ian, that would be grand

 Conditions Precedent and the Eligible Swap Participant  Changes after the
