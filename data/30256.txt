 
 Can we discuss?  Wha about next the first of next week?
 
  
     
 The project can not be justified, if you have the capital cost of the pigging facilities.  On a stand alone basis without the pigging facilities we can justify the project.

 Have you had a chance to run this?  If not, when do you think you will?
 
 Thanks
 
  
     
 Tracy,
 
 Have you made any progress on the economic analysis?
 
 Thanks,

 10,000 MMBTU/D of incremental capacity from LaPlata to Gallup.
 
 This is the working assumption from our initial conference call.  Like the +/- 30% cost figures below, it may vary with further evaluation, but I suggest it be used for this initial analysis.
 
 Thanks,

 How much additional capacity/volumes will I get?

 Tracy,
 
 Below are the rough cost estimates to apply drag reducing agent to the LaPlata to Bloomfield line.
 
 	Facility modifications			$1,665,000
 
 	Cleaning & application			   $165,000
 
 	Re-application every 6 months		   $165,000
 
 
 The facility modifications include a launcher at LaPlata, receiver at Bloomfield and a filter separator at the El Paso Blanco delivery.  The cleaning & application and re-applications costs include cleaning pig runs with methanol and surfactant as well costs for the actual DRA application.
 
 For analyzing sensitivities, all costs are +/- 30%.  The re-application time period is also uncertain.  You may want to look at the economics of re-apply as often as every three months and as infrequently as every 12 months.
 
 Please let me know of anything else you need.
 
 Thanks,
 
 
 John
