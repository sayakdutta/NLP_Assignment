 Hi Andy
 
 I read through all of your Article this weekend .
 
  What a job!
 
 I will forward to you this afternoon or first thing tomorrow an electronic
 copy of my suggested changes, which also attempts to pick up those given to
 me by Dede.  After you receive it, I thought it might be helpful to talk
 over the changes so you can see where I was coming from.
 
 Thanks
 Elizabeth
