 
 Mike,
 
 Great idea.
 My son built his own computer. He can help.
 
 Also, we are meeting Greg for 10 mins on Monday.

 Vince,
 
 The MetBox is performing as per our high expectations - Adam and Chris
 got it up and running in an unbelievably short time, we were able to
 make a great call on Tropical Storm Barry, the termination of the recent
 heat wave, it seems to have resulted in more highly skilful 6-10 day
 forecasts already (based on our weekly look-backs), we're getting critical NWS
 update information 10 min sooner than the web or outside services, and
 are progressing well on internal modelling efforts.
 
 Along that line, we are ready for what we call the MM5 box, really just
 a computer built just like the MetBox, but souped up for the specific purpose of being dedicated to
 feeding off the MetBox and cranking model scenarios. It will also serve as a backup.
 
 If we bought it from PDI, it would be about 10K, but we (Chris & Adam)
 can component together a replica of the MetBox for $3600. 
 
 IT says this computer product is too specialized for them to acquire and build.
 
 We do the impossible daily.
 
 If you would like a verbal review, we can get together at your convienence.  Or if the attached .doc and .xls files are sufficient, just give me the word and consider it done.
 
 Mike
