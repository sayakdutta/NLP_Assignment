 Dorie, I have to question the effectiveness of this program.  Over the year=
 s, it appears that more spots are being filled by Enron people then custome=
 rs. The effectiveness of this forum from a customer point of view is questi=
 onable.  I vote to kill it.
 
 Please forgive the approach - but I would like to provoke a discussion with=
  my partners.
 
 Regards
 Delainey
