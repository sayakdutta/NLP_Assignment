 
 Sounds good.
 
 I'm on a conference call that won't end.  I received your fax and will try to 
 call you this afternoon.
 
 
 
 



 
  
 I received today notarized copies of the Resolutions of Support from the
 Edgecombe County Commissioners, the City Council and Mayor, and the local
 economic development organization, Carolinas Gateway.
 
 I will file them with the Commission when we file the cost data late this
 week or early next week.  That would also be a good time to file any project
 updates, such as information regarding the generators.
