 Kay,
 
 Here is the Cover Sheet and Attachments for the above C/P.  I wasn't sure 
 about the due diligence on the "agency relationship" so was unsure as to 
 whether to put those riders in.  I have attached those riders so you can 
 advise me.  The Agreement is housed in your directory minus the General Terms 
 and Conditions.  When you are ready to send the Agreement then I can attach 
 the GTC.
 
 Thanks,
 Genia
