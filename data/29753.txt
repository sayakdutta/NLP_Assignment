 
 I was thinking of you on the appropriate day but somehow I never managed to 
 let you know how much I care about you. I'm thinking of you now too and hope 
 you are happy and doing well.
 
 Love

 thank you for your sweet message.  Greg & i went to Las Vegas for 4 days &
 all my sisters & their families were there vacationing at the same time.  We
 had a great time.  Came back to work in late afternoon today - tired.  Vegas
 was actually my gift to Greg for his birthday which was a wk before mine but
 we celebrated mine there too.  Got your very nice phone message also -
 thanks for cheering up my tired mind & body.  Your voice sounds wonderful &
 i breathed in all the telephonic kisses.  Hope all is well on the road to
 retirement.  love, sue
