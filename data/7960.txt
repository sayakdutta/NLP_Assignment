 Sally,
 
 I just want to give you an update on the Executive Report Viewer project in 
 case you are not aware of the status. The development of the ERV project has 
 been completed and delivered on schedule. The feedback from the demo was very 
 positive. The application has been handed over for user acceptance test.
 
 Thanks
 
 Zhiyong
