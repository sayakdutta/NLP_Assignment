 Spoke with Joe Manogue this morning. He has been speaking to their external 
 council (S&S) daily trying to get a lined draft of the document with all 
 changes. He was supposed to get it last Friday, is now promised it this 
 morning. He plans to review and fax it out to you this afternoon, following 
 up with a hard copy by Fedex overnight. He's doing all he can to speed the 
 process along. I'll call you when I hear more from him. Per
