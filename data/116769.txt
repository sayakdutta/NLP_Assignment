 California Energy Resource Schedulers - CERS. It's been changed.

 Did you find out anything about this deal?  We really need to get this out of 
 the NEW Counterparty status.
 
 Thanks!

 This deal was entered as New Counterparty which is fine for a short period of 
 time.  However, within a few days someone needs to make sure to change the 
 deal to the correct counterparty name.  Can you look into this and let me 
 know?
 
 Thanks!
