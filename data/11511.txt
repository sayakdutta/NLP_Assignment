 
 Is this the deal you referenced at the exec comm (B) meeting ? Or is there another one. I asked my guys to check if we had seen deal. Rick
 
  
     
 The paper transaction you asked about in the staff meeting is with E.W. Scripps Company, S&P rated A/stable.  The deal has not been signed and the contract is still being negotiated.  We gave the marketers a preliminary approval based on the existing credit threshold of $10 million.  We have not valued the exposure or credit reserve since we do not have final transaction details.  
 Please let me know if you have any questions.
 Thanks,
       Ken
