 
 I have drafted the attached letter denying the Cal ISO's request to send it 
 (and the EOB) EPMI and EES' cost information for transactions over the FERC's 
 cost cap.  Since I believe we are on very firm ground, my initial inclination 
 was to send no response to the ISO's letter, so there would be nothing to 
 quote in the press.  However, I drafted this letter at Alan's suggestion for 
 purposes of discussion.  We should decide whether to send a letter before 
 distributing this draft more widely in-house to discuss how to parse the 
 message.
