 
 Matt,
 
 Hey, thanks for returning my call.  As you're probably out from work, I'll 
 try you again when I get in tomorrow (thursday).  I basically just wanted to 
 touch base again since Ken has now moved on and left me with our synthetic 
 storage project.  I'm also looking for a legal and EOL contact to help us 
 develop a contract and run the bid process through EOL.  You may have 
 provided these to Ken, but I can't get in touch with him.  Thanks again.
 
 Mat
