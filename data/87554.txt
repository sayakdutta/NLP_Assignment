 
 I have been in contact with your customer Greely regarding a GISB and or 
 Master.   It is my understanding they wish to trade firm long term  (1 year 
 or greater)   I have related to them ENA will not go past 30 days on firm 
 delivery with a GISB and suggest consideration of a Master.
 
 Please advise how you want to proceed.
