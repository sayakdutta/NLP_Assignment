 Our understanding is that FX traded from the US is effectively unregulated. 
 If we use MG London Inc, there would be the possibility that the CFTC would 
 have some type of oversight on the unregulated business. Only the posting of 
 the IMM EFPs needs to be done through the FCM.
 
 There are other practical issues here in that that MG London Inc currently 
 lacks the infrastructure needed to do the outright FX business as it has no 
 bank FX lines and no bank accounts for all the currencies. There are other 
 issues where the main settlements/back office expertise is here in London. 
 These are obviously not insurmountable but we need to do a lot of work to get 
 either MG London Inc or, for example, MG Newco Inc ready for the business. Is 
 there an angle for using Enron North America, for example, as I understand 
 they already have existing FX lines and settlements or would that be a 
 non-starter? There are currently some UK and EU customers on Wolff's books 
 who would need to be routed via an SFA regulated arranger. Will we be able to 
 use EEFT for this?

 Jon,
 
 I had a glance over the written paper from Sullivan & Cromwell as to FX 
 Transactions, and it seems to me that there would be fewer US regulatory 
 issues (should there be any), if we were to use MG Brokers Inc, the FCM 
 entity.  Are there any other reasons why we would not want to use this entity?
 
 [Mark/Alan/Marcus - I have separately sent you by email the Sullivan & 
 Cromwell paper]
 
 Thanks.
 Justin

 Jon, 
 
 My suggestion would be for the FX business be run out of a NON FCM firm in 
 the states (NY) since it is a non-regulated product.
