 Can you re-activate the Alberta Power Pool Access to EnronOnline.  Although this entity doesn't trade, it is important that they have access to the Alberta Gas and
 Alberta Power product for view only.  This is a government entity that controls important gas generators in the province. They use our info about AECO gas in dispatching these units and they are an advocate for electricity trading in the province.  Therefore, they need to see the Alberta Power market data on EOL.
 
 Thank You 
 
 John Zufferli
 
 
     
 
 Derek,
 
 Can you help us out, our guest access expired.
 I somehow don't have John's card, so I thought I'd try you.
 
 Please advise.
