 
 Hi Mr. Ramsay -
 
 In regard to your request for Ken to chair a Forum segment and join the 
 Ministerial dinner, with the Chair of the other Session in May, he said that 
 he would be delighted to participate.
 
 We look forward to receiving additional information after the Governing Board 
 has its meeting.
