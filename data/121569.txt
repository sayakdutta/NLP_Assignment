 
 I emailed chuck and told him we would be willing to take cash!!  I also just spoke with Ann Donnelly and she understands that if she wants us there, she will have to come up with something.  She is working on helping us establish the link between united technologies and calpeak as well as provide other info.  I will let you know what they come up with.
 
 Thanks for your quick responses!

 Kim -
 
 A couple of thoughts regarding Charles Hinckley's email and your pending trip to San Diego:
 
 1.  I have scoured all of United Technologies' filings and even their website.  I found exactly ZERO references to CalPeak Power, LLC.  I'm not saying that CalPeak ISN'T a wholly-owned subsidiary of United Technologies, but I find it strange that I can't find anything on CalPeak in United's filings/online info.  
 
 2.  If CalPeak is indeed a subsidiary and WILL guarantee CalPeak's obligations, then we are in great shape.  United Technologies is A+ rated, with lots of liquidity available in the form of unused lines of credit.
 
 3.  If CalPeak will not benefit from a United Technologies guaranty, then we definitely need to see their financials/management notes.
 
 Will they send you the financials/notes before you leave for San Diego?

 What's your take on this?  They want to meet with me on friday in San Diego to discuss a potential deal as we were short listed on the RFP to supply gas to the Calpeak power plants.  If we can't get credit established and contracts in their hands, I don't know if we want to waste our time - or money.  Let me know what you think ASAP.
 
 Thanks,

 CalPeak Power, LLC is a project company and is now a wholly owned subisdiary
 of Untited Technologies Corporation (NYSE: UTC).  UTC information is
 available at www.utc.com, and from the commercial rating services.
 
 It is not invisioned that CalPeak will benifit from an absolute gurantee
 from UTC; however, some credit suport mechanism will be built into the
 project and into the fuel supply agreements.
