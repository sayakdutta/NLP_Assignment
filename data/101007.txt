 
 You know I was just teasing, right?  And, no dating is definitely not a bad 
 thing.  As for being or not being fortunate enough, just remember...your good 
 enough, your smart enough and dog-gonnit people like you.  Have fun tomorrow 
 night and try up that fortune.

 I didn't say who it was.................  Hey, dating isn't a bad thing.
 I actually do it when I am fortunate enough.
