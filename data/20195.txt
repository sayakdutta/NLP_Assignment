 CLECA, CIU and the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group have also come out wi=
 th all guns blazing against the draft decision dealing with the DWR revenue=
  requirement.  They decry the lack of hearings, state that there are fundam=
 ental untruths in the decision and conclude that, "The DWR has made it clea=
 r that it needs to have a decision on its revenue requirements quickly so t=
 hat it can successfully issue bonds to generate revenue to re-pay the gener=
 al fund.  No one has been permitted to test that proposition, but it seems =
 to be accepted as fact by decision makers.  The problem is that this record=
  does not support approval of any particular revenue requirement for DWR an=
 d it certainly does not support the allocation proposed in the DD.  If the =
 Commission must act quickly, then it must act provisionally and set for fur=
 ther hearings the many questions identified here and, we suspect, in the co=
 mments of many other interested parties concerning the basis of the allocat=
 ion among the utilities."
