 Folks,
 
 John Ayres and I went through the Facility Agreement and Exhibits for the
 ESA Turbine Purchase Agreement.  There were a few edits needed on Guarantee
 Basis (F-1) and Scope of Supply Exhibits (B and N-2).  Also, one change to
 the Emissions Test Exhibit.
 
 John and I believe other than adding in the other Exhibits B-1 and H-2, this
 is ready for execution copy.  Kay, please add these in for the final
 circulation.
 
 Also, on the contract, a number of redlines were required to reflect scope
 of supply (addition of interconnect piping to cooling tower, unit liability
 amount, payment schedule adjustment and retention amount, guaranteed
 performance levels net of all GE supplied equipment aux. loads, guaranteed
 delivery schedule for purchased options.
 
 This should be ready to go, subject to a final review of the entire contract
 document.
 
 
 Regards,
 
 Lee

 Kay,
 
 I edited the Termination Schedule replacing the term Purchase Amount per
 unit to Unit Liability Amount for consistency with the new structure.
