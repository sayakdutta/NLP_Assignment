 John & Louise --
  
 See the note below from our outside FERC counsel.  We are targeting meeting with FERC Staff in DC on Thursday Jan 17.  Still aiming to also meet either Thur or the following Fri with Commissioners offices.
  
 Sam indicates that FERC General Counsel viewed expediting our application poorly for fear of appearing partial.  As important, Sam indicates that Netco may need to make concessions (in what form and manner not sure) to appease staff to not hold up our application beyond 60 days.
  
 As soon as you know the winning bidder, we will begin finalizing the FERC filing.
  
 Thanks.

          Sarah - As you and others requested, I called Cindy Marlette, Acting General Counsel at FERC, to set up a meeting re the FERC filing for NETCO.   She has set up a meeting for 10 a.m. on the 17th, with the Staff.  We talked a little bit of substance.  She was curious as to what actually was being transferrred, and knew nothing about the atructure or substance of the deal.  When I raised the subject of asking for expedition, she indicated that significant expedition was unlikely, because the Commission "didn't want to give the appearance of partiality."   I told her I understood, but that we didn't want to become the test case for the SMA standard or do anything else that would take us beyond sixty days. She understood that.    Given the ciurcumstances, I think 30 days is the very minum we can get, and that something around 60 days is more likely.   If we get our signals crossed with Staff, it could be later.
