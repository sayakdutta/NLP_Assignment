 I have now heard back from both Louise and Andy and neither one will be 
 available.  Unfortunately, Mark has now left again and I am on my way out on 
 vacation for a couple of weeks.  It might make sense for you to contact Mark 
 directly since you will be able to get to him before I can.
 
 Sorry about that.
 
 Mark

 Mark, 
 
 Just wanted to mention to you that if either Louise Kitchens, Andy Zipper or 
 Mark Haedicke are interested in participating in the Energy Bar program but 
 is not yet in a position to make a firm commitment, we can list the speaker 
 as "invited" for the first mailing and then make any corrections that are 
 necessary on a subsequent mailing that will be distributed.? Of course, the 
 Bar Association would not list a speaker as "invited" without prior 
 authorization.? Would it be possible to get back to me today on an 
 EnronOnline speaker?? Thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule 
 to provide assistance.

 Mark, 
 
 I am not sure if you had a chance to contact Louise Kitchens or Andy Zipper 
 regarding the Energy Bar Association program, but I just wanted to check.? If 
 neither of them are available, has Mark Haedicke returned from travel?? If 
 so, would you recommend that I give him a call.
 
 I know that you are very busy and greatly appreciate your assistance.
