 Sara,
 Is there a Guarantee in place by Enron Corp. for ECT Investments, Inc. 
 relating to our prime broker agreements with Goldman Sachs?  
 We are talking to Goldman currently about increasing our leverage and a 
 guarantee may be beneficial if one does not already exist.  We are unsure if 
 one already exists.
 Thanks, 
 Sheila
