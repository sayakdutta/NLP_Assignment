 
 i had a really fun weekend.  we went to chuy's and gallant knight on friday, 
 a work party and black swan on saturday, and had the super bowl party on 
 sunday.  
 
 about 20-25 people showed up to the party, so it was a fairly big success.  
 of course, you didn't show up so it wasn't as successful as it could have 
 been.
 
 how was yours?
 
 
 
 
 

    
 
 
 Hey there, how was your weekend?  And your superbowl party?  A big success?
