 repeatedly to add you to the email list.  Also, it was my understanding from 
 Mark Taylor that you would be responsible for the "structured" equity 
 derivatives (with assistance from the swap group as needed).  Please let me 
 know if I'm assuming too much.  Thanks.  Sara

 You had these documents forwarded to me.  Is this now my project?
