 Do we have a new person to cover?

 Good morning, Vince!
 
 Would you mind doing a Kaminski Column for Monday?  If you'd rather not, I 
 can probably get a "new person" piece by then.  Also, will Maureen have Part 
 2 ready for this coming week?  I hesitate to ask her myself, because I think 
 it is a sore subject now.  
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Sam
