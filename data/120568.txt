 
 Thanks for looking after this.  I am not as interested in who or how we spent the money, but more so on where our estimates were off.  The whole reason for setting up and getting approval is being accountable to the plan. 
 
 Give me a call.... when you have a moment.

 We estimated 27,700 (including 3,000 for airfare for Enron people)
 We spent 25, 096 (not including airfare or fishing or anything that was put on credit cards)
 
 I will need to get an actual cost for the airfare and anything that was expensed to be able to give you a complete cost of the event.  I will contact Jessica to get this information from her.  I will then include it and send it back to you.
 
 The bill has not been paid. As soon as I got it I put the list together for you.   I am sending it to accounts payable to get paid tomorrow.
 
 I'll get everything to you as soon as I get it.

 Thanks for file.
 
 Has this bill been paid as of yet?
 
 What was our buget vs actual for each of these events. 
 
 I would still like to reconcile all expenses... even though they were all not master billed..

 Let me know if you have any questions.
 I did not have a cost for the fishing, it was put onto Mark Whitt's credit card.
