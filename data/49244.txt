 Vince,
 
 Attached you will find a draft "thought document" based on our
 conversations yesterday.  I think that it captures much of my
 recollections.  Please edit it to your liking and pass it back to me.  In
 the next steps I have laid out a plan of action that should lead us to a
 successful conclusion and a draft by Christmas.
 
 Let me emphasize that this is a working document so feel free to modify it
 in whatever ways you think appropriate (don't be bashful--I want us to get
 this right).
 
 Have a great day.
 
 Your friend,
 
 John
