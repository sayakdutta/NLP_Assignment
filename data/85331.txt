 
 That's a good one.  This is taking on much more meaning now that she possibly 
 might be a US Senator.  Yikes.

                OVER THE HILLARY
                             * * *
 submitted by The Captain
 
 Hillary Clinton and her driver were cruising along a country road one
 evening
 when a cow ran in front of the car.
 
 The driver tried to avoid it but couldn't - the cow was killed.
 
 Hillary told her driver to go up to the farmhouse and explain to the owners
 what happened.
 
 About an hour later, the driver staggered back to the car with his clothes
 in
 disarray.  He was holding a bottle of wine in one hand, a cigar in the other
 
 and smiling happily.
 
 "What happened?" asked Hillary.
 
 "Well," the driver replied, "the farmer gave me the wine, his wife gave me
 the
 cigar, and their beautiful daughter made mad passionate love to me."
 
 "My God, what did you tell them?" asked Hillary.
 
 The driver replied: "I'm Hillary Clinton's driver, and I just killed the
 cow."
