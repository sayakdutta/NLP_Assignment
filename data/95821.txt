 Here is what we sent TVA last year when we were notifying them of the 
 delivery points we would have delivered to.  I'm tied up in meetings the rest 
 of the day and we want to start notifying TVA of the delivery points we would 
 have used had we had an obligations to continue to schedule and deliver 
 energy under the MOPA,  Could you please revise accordingly and send back to 
 Bill Rust and me this afternoon,  We would like to start sending out tomorrow.
 As always, thanks for your help.

 Elizabeth,
 
 Here is the document I want you to review.  We want to send TVA a notice each 
 day showing the interface that we would have delivered, had TVA called.  We 
 need you to change/add the wording for this purpose.
 
 Thank you,
 Bill Rust
