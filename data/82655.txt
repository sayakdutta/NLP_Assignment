 
 So nice to hear from you.  I miss not being able to see you and talk with you 
 on a regular basis.  I hope the kids are dong fine.  Jordan went to 
 children's church this Sunday and he definitely asked about Taylor.  He just 
 starts smiling when I mention her name.  That little mannish boy already 
 likes girls, I think.    Anyway, things are going okay, I'm still leaning 
 toward trying to find a part-time position next year.  This job is so very 
 hard!
 
 Take care!
