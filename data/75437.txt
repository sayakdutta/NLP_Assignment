 The teacher gave her fifth grade class an assignment:
 Get their parents to
  tell them a story with a moral at the end of it. The
 next cay the kids
  came back and one by one began to tell their stories.
 
 Janey said, "My father's a farmer and we have a lot of
 egg-laying hens.
 One time we were taking our eggs to market in a basket
 on the front seat of
 the pickup when we hit a bump in the road and all the
 eggs went flying and
 broke and made a mess.
 
 "And what's the moral of the story?" asked the teacher.
 "Don't put all
 your eggs in one basket!"
 
 "Very good," said the teacher.
 
 Next little Lucy raised a hand and said, "Our family
 are farmers too. But
 we raise chickens for the meat market. We had a dozen
 eggs one time, but
 when
 they hatched we only got ten live chicks and the moral
 to this story is,
 don't count your chickens until they're hatched."
 
 "That was a fine story Lucy
 
 Johnny, do you have a story to share?"
 
 "Yes, ma'am, my daddy told me this story about my Aunt
 Karen. Aunt Karen
 was a flight engineer in Desert Storm and her plane got
 hit.  She had to
 bail
 out over enemy territory and all she had was a bottle
 of whiskey, a
 machine gun and a machete. She drank the whiskey on the
 way down so it
 wouldn't
 break and then she landed right in the middle of 100
 enemy troops. She
 killed seventy of them with the machine gun until she
 ran out of  bullets,
 then she killed twenty more with the machete till the
 blade broke and then
 she killed the last ten with her bare hands.
 
 "Good heavens," said the horrified teacher, "what kind
 of moral did your
   Daddy tell you from that horrible story?"
 
 "Stay the Hell away from Aunt Karen when she's been
 drinking."
