 provide the input on the document.  If it would be better to have the call 
 before let me know, and I will try to set it up.  I'm free tomorrow am if 
 that is a good time for you.

 Kay -- We've started on a draft of the Credit Agmt, but it will have a lot of 
 holes in it.  Have there been any further discussions re:  the specific terms 
 of the loan (financial covenants, etc.), how the guaranties will work, etc.?
 
 Thanks!  Heather
