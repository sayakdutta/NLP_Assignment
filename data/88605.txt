 
 I have reviewed the special provisions for the GISB,  we agree to your 
 provisions however, I have a question with regards to no. 6.  The last 
 sentence states, " ..each party agrees that either party may use these 
 recordings in its business affairs as it deems appropriate."  My concerns are 
 founded in the use of "these recordings".  As the GISB does not have a 
 provision for confidentiality we are concerned with the use of these 
 recordings.  Also,  we want to be the confirming party.
