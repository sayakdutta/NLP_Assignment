 Just a note to confirm that you are on board with bringing Kelly "Brant" Reves into the group in Realtime.  Don indicated that he discussed it upon my suggestion spoken to Bill Bradford in Credit.   Bill indicated that while Brant rated a "4" he was a solid performer and Don felt based on what he heard that Brant would be a good fit for our group.  Are you comfortable?  Do we need to do a confidentiality agreement with him as we have done with the other internal transfers? And, if yes, do you want to offer any cash with this one as we have done with some of the others?
