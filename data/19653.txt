 
 Yesterday, Riordan kicked things off in California.  He focused squarely on energy.  He made three key, and interesting points. 
 
 The contracts Davis signed are a huge mistake for California that must be fixed.
 If elected, Riordan would immediately eliminate Davis' Public Power Authority.
 If elected, Riordan would have California join a west-wide RTO.
 
 I'll try to rustle-up some press accounts of his remarks.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
