 
 Rod - can you tell me who the current proposed reference entity is and how it 
 is related to the Duke companies that are parties to the confidentiality 
 agreements listed below?  I need to know who the parents are and who the 
 subsidiaries are and, if it is a subsidiary if it is a material sub of the 
 reference entity.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Mark

 Mark, herewith the list I referred to in my last email.  I've looked to see 
 if there are any CAs with a Duke entity with an Enron European entity and 
 there are none.
 
 We ought to come up with a streamlined procedure for approving new reference 
 entities (rather than having it attacked contemporaneously on all sides by 
 several departments).
 
 Thanks, Edmund
