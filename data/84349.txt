 
 Attached are the revised drafts. 
 
 Please note the following:
 
 1.  I revised the FERC language but haven't yet talked to Drew about this 
 concept.  He is in Houston somewhere and I have a call in to him.
 
 2.  The Equivalent HP concept was removed.  Thus a Force Majeure or Utility 
 interruption event will interuppt the Compression Services Charge.
 
 3.  Please review the unwind language carefully in the Conversion Agreement.
 
 4.  I added an arbitration provision.  This is standard in ENA or affiliate 
 contracts.
 
 The O&M form will follow shortly.
