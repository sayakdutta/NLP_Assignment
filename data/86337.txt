 
 We currently do not have the curve information you need. Further, the curves I looked at in your spread sheet do not look good.
 
 
     
 
 
 
 

  
 
 
 Paul -
 
 Could you please get 3 broker quotes for the volumes & locations in the spreadsheet below ?
 
 We need the quotes for the purposes of validating our internal curves and making E&Y more comfortable with our OXY valuation.
 
 Thank You.
