 
 I said on this AM's call that today is the deadline for Davis to sign or veto bills.
 That was not entirely correct.
 That deadline applies only to so-called "regular session" bills.
 The bill in question (SB18XX--Burton) was passed as part of the Legislature's "emergency," or "special," session.
 Apparently, "emergency session" bills do not fall under the October 15th deadline.
 Davis has nonetheless said he intends to veto the bill, though the pressure to renegotiate the contracts is increasing from all sides.
 We'll report back on signing deadlines for bills passed on as part of the "emergency" session.
 Bottom line: Today's deadline for regular session bills does not apply to SB18xx, or to other emergency session bills.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
