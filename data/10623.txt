 Steve and Lynn - Both of you got away before I could wish you each a very merry Christmas.  I also wanted to thank you for traveling to Omaha for the meeting yesterday.   I really appreciated it and your contributions to the meeting.  I am looking forward to working with you both o this project.
 
 You and your families all have a GREAT Holiday season!!!
