 have Keith and Ray briefed and ready to answer all FERC's questions without 
 deferring any to other people.  Ray and Keith, please talk to Gary Zahn and 
 make sure you are up to speed on everything FERC has asked for and focused on 
 so far.  You don't need to be an expert on all that, but a basic 
 understanding of what they have already looked at will help you be more 
 responsive to what they want to ask you about.  If you do get stumped, try to 
 defer the question by telling FERC you need to check on a fact or two and can 
 answer that question after a break or at the end of the interview.  By doing 
 that , you should be able to get them the information they need without 
 having them cross examine a bunch of other people.  Inevitably, if you ask 
 enough people the same question, you may start getting different answers.  
 Lee, I'd like you to be on the phone call with Ray, Keith and Gary to discuss 
 generally what to be ready for and what FERC has already looked at.  Please 
 let me know if anyone has any concerns about this approach.  DF

 Today, I received a data request (attached) which provides more specifics on 
 the interviews to be conducted in Omaha. Please note that they have asked to 
 meet with Keith Petersen and Ray Smith on an individual basis.  If the FERC 
 deems it necessary, they will interview individuals that report to them.
