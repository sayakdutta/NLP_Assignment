 the status with his immigration?  Could we be in a scenario that he has to 
 work our of canada for a while?

 Jeff,
 
 Jane Allen and I met with Doug today to discuss the green card procedure for 
 he and his wife.  We will start this process immediately, but it's a long 
 road - approx 2.5 years.
 
 Doug asked if we would be willing to cover immigration attorney fees for his 
 wife should she find an employer willing to file for a work permit, but is 
 unable to pay legal fees of  $2-3,000.  It is fairly common that Enron would 
 cover legal fees for the spouse in this situation, but I will need your ok.
