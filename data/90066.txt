 Kevin - As you may know, Saji is now over at EBS but due to the general uncertainty is looking around for opportunities.  I have spoken with him and think he will be interested in coming over to help but when he relocated last year he committed (contractually) to stay with the group for a year - He is waiting a few of days to make a decision because he anticipates a redeployment.  I told him we could use his help immediately and am trying to get him to make a decision.
 
 I wanted to warn you that he may be calling - I am interested in having him if we can get him away from EBS.  Thanks!
