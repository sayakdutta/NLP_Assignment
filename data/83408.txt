 I am the executive recruiter you spoke to today about new job opportunities.
 Thanks very much for your time.  As discussed, I've attached my contact
 information for your records.  Please send your resume back to me in Word
 format and let's make arrangements to discuss your background and interests
 in new job opportunities.
 
 You can find more information about my firm at www.firstcallassociates.com.
 We are very familiar with the nuances of the energy trading business and
 have built relationships with many energy companies in North America
 enabling us to present qualified employees for their consideration.
 
 Most of our candidates (as you were) come referred to us by people we have
 worked with in the past.  If you know any good people in front, mid or back
 office positions who may be interested in new job opportunities, feel free
 to pass along my name or let me know how I can contact them.  Any referrals
 that result in placements will not be forgotten.  Thanks again and I look
 forward to speaking with you soon.
