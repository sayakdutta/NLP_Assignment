 
 Thank you for the confirmation.  I assume that I am not charged until you 
 ship.  Is this correct?

 Dear Ms. Shackleton:
 
 Thank you for your recent order placed at
 www.bravo.com.  Bravo 20 has recently merged with OFFI
 & Company.  During this transitional period, our time
 between order receipt and shipping is longer than
 usual, as we are in the midst of manufacturing and
 re-stocking.
 
 Due to this delay, the approximate shipping date for
 your order is 7/25/00, although we hope the actual
 ship date will be earlier.  Please do not hesitate to

 if you have any questions or if we can be of further
 assistance.
 
 Thank you,
 OFFI & Company
