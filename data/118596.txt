 
 I have been able to access this but our outside legal counsel (Sullivan & 
 Cromwell in NY) can't.  Any way for them to get access so they can advise us 
 on this?  They are also the guys who will help with a training session on 
 various legal issues and company policies in trading.

 Mark,
 
 As discussed, here is the URL for the proposed web site:   
 http://ecthou-lndev1.nt.ect.enron.com/westpowernet.nsf/
 It is still on an internal server which I hope you will have access to.  Let 
 me know if it doesn't work.  
 
 The User ID is: "user1"  and the Password is:  "test"  .
 
 I also ran through several of the web sites from which we gather our 
 information and did not run across the occurance of any copyright statements.
 
 In terms of timing, we hope to release the site by the end of January to a 
 limited customer listing.
 
 Regards,
