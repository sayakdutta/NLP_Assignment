 I checked out the whiskey on Saturday. Pretty cool club but the music has to go. And the whole no one under 35 policy really detracts from the talent. Mike is coming to town on Saturday and we are going to hit the town. Talk to you later. I have an excellent instilling jealous rage in the ex story for you but I'll save it to tell you in person.

 apparently if you're so pissed you can't talk and the only place you can get into is the drink, girls are not going home with you. it sucked so i left pretty quick.  sorry i dragged you out.  i'm moving saturday so i'm not going out that night, but i think we might be going to the whiskey tonight.  after last weekend, i'm not expecting much though.  anyway, talk to you later
