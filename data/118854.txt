 
 The PA and ETA for Japanese counterparties will be identical to those for 
 North America unless they need revision for some commercial reason.  I will 
 try and get to the FAQ's tomorrow.

 How are things going?
 I just wanted to make 2 requests:
 
 * Could I have your notes re: legal FAQ ASAP
 *  I have a copy of the PA from the EOL site. If there were any revisions 
 made to it in order to customize for the Japanese launch, could you please 
 send me an electronic copy
 
 Thanks
 Rousseau
