 Kevin,
  
 Thanks for the access.  Although, I am also needing access for two analysts in the group - Todd Litton and Erin Willis.
  
 You had given access to Jaime Gualy, an associate, but he rotated out of the group in mid-June.  If you agree with the two analysts listed above, the following individuals in the Equity Group would have access to the curves:
  
 Michelle Ruch (already has access)
 Heather Kendall
 Danielle Romain (already has access)
 Todd Litton
 Erin Willis
  
 Thanks,
 Heather

 Heather, please have your assistant submit an eRequest for access to the curves and structuring model (Chaun can help if you need it)

 Please grant Heather Kendall access to East Power Curves
