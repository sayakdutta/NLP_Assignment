 
 Carol,
 
 Susan is out today.  Is what you want just a full set of the ISDA documents?  
 Do you need a binder of our internal forms as well?  I have a bunch of 
 trainees coming thru so Taffy just made up a bunch of new sets of ISDA 
 documents and is 3 hole punching them and putting them in the binders...Do 
 you want them messengered out to your home, or just available for you when 
 you get back to the office?

 Tana and Susan:
 I would like to keep some of my swap binders here at home so I can use them.  
 Could someone make up a set of binders for me with all of the forms, ISDA 
 definitions etc. that I can use at the office?  I'm hoping that with all of 
 the new lawyers an extra set of the materials that we give to new lawyers and 
 legal assistants is readily available.  Thanks for your help.  See you on the 
 8th.
 
 Carol
