 Hope you're doing alright.  I received a call from NY and before I called 
 back, I checked the infamous Lotus Notes.  It seems that you were going to 
 send a letter to NY summarizing the outstanding issues (I think there was 
 only one issue).  Please let me know if this was ever done.  Thanks.
 
 On a sad note, I don't know if you heard but Samantha's 19-month old daughter 
 (adoption not final) was killed in a tragic car accident last week.  The 
 child managed to crawl under the car while it was in the driveway and Sam 
 didn't see her.  Did you really get to know Samantha?  If so, and if you 
 would like her home address, please let me know.
