 
 To all,
 
 As you know, Enron is refinancing the equipment we bought through WestLB.  
 I've been asked to compile a list of all the equipment purchased through 
 WestLB, and the change orders related to same.  All I know about is the LM 
 deal with GE (with 1 executed change order, approximately 4 or 5 pending) and 
 the ABB transformer deal (with one CO pending).  Please let me know if you 
 are aware of any others.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
