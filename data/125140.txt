 Bill,
 
 We haven't missed it for a long time, but thanks for the heads up.

 Good afternoon.
 We have recieved significant amounts of congestion revenue on real-time for 11/13. Please use the inc sheet or CAPS to settle in the morning. The inc sheet has correct pricing and schedule ID's.
 
 Thanks,
 Bill
