 LSU Is Ranked Party School Champ
 Distinction Disappoints University  Officials
 BATON ROUGE, La., Updated 9:13 p.m. CDT August 16, 2000 --It's a  distinction
 officials at Louisiana State University wanted to avoid, but now  the word is
 out: LSU has been ranked the No. 1 party school in the Princeton  Review of
 the nation's top colleges.
 Despite seminars on alcohol abuse and  new policies for fraternities and
 sororities regarding alcohol consumption,  LSU edged out the University of
 Alabama for the top spot. The University of  Texas "won" third place.
 Chancellor Mark Emmert said LSU is no more a party  school than any other
 university.
 The Princeton ranking was disheartening  news to university officials still
 shaken after the Aug. 19, 1997, death of  an LSU student who drank
 excessively during a celebration of his acceptance  into a fraternity.
 Brigham Young University was dubbed the top "Stone Cold  Sober" school in the
 review.
