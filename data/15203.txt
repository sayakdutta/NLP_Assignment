 wonderful evening we had and thank you for being such a thoughtful son.
 Drillion was just great.  I have never seen anything like it!  After seeing
 Drillion a regular circus would be dull and boring.
 
 The Old Warsaw was everything you described and more.  Fur coats and big
 diamonds are still in style and I saw plenty of them at the Warsaw.   The
 service was impeccable, the music was soothing and relaxing, and I've never
 eaten a better meal.  Dad had the lobster thermador and I had the
 tenderloin.  Everything was absolutely perfect.  The young man at the table
 next to us proposed to his girlfriend and the ring was hidden under grapes
 in a silver goblet.  It was very romantic and the staff made a big
 production of it so we all enjoyed it.
 
 I wanted to call you this morning to thank you but I know things are in
 turmoil at work and I didn't want to disturb you.  We will call this
 evening.
 
 Your wonderful gift was very much appreciated and enjoyed by both Dad and I.
 
 Love,
 
 Mom
