 arose which I am not able to get out of.  In my absence, I asked Christian 
 Yoder to help out (general Enron thoughts) and Randy Osteen (Constellation)  
 to speak about the EEI "Into Product" if the group wants to understand  a 
 little of the history behind it and how the product works (Randy actively 
 participated in the review and formulation of the Into Product as well.
 
 Sorry again for missing the meeting.
 
 Talk to you soon.
