 
 Attached are the draft message points.  As always, all comments, suggestions, 
 etc. are encouraged and welcome.  I have five minutes.  Consequently, based 
 on what other panelists say, and general tenor of the hearing, may end up 
 emphasizing some points more and others less in opening, and use any Q & A to 
 round things out.  Joe/Mary:  any final word on format/participants?  Thanks.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
