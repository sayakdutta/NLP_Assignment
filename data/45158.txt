 
 Do you have access to the Financial Trading Agreement database, where you can 
 look these dates up?

 Tana,
 
 Can you please confirm for me what the financial master agreement dates are 
 for Utilicorp United Inc (GCP shows 6-21-00) and Dynegy Canada Inc (GCP shows 
 6-16-95)?  
 
 Canada currently has several confirmations that are being held until we can 
 resolve what the dates are.
 
 
 Bernice
