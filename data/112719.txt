 RE: EEI Interconnection Project
        ?Conference Call on Friday, September 28th at 11:00 a.m. 
         (EDT)
 
 EEI has recently undertaken an effort to draft Model Interconnection Procedures for new generators, along with a pro forma Interconnection and Operating Agreement.  They have recently distributed those documents to EPSA, as well as other industry trade associations, in an effort to get feedback from other industry groups.  It is, however, unclear when EEI's efforts will be shared with the FERC Staff.
