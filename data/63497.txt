 Rosalee, please throw away the earlier e-mail as it
 appears someone, meaning Jose Luis, didn't check their
 references.
 Thanks
 Liz

 I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but this is a hoax:

 Here's an excerpt from the U.S. Postal Service's published response:
 
 A completely false rumor concerning the U.S. Postal Service is being
 circulated over the Internet via e-mail.
 The e-mail message claims that a "Congressman Schnell" has introduced "Bill
 602P" to allow the federal government to impose a 5-cent surcharge on each
 e-mail message delivered over the Internet. The money would be collected by
 Internet Service Providers and then turned over to the Postal Service.
 
 No such proposed legislation exists. In fact, no "Congressman Schnell"
 exists.
