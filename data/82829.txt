 
 Girl, so now you see!  Karen just has issues!  So how are you doing?  I was 
 on vacation on Friday and didn't get a chance to respond until today.
 
 We were in Chicago this weekend for my husband's family reunion.  The weather 
 was great compared to Texas.  Texas is so hot!!  How's Christian doing?  My 
 boys are doing pretty good, just growing so fast.
 
 Tell me more about Karen whenever you get a chance.
 
 See ya!
