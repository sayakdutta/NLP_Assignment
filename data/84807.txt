 
 Hello,  I am an attorney at Enron North America Corp.  I have recently been 
 asked to coordinate our hiring of summer clerks.  Monica Jordan previously 
 had handled these duties and informed me that she had used the HBA Minority 
 Committee through which to do some of our hiring of clerks.  
 
 I am looking for information concerning this program; such as how it 
 operates, when it meets. etc.  Any information you could supply would be 
 greatly appreciated.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Gerald Nemec
