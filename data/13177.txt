 John:
 
 As we discussed, I am sending you a letter summarizing the law related to
 double-breasted issues, with particular focus on operating two companies in
 the same geographic and project market.  I also have included some
 information, as you requested, about the potential liability if the efforts
 to maintain double-breasted status fail.
 
 I will send the original of this letter to you by mail.  I have copied this
 letter to Michelle Cash but have not sent it to anybody else in your
 organization because of your prior comments about David Lund's direct
 contact with me.  Let me know if you want me to forward a copy of this to
 David, Rick Johnson, or anybody else.
 
 If you have any questions about this letter or this topic in general, please
 let me know.
