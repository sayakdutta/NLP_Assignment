 
 Hey Sam,  Actually it comes out every weekend as much as I try to control it.  I had a great time.  We will have to do that again sometime! 
 
  
     
 
 In addition to the previous email that I sent to the group, you all know that as the "sole survivors" of Friday night, I had to send you a separate email:
 
 Mike: Thank you, thank you, and thank you? for your wisdom, encouragement, and especially for letting me out of having to "wax on - wax off."
 
 Coralina (the "Closer") Rivera:  Call me, we must go dancing again.
 
 Gerald:  It was fun to see the party animal side to you, I knew you had it in you despite your conservative office demeanor.
 
 John:  It is your pool table now? "TH--WACK!"
 
 Stephen:  We are forever in your debt for introducing the Gallant Knight to us.
 
 
 Keep in touch,
 Sam
