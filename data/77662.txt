 How about 400 this afternoon? I have another call at 230, but it should be 
 over by then.

 Kay - attached is Roy's writeup on our Hub Agency discussion last week.  Let 
 me know what your schedule looks like today.  If you have time, I would like 
 to go through this with you and David to get your thoughts and kick-off the 
 drafting.  
 
 Thanks,
 
 Gregg
