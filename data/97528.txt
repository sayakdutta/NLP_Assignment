 Richard-
 
 I bought an apartment complex in Abilene (clearly trying to be like
 Patterson).  The energy bills-all bills paid-are outrageous.  I am thinking
 of getting a long term contract to cap energy costs.  Big question is
 whether Texas rates are going to skyrocket?  Your opinion would be greatly
 appreciated and rewarded with a free lunch at location to be determined by
 you.
 
 Doug said you came to town recently.  His son is on David Schmidt's team.
 Tell Enron to relocate to the Fort.  It could rename Lagrave Field, Enron's
 Lagrave Field.
