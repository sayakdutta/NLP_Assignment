 The Carthage meters to report on EOL are listed below:
 
 Tennessee				4603001
 Texas Gas (Firm take away only)	4021021
 Koch Midstream				4602001
 Koch Gateway				4601003
 Lonestar Header				4609001
 Reliant					4082006
 EPGT Texas Pipeline (PGE Texas)	4615002
 
 
 
 There are a couple of meters in the hub, but the capacity is limited.  So, we should not list them.  Let me know if you have any questions or need additional info.
