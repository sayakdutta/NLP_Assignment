 Re:       October Meeting at Silverado Country Club & Resort
 
  
 
 Charles Morgan and I would like your opinion about whether the Committee
 should postpone or cancel our Fall meeting at Silverado due to the recent
 tragic events in New York and Washington, DC.  The Executive Committee has
 put together a great program and set of events, but we understand that
 people may want to change their travel plans in response to recent events.
 Please let us know your view on that and whether you still plan to attend
 the meeting by replying to this e-mail by close of business Friday,
 September 28th. Thank you.
