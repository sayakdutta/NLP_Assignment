 
 Greg,
 
 Blake Johnson sent me this proposal (I think some of his friends are
 the founders of this group). It looks like a good project for Brad Romine
 to evaluate it.

 Vince,
 
 Here are the overview Powerpoint slides for the investment and strategic
 relationship management firm, Azure Capital, I mentioned in my voice
 mail.  The transactions they completed in their past lives at CSFB and
 already in the new firm, as well as their advisory board are probably
 the strongest evidence of their capabilities.
 
 Hope all is well.
 
 Blake
