 
 Sorry I didn't get back to you on this sooner - Mike Swerzbin talked with his 
 SCEM trader that day, and they agreed to both of these deals. Just to 
 clarify, there are still two EOL trades that net out these direct trades. All 
 four are good. Direct trade deal numbers are:
 
 493989
 Sell SCEM
 Jun-01
 198.00
 Mid-C
 
 493988
 Sell SCEM
 Jun-01
 195.00
 Mid-C
 
 Let me know if SCEM back office still has no record of these. Otherwise, 
 they're good to go.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate

 Mike Swerzbin is going to contact the trader at SCEM - these are good deals. 
 They were originally done on EOL, then changed to direct trades. Once they 
 talk, I'll get back to you and let you know if they decided to keep or kill 
 the deals.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate
