 
 Hello, Steve!   Thanks for the alert!    I did just call the Pro Shop one 
 more time and spoke with a young lady by the name of Ashley, and she confirms 
 that you guys are slated to tee off on Sunday at 8:15AM on the Old Course off 
 #1.
 
 Hit  'em straight!

 Thank you Cindy!   I check with Raveneaux this morning as I was already
 there.  The Pro Shop said there was no tee time for Horton.   I am sure they
 just over looked it.  Just in case however,  I reserved a 9:45 am on the New
 Course as a backup.  You may want to double check with the Pro Shop.  Thank
 you again.  Please meeting you via e-mail.
 
 Best regards.
 Steve Westlund
