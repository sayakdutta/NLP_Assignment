 
 Skilling will be speaking at the National Press Club next week.  He'll give 
 an overview of Enron's business, talk about what's going on in power markets, 
 and what should be done to fix the current problems.  California will get 
 covered as well.  Other than what we have already discussed, is there 
 anything Jeff should know or address in his remarks?
