 Dear Jim,
  
 I spoke with Joyce Gillespie at The Lyons  Foundation who indicated the following are on their board: Jim Prentiss (Enron),  Judge Phil Peden, and R.A. Seale.  
  
 We are asking this foundation for $5,000 support of   our education and outreach programs (deadline Nov. 1) and I'm  slipping in information regarding our Allison relief needs though not asking for  specific help at this point.  Since our records are still drying and  inaccessible, I've asked her to supply a summary of previous  support.
  
 Do you know any of these trustees and could you  send a support note on our behalf?
  
 Sally J. Tyler
 Director of  Development
