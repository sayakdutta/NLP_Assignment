 84 millionaires that they would be splitting $250,000. If only he knew how 
 hard it was to get that paltry sum out of Enron. Although I did not talk to 
 him, Haedicke tells me that Jim Derrick was very hesitant about making any 
 offer. Given Jim"s attitude and Ronny's flippant response, I doubt very 
 seriously that we will be pushing settlement---certainly I won't be. Press 
 on.
