 The following volumes are capacities west of Station 1 that will result fro=
 m tie-in construction work slated for the Red Rock expansion.  Tie-in assem=
 blies will be required on both the Mainline and Loopline at stations 1, 2, =
 and 3.  New block and side valve assemblies for new compressor and scrubber=
 s will be installed on the suction side main and loop lines at each station=
 .  The tie-in will entail blocking (isolating) a line segment within the st=
 ation yard on the suction side (each line done separately) thus creating a =
 dead leg back to the next upstream block valve crossover(s).  Hence, all of=
  the flow will be forced into a single line when making tie-in on the adjac=
 ent pipeline line.  The result of forcing all volumes into a single line wi=
 ll produce greater pressure losses in the operating segment to the existing=
  compression and reduce throughput due to lower suction pressure and respec=
 tive horsepower limitations.  Discharge piping at the station having tie-in=
  work will be unchanged regarding valving configurations.
