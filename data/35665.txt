 
 The sale to PSE&G is in the New York book.  Judy is trying to get Transco to bill PSE&G directly for the demand charge.  We are still waiting to hear from Transco.

 A physical forward deal with the reimbursement amount entered as an external fee in Sitara.  PSE&G would be buyer and TP-2 is seller (assuming this is a TP-2 deal).    What is the term of this deal?  Is commodity reimbursed also? Please confirm desk , provide details and I will enter the deal.  
 
 Thanks,
 Brenda
 
 
 
 
    
 
 	   		
 
 
    
 I just added the PSE&G demand charges on Transco to our capacity worksheet.  The net impact is $0 because I'm also showing this as a reimbursement.  How should we put this in Sitara.  I'm showing a transport demand charge on the capacity deal ticket.  How do we get the money back from PSE&G?
