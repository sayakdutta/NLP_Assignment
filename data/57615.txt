 why doesn't IT just take care of this without a charge? This is not an 
 extraordinary item or special request.  This ought to be something IT simply 
 takes care of without us having to get involved or pay extra.  Am I missing 
 something?
 
 
    
  
 Steve, 
 
 The IT group put it like this..."Justification:  Current Server is  PL1850, 
 and has reached it's capacity and is non-redundant."
 
 That means that our current system:
 (1) has a slow processor
 (2) is nearly out of memory for stock award administration
 (3) doesn't have a "real-time" back up in case the hard drives fails
 (4) needs to be upgraded
 
 The IT group has quoted about $19,000 for a new system that brings this 
 server up to Enron's current server standards and takes care of the above 
 issues.
 
 Let me know if this expense is a problem and whether you need to be involved 
 with these types of decisions in the future.
 
 Thanks,
 Aaron
