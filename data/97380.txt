 
 how bouts we eat something healthy for dinner?  i'm thinking about trying to go to the store right after work.
 how does a tossed salad w/ tomatoes/mozzarella and balsalm vinegar sound....and then maybe some sort of something else...sauted breast of chick??
 
 I will be busy baking the cake.  I am just crossing my fingers that the oven doesn't wig out on me mid cake..........you might have to sedate me if that happens.
 We'll talk later.
