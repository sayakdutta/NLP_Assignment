 Contact:  Jean Munoz                FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
          916-447-8186                March 5, 2001
 
 Statement by Jan Smutny-Jones,
 Executive Director of Independent Energy Providers,
 in Response to Today?s News Conference by Governor Davis
 
 "We support the Governor?s efforts to secure power for California through
 long-term contracts =01. a solution that we?ve been advocating for months t=
 o
 help stabilize energy prices and bring down the cost of electricity.
 
 "Many of our companies were offering long-term contracts to the utilities
 last summer that would have dramatically reduced the cost of power and
 helped prevent the current crisis.  Likewise, many of our companies signed
 or are negotiating long-term contracts with the California Department
 of Water Resources.
 
 "Long-term contracts are a very important first step in the long process
 of increasing California?s generating capacity and securing reliable and
 affordable power for the state?s homes and businesses.  As the people who
 generate the power, we?re an  important part of the solution and pledge to
 continue doing all we can to help keep the lights on.
 
 "Another equally important step that must be taken quickly is to approve
 SBx1 47 which will save ratepayers billions of dollars while protecting a
 vital source of California?s electricity supply =01. the QF operators who
 provide 30% of the state?s power using clean and renewable technologies lik=
 e
 solar, wind, geothermal and cogeneration.  Most of these generators are
 small, independent businesses that have been providing power for months
 without being paid.  SBx1 47 will be an important step to ensure their
 ability to serve California customers."

 >=20
