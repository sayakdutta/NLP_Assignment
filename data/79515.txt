 Hi. Happy New Year and hope you had a good holiday.
 
 I got married in December and am now looking to leave India. I would like to 
 work in Houston because Jaya, my wife, has applied to US MBA schools for 2001 
 fall and this will mean that we can be in the same continent if not time zone.
 
 I am coming to Houston next week and was hoping that I could speak with you 
 before then about opportunities in Global Markets and if possible set up a 
 meeting with you in Houston. 
 
 
 Regards
 
 
 Sunil
