 
 Jana,
 
 Would it be possible to provide me with a list of all analysts working within 
 ENA (along with their current assignments)?
 
 Thank you.
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
    
 Let me know what you think after you have contacted them so we can move 
 forward with placement in your group.  Thanks.

 Ted,
 
 Jeanie and I met with Scott Neal (VP Gas Trading East Desk)  yesterday and he 
 mentioned that he needs an Analyst as soon as is possible.  Should I contact 
 Jana Giovannini or do you send her our request?  
 
 Thanks,
 Jennifer
