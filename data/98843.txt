 Richard: 
 
 Please see the attached draft letter to Mike Swartz.? Give us your thoughts. 
 
 Some background:? When Roland told Mike Swartz that we were not going to turn 
 cartwheels to produce Enron witnesses to, effectively, Farallon's counsel, he 
 got quite huffy.? Shortly after that, I received a call from Oaktree's 
 General Counsel reminding me of Enron's responsibilities under the Release.? 
 You may get a call also, from either Ken Liang or Brian Berman.
 
 In the meantime, as you will see from the attached draft, we have discovered 
 that the Release it clearly provides that Oaktree will not disclose anything 
 it learns from Enron to it co-plaintiff Farallon.? Given that, how can 
 Hennegan interview Brian--is he promising not to tell his client Farallon 
 what he learns on behalf of his client Oaktree?? I think we are on good 
 grounds, but we definitely should talk about this.
 
 Steve?
