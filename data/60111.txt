Australia is in bankruptcy and therefore in default of the cost sharing agreement - so we assume that's dead.  ECC is in the deal and selling its rights.   So as far as the exclusive for North America Gas and Power we are OK.  
 
 The practical issues are still huge but I thought I'd tell you this.  No-one has rung me yet.
