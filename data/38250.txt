 
 You want Zach in risk because he is better talent than what you currently have.
 
 Patti will be noming a pipe and working for Randy.
 
  
     
 Who is Zachary McCarroll and why do I want him in risk?????
 
 Also, if Randy is going to run the group, is Patti going?
 
  
     
 Bob,
 
 After discussing the potential cuts with John, Randy Gay will remain as the only transfer to Logistics from my group.  I will have him run the group at that time.  
 
 Zachary McCarroll will be transferring to west risk from my group.  
 
 Thanks,
 Mike Grigsby
