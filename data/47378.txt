 
 I just received a phone call from Paul Varana, outside counsel to the 
 referenced counterparty.  His phone number is 713/752-4514.  He said that 
 VEPCO wasn't happy with the form of GTC attached to the physical online power 
 confirms and was going to be sending me a letter requesting certain 
 revisions.  He said the letter would come from Francine Matthews at VEPCO.  I 
 looked this counterparty up in my database, and it appears that we approved 
 them to trade physical power with an override letter.  Usually, we don't 
 allow any changes to the online GTC, but with physical power & the override 
 letters, I know there is some wiggle room.  I don't know how you want to 
 handle this, if you want to wait for the letter from VEPCO to come in and 
 then deal with the issues, or head him off at the pass.  Just let me know.
