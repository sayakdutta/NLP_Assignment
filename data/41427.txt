 
 I already did.
 
  
     
 Are you sending an inquiry to Credit on the status of this?
 
  
     
 I checked and Sara sent a message to Credit on 3/26/01 but obviously has had no response.  You may want to respond to Mr. Martin and let him know that Sara did receive his message and that we were waiting on our Credit Department to respond and we will send them (Credit) another reminder that we are waiting to hear from them.
 
  
     
 
 
  
     
 Sara: I have not heard any response since by March 26th note (below).  Please confirm that you received it and will be responding.  If you can give me a time estimate that would be even better.  Thanks, -Serge

 Sara: The second FPL entity is "FPL Energy Power Marketing Inc."  It is the FPL entity that handles all trades for the non-regulated business units of FPL.    We completed the ISDA agreements between Florida Power & Light Co. (the regulated utility) and ENA in early January and I then sent you on January 9th a red-line of the FPL Energy Power Marketing Inc./ENA drafts vs. the final executed Florida Power & Light Co./ENA agreements for ease of review, since the agreements were near twins though you may also recall that we had added a guaranty of FPL Group Capital Inc  (FPL Energy Power Marketing Inc. debt is unrated, FPL Group Capital Inc debt is single A).  I appreciate you assistance in helping to move this along.  Regards, -Serge

 Serge:
 
 Sorry to take so long to respond.  A few things:
 
 (1)  What is the correct legal name of the entity you are inquiring about?
 Is it the unregulated marketing arm of the regulated utility?
 
 (2)  There has not been a commercial push from the ENA perspective to set
 up a new agreement with FPL which explains why I cannot get our credit
 goup to react.  I'll broach the topic again when  I hear from you.
 
 Please let me know if you have any other questions.
