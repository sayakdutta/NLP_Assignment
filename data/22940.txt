 John Beckworth or Mike Perrin that Senator Bentsen will be able to attend the 
 dinner at which the award will be given.  I left messages for John and Mike 
 last Friday.  Jim
 
 
 
 

   
  
 
 Hello, Mr. Derrick--Nancy asked that I send you this draft memo for your
 review/approval.  Please let me know if you have difficulty opening it
 and/or what changes need to be made to it.  Thanks.
 
 Best regards,
 
 Tom
