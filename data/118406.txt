 advice we are requesting and I would not expect it to be the lion's share of 
 the expense - presumably the update portion will be relatively easy.

 Per Shari this a.m., we had already requested an update on Ritch, Heather's 
 legal advice from another law firm in Mexico, Lopez Vallardi.  You have 
 already authorized payment of the bill.  The fax requesting an update from 
 Ritch, Heather went out yesterday.  What would you like to do?
