 
 I got frustrated in trying to put together yesterday's lunch  - our list of senior directors and above in Net Works seemed incomplete.  I thought that Murray was a senior director, and realized that his name was not on the list.  I asked Christina to verify his title and to find out if he was in Houston this week so that he could be included.  I didn't understand why he wasn't on the list.  Does he report to you?  Hope that I didn't start a series of events that is wrong.  I thought that he did report to you and that that had been the case for several months.  So I didn't understand why HR's records were not correct.  --Sally

 Mary, 
 Murray should report directly to Beth Apollo in SAP.   I was made aware of this today by Christina Valdez.   Would you please forward a SAP Web Based Form indicating the change in supervisors for Murray from Tim Belden to Beth Apollo as soon as possible and let us know when the form is submitted so I can confirm that it has been processed into the system?
 Thanks for your help in this matter.
