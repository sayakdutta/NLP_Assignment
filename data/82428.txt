 You can rest assured that I will definitely have you in my prayers.  How is everything going this morning?  What is your state of mind?  Are you feeling strong this morning or a little apprehensive?  If you are feeling apprehensive, please try and write down your questions and concerns that you have, so that you don't waste your visit by being overcome by emotions.  Call me when you get back from your visit.  I will probably be leaving here around 2:00 or so.  Call me on my cell.
 
 Love ya!
 
  
     
 I will be leaving here at noon today.  Keep me in your prayers.
