 Rick, Lou and Kim:
 I have reviewed the Enron Signature Shop website and found some items which may be good for the Laguna Fiesta.  Please give me your comments:
  
 500    Bic 4-color Pens                     $1.43 ea
 500    Enron Field Pencils                $1.25 ea
 225    Enron clear plastic mugs        $5.00 ea
 225    Enron collapsible Coolies      $1.50 ea
 500    Black  plastic tote                    $  .80 ea
 500    Enron Field key chain             $4.50 ea
  
 Lou - the total is $5452.50 (before tax and shipping) -- do you want me to charge it to co & cost center (we cannot use a work order on the form) or to your AmX?
