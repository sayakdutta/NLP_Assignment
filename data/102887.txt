 
 Attached is the cover letter.  This version incorporates the changes we 
 discussed over the phone on Friday, Stojic & Kelly's suggestions, and further 
 revisions by Shelley.  (I've attached redlined and nonredlined versions.)  
 Shelley and I might have a further revision or two with respect to footnote 
 9.  
 
 On Monday I'll be in meetings 9:30 - 10:30 and 2:00 - 4:00; otherwise I'll be 
 at my desk.  Please fax me the final version of the tariff sheets when you 
 have them (to 713-646-4095).  And, please call if there are any remaining 
 questions.
 
 Many thanks,
 Susan
