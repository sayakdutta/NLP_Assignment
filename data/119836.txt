 
 At he El Paso technical conference , one of the FERC staff guys said that full requirements is dead.  There is an awfull lot of pressure being put on El Paso at the meeting to path their system.  The full requirements customers have to submit to El Paso 4 different load profiles-Becky has the details.  It sounds , though, that full requirements may be addressed in the proceeding. However, that does not mean that any transport will open up to Arizona. The conference call was a nonevent.  I guess we are trying to find out how Socal calculates its WACOG.  So we want to put pressure on them to get details.  We want to put pressure on all of the state commisiions to allow LDC to hedge and not be punished for it.
 
  
     
 I was on vacation last week, and I just saw an email that you had a meeting/call on CA issues. Anything I need to know about?
 
 Also, FYI, I am testifying thur. before the AZ Corp. Commission on Southwest Gas's miserable excuse for an open access transportation program.  One big problem is their full requirements contract and our inability to get firm primary rights to the AZ delivery points.  Are there any sensitivities on these issues from your side that I should know about?
