 As you can see from below, I don't see how we can support the PE Advice 
 Letter.  We reserved our right to oppose it in the stip.  I think we should 
 clarify that SCE will acknowledge our full claim ($124 million) without any 
 offset in exchange for our cooperation with the MOU.
 
  


  
 Attached is our record of credit balances for Enron DA accounts, as of
 April 20.  The $84 million or so I referenced this morning is our
 calculation of what SCE owed through 1/18.  If the PE credit methodology is
 approved and applied back to January 19, then Enron would be rebilled for
 $68 million (for transmission and distribution charges), which offset
 against the earlier credit and the credit calculated for 1/19 - 4/20,
 reduces the total credit owed to $62 million.
 
 As we discussed, Jenny is more familiar than I with the details of the
 credits and will call you back with someone from our Billing/Credit group
 who is even more familiar.
