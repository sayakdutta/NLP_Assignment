 ***Take the GARP Member Survey!***
 
 
 GARP, in association with CWB, has developed the "Risk Management and
 Technology
 in the 21st Century-Member Survey".  Over the next few weeks, we will be
 collecting
 your opinions on a variety of issues about the challenges risk managers will
 face
 in the coming years.  The survey is comprehensive, and covers many aspects
 of the
 risk management industry including:
 
 *the current state of the industry
 *the technological and business issues institutions have faced in order to
 get
  where they are today and how those problems were overcome
 *how risk management will change and grow in stature due to technology
 *lessons learned
 
 The results of the survey will be presented at GARP 2000 and posted on the
 GARP
 web site shortly thereafter.
 
 The survey contains 27 questions and will take approximately 15 to 20
 minutes
 to complete.
