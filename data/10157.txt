 Maggie,
 
 I would like to submit the following suggestions for enhancements to the TMS system.  
 
   	a.  For printing Source Path and Allocation Path reports during the Allocation Process, the print function 		     should be set at permanent default of legal and landscape.  This would be a real time saver when 		    checking the allocated points for uncalled for cuts.
 
 	b.  Customers would like to have subtotals by point and a grand total  on the storage daily activity report 		     (IDD/PNR Contract Balance).  We now have the grouping to sum function, but I think this is too  time 	     consuming for our customers.
 
 	c.  In the Scheduled Quantities listings, instead of the box which now says "No cuts were found in this 		     cycle.  Do you want to continue checking?"  I think the notice for Final AM should be expanded to say 	    "Did you submit new nominations for the Final AM Cycle?  If not, please view Intraday 2 for any 		     possible cuts."  Since so few of our customers actually use the Final AM Cycle, I think this would be 		     helpful to our customers who are frequently under severe time restraints and stress when trying to 		     figure out what went wrong. 
  
 	d.  I would like a serious investigation into the time required to do manual scheduling.  The slowness of 		     the system for this procedure is tortuous.   It is also a  serious time waster.
 
 Please advise if you need further information.
