 Jeff, would this document be publically available, and how could we go about 
 getting a copy?  The CPUC web site doesn't go back that far, although I 
 assume that copies of the filed documents aren't available online anyway -- 
 just summaries.
 
 Thanks.

 Well, I determined that it is a CPUC proceeding, but I can't find this 
 document.  Can you provide a little more information, like date or who 
 filed?  This is the web site that shows the last 100 documents out of the 133 
 filed in this proceeding:
