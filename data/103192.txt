 Rod,
 
 We will be sending you the financial statements of Pluspetrol so that you can 
 analyse it and send the credit worksheet to legal so that they fill the 
 schedule and the credit support annex of the ISDA.  
 
 Pluspetrol (CayCo) is interested in signing an ISDA with ENA so that they 
 start hedging Crude Oil.  Pluspetrol is a very important company in Argentina 
 and they are one of the largest crude oil producers.
 
 We will send you the information soon.  
 
 Tks,
 
 Rolo
