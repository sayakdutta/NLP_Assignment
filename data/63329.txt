 I am sorry for the delay in getting back to you with a revision of the
 paper.
 
 Attached please find a revised summary by Tim Koller.  We hope it reflects
 well the discussion of our previous meeting. Before the next meeting, it is
 our intention to send along the longer discussion paper that would mirror
 this summary.  I suggest this next meeting take place as a conference call
 at one of the following times.  Please indicate with an "X" in the boxes
 next to the proposed dates which dates are good for you.
 
    Monday, November 20, 5 p.m. EST [ X  ]
 
    Tuesday, November 21, 5 pm EST  [   ]
 
    Monday November 27, 6 pm EST  [ X  ]
 
 
 We would like to get everyone's views in advance of this conference call,
 either in writing or by phone.  Please indicate below what your preference
 would be.  If a call is preferred, Valerie Petersen will contact your office
 to set it up.

 There will be one last meeting scheduled after the conference call meeting

 Look forward to hearing from you.
