 Hi,
 This gives you some food for thought -- think before you react.
 Love ya!

 A Box Full of Kisses
 
 
 The story goes that some time ago, a man punished his 3-year old daughter
 for
 wasting a roll of gold wrapping paper. Money was tight and he became
 infuriated
 when the child tried to decorate a box to put under the Christmas tree.
 Never
 the less, the little girl brought the box to her father the next morning
 and
 said, "This is for you Daddy". He was embarrassed by his earlier over
 reaction,
 but his temper flared again when he found that the box was empty. He
 yelled at
 her, " Don't you know when you give someone a present, there's supposed
 to be
 something inside it". The little girl looked at him with tears in her
 eyes and
 said, "Oh, Daddy, it's not empty, I blew Kisses into the box. All for
 you,
 Daddy" The father was crushed. He put his arms around his little girl and
 begged
 for her forgiveness. An accident took the life of the child only a short
 time
 later and it is told that man kept that gold box by his bed for many
 years and
 whenever he was discouraged, he would take out an imaginary kiss and
 remember
 the love of the child who had put it there. In a very real sense, each of
 us, as
 humans, have been given a gold container filled with unconditional love
 and
 kisses from our children, friends, family or God. There is no more
 precious
 possession anyone can hold.
 
 Friends are angels who lift us to our feet when our wings have trouble
 remembering how to fly.
