 
 Celeste,
 
 I would like to ask you for a favor. We would like to have Sevil as an intern 
 in our group
 this summer. She prepares a Ph.D. dissertation  on transmission: a critical 
 issue to the power
 markets everywhere.
 
 I have also a few other students I would like to take in as summer interns. I 
 shall send you 
 the resumes in separate messages.

 Hi Dr. Kaminski,
 
 As I told you last Monday in Dr. Kao's class I am
 looking for a summer internship position in your group
 in which I can use my economics background together
 with my quantitative skills and knowledge in
 electricity markets. Currently, I am a third year
 Ph.D. student at the Economics Department of  the
 University of Houston. At the end of this semester
 I'll be completing my coursework and starting to write
 my dissertation which analyzes the access pricing
 issue in network industries, especially in electricity
 transmission.
 I would like to give you a few examples from my
 coursework. In addition to basic Statistics I-II and
 Econometrics I-II, I have taken "Macroeconomic
 Modeling and Forecasting" (Time Series) class in which
 I learned RATS. In "Applied Econometrics" class, it
 was given a great deal of attention to the case method
 learning approach that involved extensive computer
 analysis. We were taught SAS. As a term paper I worked
 on electricity demand forecasting. This semester I am
 taking "Special Topics in Applied Econometrics" course
 in which I am being taught Qualitative Dependent
 Models, MLE, Panel Data Techniques, and so on, and as
 software STATA. Moreover, this semester I am also
 taking "Options Theory and Its Applications" class and
 auditing Dr. Kao's class. I definitely agree with you
 in what you mentioned in your lecture last Monday
 about the understanding of the options theory as a
 necessity in the energy sector.
 Besides, I spent my last summer in the Oil and Gas
 unit of the World Bank as a research assistant. This
 work experience in which I had great exposure to the
 energy market issues and my own research area, which
 is regulation of transmission pricing (congestion
 pricing), made me believe that the ongoing
 restructuring of the electricity sector, especially
 the transmission network issue, could be well
 understood by working in the industry.
 Dr. Kaminski, attached you can find my resume. I would
 be glad if you could find a chance to review it and
 get back to me soon.
 
 Many thanks,
