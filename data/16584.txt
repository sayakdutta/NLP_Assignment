 
 Sorry.  They're on their way.  (P.S. It's Kean, not Kane.)  And I like to 
 discuss further the points you were making on the call.  They were good 
 ones.  I just didn't want to get hung up on them during that conference call.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
 
 
 
 

    
 
 Jeff: As we discussed, please send me your's and Steve Kane's presentations.  
 Thanks.  Ron
