 TO: SGA  ENERGY ACCOUNTING/MARKET SERVICES 
 CONFERENCE REGISTRANTS
 Due to the recent tragic events, we have decided to postpone the SGA 
 Energy Accounting/Market Services Conference scheduled for next 
 week in New Orleans.
 The Conference has been re-scheduled for January 16-18, 2002
 at the Hyatt Regency New Orleans. We will hold your conference registration 
 for the new date unless notified otherwise. 
 To adjust  your hotel reservation to the new date, call Hyatt reservations 
 at (504) 561-1234.  Do not contact the hotel until after September 22, as they 
 may not have the new information in their system until then.
 Should you have any questions, please contact me or my assistant Melinda  
 Bellido at (972) 620-4020.  We look forward to seeing you in New Orleans.
 Best regards,
