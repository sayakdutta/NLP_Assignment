 I plan on attending.  Both of you should feel free.  I think that right now we should decline any offer to present unless we can come up with a set of "Guiding Principles" (i.e., prospective market rules, etc.)

 As mentioned in a July 31st memo, EPSA will be hosting a one-day roundtable discussion on the issue of market-based rate methods, as well as EPSA's forward-looking position on the subject.  The meeting will begin with lunch at 11:30 a.m., officially start at noon, and end at approximately 5:00 p.m..  Unless the group is too large, the meeting will be held at EPSA's office at 1401 New York Avenue, NW, in Washington, DC.  An agenda will be sent out closer to the meeting.
