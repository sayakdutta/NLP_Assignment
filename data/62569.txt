 Enron Industrial Markets has identifed a candidate in the London market that we wish to bring into Enron at the VP level.  He is a highly experienced individual with over 30 years of steel experience and would run the origination effort for steel in London reporting to Bruce Garner.  He has met several members of the executive committee already (see attachment) and his resume is attached to this email.  Ray Bowen will present him at the next executive committee meeting for approval.  If you have any questions or comments, please contact me as soon as possible.
