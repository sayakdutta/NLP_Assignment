 
 Larry, here is the publication we discussed.  If you have an interest, let 
 this guy know. 
 Thanks and welcome aboard.  Wes Colwell is looking for an office.  Right now 
 there are 2 oppts he is looking at; 1 up here on 33 which is a problem, and 1 
 office on finance floor.  Do you have a preference, if we have an option?
