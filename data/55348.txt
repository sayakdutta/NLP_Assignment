 
 Ted,
 
 We have the first running version of VaR model for the MG positions. Many 
 thanks to Tanya and Anjam for taking lead
 in this effort. We had also great help from Cantekin and Kirstee. We want to 
 validate some  inputs
 before releasing the number. Specifically, I want to make sure that both 
 London and Houston work
 with the same position numbers every day to avoid confusion.
 
 A few comments.
 
 1. We plan to set up the models to run VaR concurrently in Houston 
 (Cantekin)  and London (Kirstee) with the same inputs.
 The reason to do it this way is that we may have to respond quickly to 
 multiple inquiries in both locations. (Cantekin and Kirstee,
 please stay in touch and synchronize the inputs ).
 
 2. It is critical that we run the model daily and receive the updated 
 positions and prices on a regular basis.
 
 3. We shall continue work in Houston to improve the model. Two critical areas:
 
  a. VaR model, by its nature, does not capture one big risk MG has in its 
 portfolios. This is the liquidity risk
        resulting from different cash consequences of the hedges and the 
 underlying positions.
  b.  We should go through due diligence to validate the process generating 
 the position numbers (i.e. look
                       into the details of specific transactions).  From what 
 I know, MG has a fairly rudimentary risk
        management system and I am not quite sure how they generate option 
 prices (and deltas). They get some
                       option prices by calling brokers.
 
 4. I think the current VaR is within 80-85% of the true number (assuming the 
 inputs are right). But, as I have said,
      VaR does not capture all the risks that we have to worry about.
