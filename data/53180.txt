 Thank you for meeting me the other week when I came to Houston. As
 discussed, please find attached the draft agenda for EPRM 2002 USA which
 will be taking place in Houston on 14 & 15 May next year. I would be pleased
 to hear your opinion of the programme - in particular if you feel I have
 missed anything out or confused any of the issues.
 
 We also discussed you speaking at the event again. I do not know what your
 situation is now with the events of the past couple of weeks, but I would be
 delighted if you could take part in the conference - please feel free to
 choose any of the talks on the programme. (No titles or bullet points are
 rigid - you can alter one to suit you.)
 
 Many thanks for all your help with this. I look forward to hearing from you.
 
 Kind regards,
 
 Victoria
