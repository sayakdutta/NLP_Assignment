 
 Good luck, is it the same outfit we've been working with who handles Red Cedar's production into TW?
 
  
     
 going to "retire" and go to work contract for a small company in Columbus, TX. scheduling gas, doing some back office work, etc.
 
 Getting the hell outa dodge.
 
 Wish me luck!
 
 
  
     
 and where are you going?
 
  
     
 I will be leaving the company next Friday, March 15.
 
 Dennis Lee will be the new contact person for all new POI setups and questions related to Transwestern POI's.
 
 Elizabeth Brown will be his backup.
 
 Please direct all future communications regarding TW POI's to Dennis and Elizabeth. 
 
 Thanks
