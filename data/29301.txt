 Attached please find the February 2001 report showing current month activity 
 in the System Levelized Account (SLA).  Information for this report comes 
 from data provided by Gas Accounting Department.  Several items to note for 
 this, the first distribution:
 All non-shaded information on this report reflects the same data as shown on 
 Exhibit No. 7 which has been provided to Northern's shippers in conjunction 
 with Docket No. RP01-76-000 data requests.  (Only January data has been given 
 to the shippers at this time.)
 Columns (j) and (k) serve to highlight the segregation of the SLA account 
 into its two components - cash and future liability.  The two columns add 
 together to equal the total amount of the SLA account on the books (Column 
 (i)). 
 Column (j) reflects the cash portion of the SLA account, i.e. the actual 
 amount of cash spent/(received) in maintaining Northern's operational storage.
 Column (k) reflects the future liability portion of the SLA account, i.e. the 
 future amount of cash to be spent/(received) in clearing the Dollar Valued 
 Volume short/(long) position.  It is computed by multiplying the month-end 
 Dollar Valued Volume short/(long) position by the respective month's MIP. 
 
 This file contains both the January and February report.  To print each 
 month's report, simply click on the respective tab.
