 Sorry, a fairly basic question.
 
 Background:
 
 We have two legal entities here in Japan, Enron Japan Corp. ("EJC") and Enron 
 Japan Marketing Corp. ("EJMC").  EJMC is used just for physical trades for 
 reasons of US tax.
 
 The draft ISDA schedule we are working on lists EJC as the Enron trading 
 entity.  I am still checking how the lumber, oil and pulp trades will be 
 settled but even if they are all to be settled physically, at some stage we 
 may want to do financially settled trades with IBJ in which case EJC will be 
 the relevant entity.
 
 Question:
 
 If we will be using two Enron trading entities, do we need two ISDAs with the 
 counterparty?
 
 Thanks.

 Jane,
 
 All trades settled physically should go into Enron Japan Marketing Corp.  
 What kinds of pulp, oil or lumber trades are we looking at?  Information on 
 this would be greatly appreciated.
 
 Best regards,
 Susan
 
 P.S.  Had dinner with Heidi Mason while I was in London this week.  It 
 sounded like the opening was a success!

 Dear Susan,
 
 If we were to do any pulp or oil or lumber physical trading in Japan, should 
 this be done by Enron Japan Corp. or Enron Japan Marketing Corp.  I am not 
 clear on whether it is only electricity or all physical trading which needs 
 to go through EJMC.
 
 Thanks.
 
 Jane

 Dear Paul,
 
 I have just found out that we will be doing back to back trades for other 
 Enron companies with IBJ.  IBJ has already been talking with UK and US Enron 
 entities re pulp, lumber and oil trading but wants to have its ISDA with a 
 Japanese Enron company so we are negotiating it.
 
 What information do I need to give you so that you can check whether we are 
 authorized to do such trades?
