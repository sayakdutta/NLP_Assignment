    Sue Mara of Enron has been named the first recipient of the Kent
 Wheatland Memorial Award.  Sue was selected in consultation with many of
 WPTF's Board members because of her tenacity, forth-rightness, and
 courage.  She will be bestowed the honor on the evening of June 21 at
 our General Meeting in Ojai, and presenting the award to Sue will be
 Kent's brother, Gregg.
 
 Please join me in congratulating Sue on her selection.  You will note
 that she is not copied on this memo, but I called her this morning to
 tell her the news.  She was shocked, and honored, and almost, but not
 quite speechless.
