 
 Yeah, gave the disc to Prentice.  Also (and don't ask me how this happened, 
 cuz I couldn't tell ya), Cameron put the battery to her camera (I think?) in 
 my shirt pocket.  I gave that to Prentice last night, too.  So she's got both 
 of them.  Thanks a million (or at least $736) for the check.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
