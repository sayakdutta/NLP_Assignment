 Very sensitive info.  I asked Kristin to gather info on Select so that I could look into hiring some of their better people.  I am trying to get a more complete org picture but plan on contacting these individuals.  I will funnel the customer feedback through the appropriate channels.

 Rogers, 
 
 Per our conversation on Select Energy and their ventures in aggregate power transactions, we have gathered the following data:
 
 The key individuals overseeing Select Energy's aggregate power sales are Robert Porter, Director of Sales & Marketing (principal contact) and Terry Ranger, Manager of Contract Fulfillment (contract faciliatator).
 
 Select Energy offers aggregate power buyers bundled services such as power supply, risk/supply management, and distribution at a fixed price.
 
 A source at the Massachusetts Health & Educational Facilities Authority commented that Enron was recently out-bid by Select Energy because Enron's terms: 
 
 	*  failed to include supply to smaller lab facilities requiring only 8MW
 	*  offered only a 4.5 minute window of opportunity to strike on the quoted price & was inflexible when the hospital asked for time to coordinate with their several non-	   profits
 	* offered a price higher than Select Energy
 
 We will continue to retrieve information and finalize our findings for presentation in a company overview.  Please call with any questions.
 
 Thanks,
