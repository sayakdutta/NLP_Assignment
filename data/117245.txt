 
 I have received a bill from LeBoeuf for work done in June on the ACE 
 insurance matter for a bit over $36,000.  This included around 23 hours by PB 
 Wright ($12,000) and 38 hours by SD Avitabile ($13,000).  Does that sound 
 right to you?  I have to allocate this to the business units - should it all 
 go to East Power Trading?
