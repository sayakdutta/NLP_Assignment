 
 The information you needed for 1100, roughly 310K, should be a firm book 
 variance as well on the other side.  Portfolio accounting should have a 
 variance that offsets this(hopefully we have not already taken it, I will 
 look).  This means you will not have any actuals on it for FRED.  I will 
 start looking for dec info you just requested.
