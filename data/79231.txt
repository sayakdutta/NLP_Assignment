       At what point can we expect the CPUC and IS's to take their lumps and get on with picking at some other issues?  Hasn't Kern River done something that they can spend their time fighting about?  How do you think this one will go from here?

 For your info, we have received a protest and or reguest for Tech Conference or hearing from the CPUC regarding the USGT transaction starting Nov 1, 2001.  they raise the market power issue, the pricing, the volume, the policy of market based rates.  We expect a similar protest from IS, and also the issue regarding the alternate point use.  The volume on this transaction is for 400,000 per day with the negotiated rate provision only relating to the alternate path to Calif.   More to come.
