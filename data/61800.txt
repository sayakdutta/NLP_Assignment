 I thought that Jeff Shankman decided not to cancel and to pick up the 
 membership costs for that reason when he was in ENA?

 Hello Guys-
 
 As of a year and a half ago, Enron cancelled their membership to the AGA.  
 This has not presented a problem since we still have acess to the online 
 database as long as we are the reporting entity for the Bammel storage 
 facility.  One thing to keep in mind is that when we sell HPL, we will need 
 to subscribe to the AGA at a cost of about $100,000 per year in order to keep 
 the online access which is critical for the weekly AGA stoage numbers.  
 (Bloomberg reports the same numbers 2 minutes later, and per the traders 
 those are VERY critical seconds).
 
 Regards,
 
 Julie  :-)
