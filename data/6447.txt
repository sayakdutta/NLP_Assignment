 Eric,
 
 Is the weekly pot divided or is it winner take all?

 I would consider a deal for Taylor, but I won't give up George.  He, in my
 estimation, will be starting very soon.

 Eric,
 
 I will tell you that it will have to be an offer that I can't refuse.  You
 are actually going to maybe take the short end of the stick.  I have done
 without him for 4 weeks and he is back this coming week and I am looking
 forward to having him in the lineup.
