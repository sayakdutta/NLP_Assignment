 All:
 
 Here is a rough first cut at a DASH for a potential deal with NSTAR to serve 
 their Default Service.  Jim/Zach - please fill in all relevant numbers 
 relating to volume/pricing, etc.   Also - please begin to get RAC in the loop 
 with respect to this position and VaR impacts, etc.  Others - please review 
 pertinent sections and edit/expand as appropriate.
 
 Timing on this will likely be quick from this point and thus I would like to 
 try to have a completed draft by COB today or first thing tomorrow.  We have 
 a call with NSTAR tomorrow AM to negotiate the contract, and assuming all 
 goes well there, we could be asked to sign a binding agreement by as early as 
 Wednesday.
 
 Please call me to discuss.  978-449-9936.  Thanks
 
 John
