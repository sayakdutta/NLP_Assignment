 
 Here's the report that Sue referenced earlier.  Appears that the 
 administration's analysis of California's energy problems will continue to 
 focus solely on the "bad actor" conspiracy theory.

 		  		  summer
 
 Greetings:
 The CEC issued a report today that says that unless the ISO experiences
 "extraordinarily high" temperatures next year there is no supply problem.
 IEP is reviewing this document and will provide further correspondence as we
 prepare a response.
 
 If you have any questions please feel free to give me a call.
 Thanks,

 The Press Release:
 California Energy Commission Report Released
 
                         Summer of 2001 Electricity Supplies Better Than
 Expected
 
 
 
      Sacramento -- California should have enough power to meet its
 electricity demand next summer, unless the State experiences extraordinarily
 hot
      Weather, according to a study released today by the Energy Commission.
 
      "With new resources coming on-line and new conservation measures taking
 effect, next summer looks better than expected, if we manage our
      resources properly," said Steve Larson, Energy Commission Executive
 Director.
 
      The study, prepared as part of a response to legislation enacted in
 September, quantified the amount of electricity demand and supply expected
 in the
      summer of 2001. "We produced this analysis from the ground up,"
 commented Larson. "We looked at every power plant and source of electricity
      available to the State to give us a realistic appraisal of where we
 stand for next summer. Energy Commission staff projected expected peak
 electricity
      demand using three temperature scenarios."
 
      The analysis indicated that under the "most likely" temperature
 conditions, next year's electricity peak demand will be 47,266 megawatts,
 which reflects
      a reduction of 220 megawatts of demand because of new utility and state
 energy conservation initiatives. Operating reserve requirements add an
      additional 2,200 to 3,000 megawatts demand in order to provide a 7
 percent margin, raising the generation needed to a minimum of 50,303
      megawatts.
 
      If California experiences a warmer than normal summer, the electricity
 system will require 48,845 megawatts plus operating reserve requirements,
      which raises the total to 51,882 megawatts. Under this scenario, total
 expected resources are 52,550 megawatts. Should the State experience
      extremely hot temperatures, which has a 1-in-10 year likelihood of
 occurring, 53,104 megawatts will be needed (50,068 megawatts of demand plus
      operating reserve requirements), with expected resources of 52,190
 megawatts.
 
      An additional 1,888 - 3,087 megawatts of potential generation is
 currently under development and may be available for part or all of the
 summer.
 
      The Energy Commission's demand forecast takes into consideration
 expected economic conditions and household growth in the State. These two
      factors influence demand for air conditioning which drives summer peak
 demand for electricity. The Energy Commission's staff supply outlook
 includes
      existing in-state and out-of-state generation; new power plants
 expected to be on-line and generating electricity by August 1, 2000; and
 electricity
      imports and exports. The supply outlook also includes new renewable
 energy projects and energy efficiency measures and initiatives made possible
 by
      funding under AB 970, which was approved by the Governor in September,
 2000.
 
      California's electricity demand is growing at 2 percent per year. To
 ensure that there are adequate supplies of electricity to meet future
 demand, it will
      be important to add new, efficient generation as well as to implement
 energy efficiency and demand reduction strategies.
 
      Since restructuring occurred in March 1998, the Energy Commission has
 approved six major power plant projects with a combined generation
      capacity of 4,708 megawatts. In addition another 15 electricity
 generating projects totaling over 7,000 megawatts and an estimated capital
 investment
      of more than $4 billion are being considered for licensing by the
 Commission.
