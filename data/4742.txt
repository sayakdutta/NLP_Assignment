 I got my little review today.  It was a positive experience.  She didn't 
 really say anything negative at all- and she even commented that she felt bad 
 not giving me any constructive criticism- but that she was really surprised 
 at how good of a job I did- with only being a rotator and having such limited 
 work experience.  She said that after I finish my third rotation in EES she 
 would like for me to consider taking a permanent position in her group.  We 
 will talk about it more towards the end of this rotation.
 
 So- I am currently NOT irritated.
