 Dearest Debra,
 
 I am so sorry that I did not say bye to you on my last day, but I had to
 leave early for a school meeting. Anyway, I have been so busy with the law
 review write on competition, so I have sort have been buried in books. How
 is your new girl clerk? I know you miss having me around j/k. Please write
 back and let me know how things are going. Also, we must have lunch sometime
 this week or next. Drop me a line.
 
 Best Regards Always,
 
 Majed Nachawati
