 
 Good morning.
 
 I didn't wake Paige up this am.  I told Michael he could wake her up when he 
 wanted to, which I presume didn't take long.
 
 It feels good to be back.  Last week really wasn't a very good week to take 
 off, and I was really stressed. It helps knowing that I have a holiday in two 
 weeks!  I'm glad, since Michael is off then as well.
 
 Did you make friends with your venison (or was is pork)?
 
 Love,
 
 Kay
