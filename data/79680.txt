 Mike - I enjoyed your presentation  and comments about Enron Global Markets 
 last week.
 Your comment about being passionate about things which add value to the 
 company is important for success at Enron was very helpful.
 
 I am an originator in EIM for our pulp & paper businesses. I am starting 
 business development effort in Asia for Pulp & Paper which I am very excited 
 about. I will be in Asia visiting potential consumers and producers in major 
 countries in Asia e.g., Japan, India, Singapore, Korea, Thailand, Australia 
 and others.
 I would like to know if you recommend someone in Enron offices in these 
 countries who may have originated businesses with major pulp & paper clients 
 for other products e.g., energy or other commodities. 
 Thanks for your help in advance.
