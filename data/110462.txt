 
 Becky,
 
 Well, today things suck, but overall everything is great.  I lost about $100,000 this morning because I'm an idiot, but it's not completely my fault.  Anyway, you should definitely take an earlier flight so we could go to dinner or something.  Too bad it's not at the end of week so you could stay over, even though if you wanted to, you could.  I could leave work pretty much anytime on wednesday, so just let me know.  If you don't have my work number, its 713-853-0472.  Thanks.
 
 Mat
 
 
 
  
     
 Hey Mat - I haven't heard from you since we played phone tag about a month
 ago.  Wanted to let you know that I have a trip coming up next week and I'll
 be passing through IAH Wednesday night around 9:00.  Right now my layover is
 for only 50 minutes but I may be able to catch an earlier connection out of
 Denver if you're going to be around that night.  If you're around I'll call
 your cell on Wednesday as I'm leaving Denver & let you know if I catch the
 earlier connection and maybe you can meet me at the airport for a drink.
 Anyway, let me know what your plans are.
 
 Other than being totally swamped here at work things are good.  Matt & I see
 each other about once a month and we're going to Alaska for two weeks at the
 beginning of August.  Let me know how things are with you.
