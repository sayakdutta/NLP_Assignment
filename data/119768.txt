 Ms Tholt,
 
 
 There are two price discrepancies with the October 2001, EPNG sales to MGI Supply Ltd. First, deal number 1077216 has a rate of $1.705 on day 10/04. MGI claims the rate should be $1.80. Secondly, deal number 1093983 has a rate of $1.785 for day 10/10. MGI claims the rate should be $ 1.775. Sitara shows Jane Tholt as the trader for deal # 1077216. Can you please research and advise?
 
 Thanks
