 john, saw your CEO on the CNBC this mornng. He  looks and sounds impressive. Stock price does not seem to give a damn. From my  experience the price will show dramatic improvement once the overall tone of the  market gets better and the "California" bankruptcy situation is done  away with.
  
 However have you seen the share price of dceg  lately. I think you called it a dog not long ago. We've increased in price by 5X  since the ridiculous lows reached just before Christmas.
  
 Give my best to the family.
