 I enjoyed meeting with you too.  As I mentioned, I thought your answers were 
 thoughtful, well stated, and accurate.  In our line of work it helps to 
 triangulate using others' insights and I found yours particularly useful.

 Dear Steve and Rick,
 
 Thank you very much for inviting me to Houston yesterday to discuss Enron's
 Federal Government Affairs position.  Your vision of the role for the Enron
 Washington office fits closely with my views on what a best-in-class
 Washington operation should offer, and it was helpful to learn more about
 Enron and its business units.  Enron is clearly an exciting place to work,
 and the fact that public policy is so vital to the company's future makes
 the Washington position particularly attractive.
 
 It was a real pleasure to meet you yesterday, and I look forward to hearing
 from you again.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 
 Tim Richards
