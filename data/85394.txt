 This awesome picture was taken in Bitteroot National Forest in Montana on
 August 6, 2000.  The photographer, John McColgan, is a fire behavior analyst
 from Fairbanks, Alaska.  He took the picture with a digital camera.  Because
 he was working at the time he took the picture he cannot profit from it;
 however, we feel the picture is a once-in-a-lifetime shot and should be
 shared.
