 
 Hi Bob,
 
 I'll be sure to print your note out to Greg.
 
 I have a couple of Enron folks wanting to come tomorrow.  Do you have two 
 tickets left?

 Greg,
 
 Your keynote address hit the nail on the head this morning; it has already
 spawned constructive discussions and debates, such as what services will the
 core exchange(s) offer, what are secondary and tertiary strategies, and how
 will various companies in the value chain support and benefit from the
 exchanges.  One editor commented that your presentation offered stark
 contrast to the Chevron presentation during lunch, which was a much more
 passive "bring the horse to water" approach.  Tomorrow and Thursday's
 presentations will address many of your points more fully.
 
 Thank you very much for taking the time to drive out.  I realize how
 difficult carving a morning from your schedule can be.  However, the
 industry benefited from your insights.  Hopefully, Enron Net Works will
 receive some high-quality prospects and/or recruits in return.
 
 Yours sincerely,
 
 Bob Nimocks
