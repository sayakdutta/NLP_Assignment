 coal from you at Christmas.

 Well, it looks like I'm headed over to the coal group.  They called me up 
 after lunch and it's all just a matter of time.  (I actually think the coal 
 group cares more about emissions than power, so this might be better after 
 all).  Anyway, it appears pretty close to being a done deal.  Barring any 
 unforseen glitches, I should be up there in the next week or so.  
 
 Have fun in Mexico!
