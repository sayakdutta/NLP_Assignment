 
 Through Friday, October 12 at 5:00 pm I will be in ECN 2748.  I will move to ECS over the weekend, so if you do not get my packet to me before 5:00 on Friday, please call my assistant (Christina Valdez x39106) to get my new location for Monday.  
 
  
     
 Please email me your locations so I may deliver your packets in a timely manner.
 
 thx!

 Attached is the event sheet for interviews next week, including all confirmation numbers and event times.  Please double-check your arrival/departure dates and let Alyse know (ext. 5-7339) by tomorrow afternoon if any changes need to be made.
 
 I will see you all next week.
 
 Thanks again for all your help!
