 
 I was probably hopelessly stuck in traffic when we were to talk, and did not 
 even realize that the time had passed. Construction on my route in to work is 
 to continue until early January, and my alternate routes have proven to 
 busts.  
 
 I will call you tomorrow and see if I can catch you between issues.
 
 Thanks for making the trip to Houston with your crew last week.  It was great 
 to have people from so many different offices, supporting so many different 
 commodities -- and yet with so many similar issues.  Your support for the 
 interaction between offices is so valuable.  Thanks again for all of your 
 efforts.  --Sally
