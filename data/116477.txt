 
 Melissa Murphy would like us to begin adding a note in the comments section 
 of all the deals we change. I know most of you already do this when you make 
 big changes to deals, but she'd like to see more comments more often. Of 
 course this mostly applies to me, but I thought I'd pass it along just in 
 case. See the attached e-mail, and let me know if you have questions.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate

 Hi, I was wondering if it would too time consuming for you to add a note in 
 the comments box inside deal entry when you change a deal.  We always try to 
 put a note in the comments box so it is easier to research what has changed 
 on a trade in the future.  If you could add notes it would help us out when 
 we are researching past deals.  Let me know what you think.
 
 Thanks,
 Melissa
