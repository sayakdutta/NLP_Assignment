 I think I have the most recent verison of the North American ETA and PWA on 
 my system, but just to be sure, could you send copies to me via e-mil?  I 
 just want to make sure that I am sending out the correct version.  Some 
 potential customers of EnronOnline want to see what they would be required to 
 sign to have access to the system.
