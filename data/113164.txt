 Nancy,
 
 Thanks. That does help. 
 
 We want Option C. Let us know if there is anything we can do to ensure that option is selected.
 
  
     
 That is true in Option A and Option B.  The key to Option C is that we would have January and February meter read cycle to switch our customer before they would be switched to the affilliate as a customer who did not switch.  Option A and B, EES would not possibly get customers in TNMP and AEP if their meters are read during the first two weeks of the month.  We could send switches for Reliant and TXU for the first two weeks of the month, before the December moratorium.  Does this help?

 So.
 
 Best case - We submit on January 2 and the customers get switched on their January meter read date. 
 
 Worst case - We submit on January 2 and the customers get switched on their February meter read date.
 
 Is this correct?
 
  
     
 Yes, it is.  Do we have a lot of customers lined up in those two service areas?

 Nancy,
 
 Is it a given that we will not be able to submit any switches in TNMP or AEP until January 2?
