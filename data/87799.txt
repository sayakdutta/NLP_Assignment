 As I mentioned on the phone, our Traders (Tom Carlson and Theresa Cline) and
 our management have requested a Master Agreement for the purchase & sale of
 Natural Gas (presumably for firm sales) between Enron and Pinnacle West
 Capital Corporation, Arizona Public Service's parent company.  As I further
 mentioned, our hope is to have this Agreement in place by next week because
 our respective traders are poised to start trading under it.
 
 I have attached PinWest's Company Information Sheet which provides certain
 background and contact information.
 
 Please email the draft Agreement as soon as possible to our Contract Manager

 or me if you have any questions.  Thank you.
