 Kay,
 
 What are your feeling about Montana Power's counter?  My comment would be to 
 add a clause saying that MPC would have x (5?) many days to respond to ENA 
 once notified that the turbine is again available for sale.

 4.   If during the Term, MPC determines it does not desire to proceed with
 the purchase of the Turbine, MPC shall promptly notify ENA in writing, and
 this Agreement shall automatically terminate upon the earlier of the date of
 ENA's receipt of such notice or the expiration of the Term, without any
 further liability of either Party to the other hereunder.  If, during the
 Term, ENA determines in good faith that it is unable to negotiate for the
 sale of the Turbine due to circumstances relating to the generator, it shall
 notify MPC and refund the Consideration; provided, however, that if ENA
 offers the Turbine for sale within 14 days of the termination in connection 
 with the foregoing, then MPC shall be entitled to an additional exclusivity 
 period of 10  business days to negotiate a definitive agreement in accordance 
 with the terms of this agreement. (or something like that)
