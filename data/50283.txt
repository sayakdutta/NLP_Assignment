 Vince,
 
 We had phone interview with Rabi De.  My impression is good. We should invite 
 him for a formal interview.
 
 He is a hands on person with wide range of experience ( energy financing, 
 derivatives trading, hedging, etc).
 He communicates very well and expressed interest in financial engineering & 
 modeling.
