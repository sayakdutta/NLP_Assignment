 I am forwarding this e mail to Janie Tholt.  Remember that they are busy with bid week and you may not get an answer on this issue from the Trader until next week.  I will be out of the office until 9/18 so please follow-up with the Trader.
 
 JANIE - when you have an opportunity please verify the price on deal 126428 for Client Services.
 
 
  
     
 Elizabeth, this is a sell to Southwest Gas for 11/99.  In reconciling their account, SWG paid this deal at El Paso Non Bondad GDP and we show the deal at El Paso Permian Basin GDP.  Can you check on this for me?  Thanks.
