 Monday morning should work.  Just give me a call.  I'm tied up in the p.m. but a.m. should work.

 I am in an off site vendor meeting this morning and hope to be in the office later this afternoon.  Unfortunately, I am out of town on Friday (I am actually headed to Austin for a visit).  But could perhaps do something Monday morning, if I can't get to the office in time this afternoon.  Let me know your availability.  Thanks so much.
