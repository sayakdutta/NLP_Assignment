 Please see Debra Thompson's note below regarding not setting up FAR orders for floor space billing. I also received a message from Billie Akhave stating EPSC will not be billing to FAR orders -- only company/cost centers.
 
 The last information I had was that all pipeline company employees' space should be billed to FAR orders. Has this changed?
 
 Thanks for your help.

 Maria - Please speak with Dave if you haven't already.  It will not be necessary for you to set these FAR orders up at this time.  I left a message with Tracy Geaccone to communicate this to Ruthann Frausto.

 Maria,  See the attached.  I believe you will set up the co. 0062 and 0085 FAR orders.
 
 Miriam, I believe you will set up the co. 1195 FAR orders but you need to check with Silvia first.  I think you will also set up the co. 0584 FAR orders but check with Barney first.
 
 Ruthann,
 Although there are people in the co. 0584 cost centers right now, they are in the process of being moved to other pipeline companies by 01/01/2002.  There will be no employees on co. 0584 after the first of the year.
 
 Thanks to all,
 Pat

 We have been instructed to begin charging all floor space and related charges to FAR orders for all pipeline employees. I was advised that the FAR orders to be used should be xxxx20009999, which is "G&A Custom Variant - Asset Not Specific".
 
 I've looked up all xxxx20009999 FAR orders in SAP and determined which cost centers for Houston employees need to have this FAR order set up. Attached is a spreadsheet showing the FAR orders which need to be created.
 
 Please call me if you need any additional information, and let me know when the FAR orders are created.
 
 Thanks for your help.
