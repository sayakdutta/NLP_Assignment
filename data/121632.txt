 
 Jan,
 
 Thanks for the email.  It is amazing what two days out of the office will do to my workload!!  I had two RFPs due yesterday - very busy!  I am going to work on our 'thoeoretical' deal that we discussed on Friday to see if there is anything there.  Hopefully, I can come up with something.  Thanks for the info on that.
 
 Call me any time you want to discuss power - I will be glad to share with you what I know.
 
 Thanks again for spending some time with us and hopefully we can come up with a good structure that is good for both of us!!
 
 Have a good day - 
 
 Kim
 
 
 
 

    
 
 
 
 
 Thank both of you for stopping by to visit last Friday.  It was good to see you.
 I hope Enron can get some of their "creative juices" going and figure out a way
 that the City of Mesa can compliment their gas contract with their electric
 needs.   I think there are some opportunities out there.
 
 Kim, two things.  One regarding capacity releasing:  our billing determinant is
 14,247 and we can release the difference of this number and what our load will
 be.  Sorry, I just had to think about it after the meeting.  Also, regarding
 this matter, one must consider the conditions of pre-arranged deals.  There are
 some hurdles, but all "doable" once we get our thinking caps on.
 
 Two, I did not realize that you were on the electric side for awhile.  I am in
 somewhat of a "learning mode" regarding electric and was wondering if you could
 just "jam" with me about the electric side.  I understand the concepts because
 of my position on the gas side, but I want to learn the players and some
 strategies.  Dave, I think you could teach me a thing or two also.
 
 Let me know.
