 Bingo!  Thank you!  Does 8:30 a.m. your time Wednesday work for a call?
 
  
     
 its a WP doc.   so detach and save first.  then open from the folder where 
 you saved it.  word will then convert it from wp to word and let you open 
 it.  if you have problems, let me know.

 getting these documents open?
