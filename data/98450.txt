 Attached is a?proposed agreement reflecting  Brazos limited waiver of its 
 right to object to V&E participating in the  Facilitation. Please review it 
 with your respective groups and get back to me  with any comments you may 
 have.
 ?
 Shortly, I will be sending you a first draft of  what I hope will be an 
 agreed-upon list of issues that need to be resolved in  order to effectively 
 address the damage question. 
 ?
 Tom, I don't know if Carl has had a chance to let  you know that Brazos would 
 like to change the date of the meeting of counsel to  either?November 9 or 
 10. Could you please find out if one of those dates  meets with your group's 
 approval? The meeting will be in Houston. 
 ?
 Pat, if you haven't already done so, you need to  send a copy of your memo on 
 damages to Tom.
