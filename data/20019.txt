 
 We are OUT of the pool.  I want my money back.  Prentice, please get your stuff out of my apartment.  You can have the cats.
 
 Love,
 Jeff
 
 Thanks for helping, Nancy. So what place are we in?
 
 
     
 
 As soon as I saw the problem (early Sunday morning), I left a Voice message
 on Jeff's phone, Prentice's phone and also a live message with the paging
 service for Jeff.  When it was time to determine what to do (i.e., the games
 were about to start),  I looked at the scores on Tennessee and Seattle and
 both were fairly high in the picks - Tenn ave. of 10.  so I figured that you
 must have meant to put 11 on one of your #12 teams.  I put the #12 on the
 team that alphabetically came first, put 11 on Tennessee, and lowered all
 remaining numbers to come back to 1.  (You did not have a 1 pick in what you
 sent.)  I honestly did what I thought you were trying to do, so I'm sorry if
 it wasn't the right thing.
 
 Donna had come over to watch the game, so I couldn't really talk when you
 called the last time and even though you were trying to give me what you
 meant, the Seattle game was already over, so I don't think it would have
 been fair to change it at that point.  
 
 Did you have a marvelous time???  Did they like the tomatoes?
