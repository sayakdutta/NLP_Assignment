 
 I just heard from Tenley that you and Steve have been in a pretty bad car 
 wreck and are hospitalized in Florida.  My thoughts and prayers are with both 
 of you.  She said you were checking your emails so I just wanted to get a 
 note in to you, and when you feel better maybe we could have a little chat.
 
 I miss you!
