 I glanced at the presentation.  It looks good.  
 Two comments:
 1.  Could we use our older machines for home use?  They are still very good 
 they just aren't the newest technology.  All are fast, CD ready  with plenty 
 of memory.  It could knock the cost down significantly.
 2.  I would have the cost of Houston only to start with as a pilot.  That 
 would reduce our initial costs significantly even for NA.  I recommend that 
 you at least know what that cost is as a fall back position.
 
 Good luck.  Your teams hard work really shows here.
