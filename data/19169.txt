 
 Steve:  Here are the deals and offers.  The desk is concerned about two 
 things:
 
 1) that we not make the specific of the deals/offers public.  They're fine 
 with general statements like "the offers are below the price cap."
 
 2) they have good relationships with the IOUs and the munis and are starting 
 to do a lot of deal; as such, they expressed concern about any comments that 
 might agitate them and make them disinclined to transact with us (sound 
 familiar)?
 
 If there's anything else you need, for if you have any questions about this 
 material.  Don't hesitate.
 
 Good luck.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
