 
 i never see sammy.  i ran into him on a thursday night about 2 months ago, 
 but i have not seen him since.  the girl situation is good.  i have just been 
 dating this girl from texas a&m, but she is not a die hard a&m freak so it is 
 cool.  do you hang out with bert?  i can't believe he is getting married.  
 talk to you soon.
