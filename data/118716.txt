 
 Here is the revised list - there are several European entities that we showed 
 in our database so I have highlightedd them as well.  There were also several 
 from Friday's list that were still there so I have also bolded those.  I'll 
 try to track down what happened with those entities (Cinergy, DPL, NJ Nat 
 Gas, Niagara Mohawk & Washington Gas Light).
