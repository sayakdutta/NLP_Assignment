 Mark,
 
 I have revised the financial swap term sheets that you reviewed several weeks 
 ago. Could you have a look at these new versions and see if they meet your 
 approval? They are for the Originators to use as a basis for their 
 discussions with potential counterparties and are not meant to be binding 
 documents. Thank you.
