 Going forward, I would appreciate your informing me of any change affecting 
 the slates of the Directors and Officers of ETS entities.  As the liaison 
 between this office and the Corporate Services office, I'm frequently 
 questioned about these changes.  Thanks in advance for your cooperation.
 
 Bill
