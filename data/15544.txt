 
 Joe, meet Joe.  My apologies.  I've had trouble getting contact information 
 for Joe (Kaishkill).  Joe  K. could you confirm that you've received this 
 note.  Also, I left you Joe A.'s phone contact numbers on your Houston 
 voicemail last week.  Joe A. could you please send Joe K. your contact 
 numbers again?  Thanks very much.  
 
 If there's anything else either of you need, please don't hesitate to let me 
 know.
 
 All the best,
 Jeff

 Hello Jeff:
 
 I am back from my Asia trip and will be leaving for Brazil tomorrow. I would 
 like to contact Joe Kaischkill in anticipation of my trip to schedule time 
 with him. Could I get a contact # or email to intitiate contact?
 
 Thanks for your help once again.
 Best regards,
 Joe Alcantara
