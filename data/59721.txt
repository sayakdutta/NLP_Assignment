      Tammie-
      
      Can you kindly confirm details of where, when, # of sessions if 
      greater than one, for this presentation.  I understand you are the 
      person Louise had designated to help us coordinate the 
      presentation/training.  It will be a powerpoint presentation that we 
      need your assistance ensuring can be projected as well ensuring the 
      traders/business have adequate number of copies of hand out material.
      
      Attached is the presentation.  Hand outs that we require your 
      assistance in handling is:
      
      - Presentation print out
      
      - Mercy Gil to supply you with a printed list of contact names phone 
      and cell phones by end of day today
      
      - Wendy Bannerman Clarke to supply the Day 1 Policy (even if still a 
      draft) as well as the Discipline and Sanction policy by end of day 
      today.  
      
      Tammie - If you can get all the hand outs in 1 pack that would be 
      great but it is not required.
      
      Please speak with Debbie Brackett if you have any questions, issues, 
      etc and we thank you very much in advance for your assistance.
      
      Looking forward to meeting you,
      Lisa Feld
