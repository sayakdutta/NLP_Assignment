 
 I am fine with mine.
 
 Thanks.
 
 



   
 Ok, I'm supposed to be getting more XLs today.  If you don't want to trade 
 your T-shirt for an XL, please let me know, otherwise leave your T-shirt in 
 your chair in case you're not there when I come by.  I'll switch them when I 
 get the XLs from our team lead.
 
 Thanks,
 Allison
