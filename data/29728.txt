 I just spoke to Mike Banks at Milbank who said payment has not yet been
 received re: their invoice.  He has had some conversations with Robert
 Novak and others at Enron and undertands that payment has been approved
 but for some reason not yet made.  I would appreciate if you could look
 into this to see what the status is.
 
 Mike understands that we are in a holding pattern on the permanent
 financing until the changes in the project are completed.

 Bill
