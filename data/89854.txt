 
 As a follow-up to our meeting on Saturday, I talked with the designer of my house (Todd Rice with Rice Residential Design) and the electrical plan is not on a CAD system.   The electrical plan was hand drawn.
 
 If you need a copy of the plan, my preference is that you deal directly with Todd and his staff as I am very busy during the week.
