 
 I am preparing an assignment of two physical gas trades that were incorrectly 
 done online with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and ENA and assigning 
 them to CIBC World Markets plc and ECC (ECC has a physical master with this 
 counterparty, ENA doesn't).  I am adding a statement to the effect that these 
 Transactions shall constitute "Transactions" under the ECC Master Agreement 
 and want to confirm that "Transactions" is defined as such under your Master 
 Agreement.  Can you confirm that for me.  Much thanks!
 
 Too bad you won't be here for the party.  It's always a good one.  Also, 
 Sunday is Astroworld day for Enron employees, but you probably won't get here 
 early enough to do that either...
