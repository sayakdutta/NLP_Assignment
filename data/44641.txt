 
 I printed out the referenced list that you sent me, but it has some 
 information on it that I don't think we necessarily want to show the NYMEX.  
 Specifically, your last two columns that show "cmbTaxType" and "tg/Active".  
 Is there any way you can reprint the list only showing the name of the 
 corporation and the place of incorporation?  Thanks.
