 Debra--
 
 My only response to this contract is that Duke should only be given $1MM for their credit threshold (and not $10MM).  Again, the ISDA contract that we already have executed is eating up all of their line.  They should not complain about this, as the executed Master Physical with ECC gives them a $1MM threshold.
 
 Let me know if you have any questions.  I remember going through this once before with them.  Just have them call me about their threshold if they're disputing it.
 
 Thanks--Veronica
 
  
     
  
  This is the redline version.  Veronica please review the change to days and language in section 11 (b).  They are ready to sign, please get back to me asap.
