 
 hey....just an fyi, we talked last night...conversation took less than 5 mins and i think somehow whatever i needed to hear was said, or not said if that makes any sense.  anyway, i'm definitely up for a drink tonight as well as shutting this door behind me and keeping an eye open for the next one ahead.
 
 .....the guy actually said that he was "bummed"....that choice of words did wonders for me....i mean, you get bummed they don't make your favorite candy bar anymore or b/c you had a disappointing meal....it's just not enough that someone be "bummed" by the prospect of never being with me again.
 
 talk to you later,
