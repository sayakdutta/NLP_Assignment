 I am preparing the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act filing for Enron Corp. in connection 
 with the sale of the MTBE/Isomerization facility to EOTT Energy Partners, 
 L.P.  I believe that the filing should be made by this Friday, May 25 in 
 order to be sure that the 30 day waiting period will expire before the 
 anticipated closing date of June 29.  Please read the attached memo which 
 requests that each of you look through your files to determine whether or not 
 you possess the types of documents described in the memo.  I would be happy 
 to discuss any questions that you may have regarding whether or not 
 particular documents in your files would be responsive to this request.  
 Since Enron needs to make this filing by Friday, it is important that you 
 respond to the memo by Thursday, May 24.
