 Dear All
 
 This is just a quick note to let you know that I will be leaving Enron next 
 Friday to return to New Zealand in order to enjoy an extra summer and to 
 study a bit more law.
 
 I'll be around until Friday 6th August should you have anything specific you 
 would like me to deal with, but Michael Slade will now be dealing with all of 
 my files. Michael has joined us from Covington & Burling and can be contacted 

 
 Thanks to all of you for your assistance and advice over the past few years, 
 it has been a pleasure working with you.
 
 Kindest regards,
 Sasha
