 Susan, I promise this will be the last time we go through this.  Attached is 
 the draft letter.  I have added the words for the discount paragraph "for the 
 term of the contract" as you requested.  Please provide the additional 
 language for the paragragh regarding our retaining  revenues of capacity 
 release above the discount level being subject to FERC approval, otherwise if 
 not accepted by the FERC then not applicable. Thanks!
