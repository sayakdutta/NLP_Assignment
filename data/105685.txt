 new Enron Credit Inc. account.  The portfolio includes high-risk, high yield 
 instruments.  We should contact the brokers today or tomorrow for the form of 
 agreements.  Why don't you ask Stephanie or Sam to prepare three sets of 
 assignments?  They should coordinate with Sheila to identify the attachment.

 Sara and Cheryl,
 This related to the CREDIT Book only.

 Cheryl:
 
 Enron Credit Inc. , a  Delaware corporation, has been created for U.S. debt 
 trading currently handled by ENA.   As a result, ENA will need to transfer 
 its brokerage debt positions to Enron Credit Inc. accounts with those 
 brokers.  The brokers include our favorites:
 
 Bear Stearns Companies
 Morgan Stanley & Co. Inc.
 Goldman Sachs & Co. 
 
 ENA will need to assign its positions by the end of February, 2001.
 Richard Sage (London office) will need to see the "sample package" (unanimous 
 consent, authorized trader list).  Will you please see that an email is sent 
 to Richard with this information?
 
 We should begin the documentation now.  Let me know if you have any questions.
