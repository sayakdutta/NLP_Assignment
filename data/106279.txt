 I have attached the KPM Lasara draft which we had done before, the current 
 James Hardie Draft, the Deal Ticket for the current James Hardie Draft and 
 the James Hardie Term Sheet. I need to know how to phrase the Automatic 
 Termination Provision language for the purchase of the mill. Please give me a 
 call if you have any questions (ext. 35700).
 
 Thank you,
 Jarrod
