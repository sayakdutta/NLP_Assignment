 
 Here's what I need (thanks, honey):
 
 3 bags of fresh cranberries
 2 oranges
 box of brown sugar
 6 jars of oysters
 6 loaves of bread (get the "rounds" of bread---vary them, like olive bread, 
 sour dough, sweet, whole grain, potato)
 thing of celery
 4 large yellow onions
 couple bulbs of garlic
 2 pounds of butter (clover, salted)
 
 Thanks, sweetie, and good luck on your midterm!
