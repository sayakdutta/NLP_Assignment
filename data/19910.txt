 
 Greetings TJ:
 
 Hope all is well with you and yours.  Two quick questions:
 
 1) When can we expect to get our grades?  I have a tuition reimbursement "issue" and would like to get the grades ASAP.  Any idea?  Much appreciated.
 
 2) Where do I go and how do I get there to uncover what classes I ended up getting in the bidding process.
 
 Thanks for everything and have a great holiday.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
