 big car--lincoln town or something.

 First, Eldon, I just want to tell you how psyched I am for New Year's. 
 Thanks so much for arranging it. We'll have a great time--and Cameron and I 
 have already ironed out a nice deal concerning eyeing the Playmates. (I 
 suggest you do the same, Jeff, or are you above gawking at plastic tits?) 
 Cameron says: I can stare at whoever I want! Not bad, eh?
 
 Jeff and I have our fig leaves all picked out...
 
 As far as fetching you at LAX... Because Cameron and I (and PP and Jeff?) 
 are going down on the 30th, we should rent a car then. When Eldon and Nancy 
 come in, we'll already have a car, and so we can just collect you and go 
 right to the hotel. Does that sound okay? That way, you guys won't have to 
 rent a car when you get in. (I'll put Eldon on as a driver so that he can 
 take over behind the wheel, if he wants to do that.) What kind of car should 
 I get? Do we drive to the mansion? Now that I think about it, that would 
 mean we need to squeeze 6 in one car. Anyway, let me know what your thought 
 are on this.
 
 Have a great time with the Hopkins. Merry Christmas to PP and Jeff. I'll see 
 the rest of you on the beach!
