 - ALBERTADIR is in the table: Peak = (20,162), Off-peak = (20,588)
 
 - Per your last email, I'll remove RETAILEAST and RETAILWEST.
 
 - For spreadsheets, we currently see the following:
 POWER-SS-R3B-PRC
 POWER-SS-R3C-PRC
 POWER-SS-R1B-PRC
 We'll take these from RiskTrac.
 
 - For SouthAmerica positions, we can also take from RiskTrac
 
 - The numbers for EAST and WEST are off because I ran the query at around 11AM. I didn't realize that Adhoc only holds the last calculated numbers, not as of a certain effective date. If we run the query everyday at 7AM, can we be sure we're capturing all of previous day's trading? And none of current day's?
 
 Thanks.
 -Tom
  
     
 I was incorrect about Alberta ENA, it should be zero but where is Alberta?  It should have a big position.

 Hi Stacey.
 
 We've generated the numbers below directly from EnPower/Adhoc (effective date 10/24). Just a couple of points I need to confirm before we can try to generate our DPR numbers from this query --
 
 1) where can we get the spreadsheet positions from?
 2) are these all the Enpower portfolios we should be picking up for Power?
 3) do the numbers for NA look correct? 
 4) I will be sending the numbers daily to the "contacts" listed -- any other names I should add?
 
 Thanks.
 - Tom
