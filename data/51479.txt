 
 Tony,
 
 Happy New Year and Congratulations. I hope you feel better soon.  Let's meet 
 for lunch when you get back
 to the office.

 Vince,
 Thanks for the information. You predicted this would happen. Where is he 
 headed?
 I have been ill since the new year. I did not work yesterday and  I am here 
 today till only about 1:30 p.m. Some have said it is not a good way to start 
 the millennium but I think I was only getting rid of the bad stuff from the 
 past!
 
 I wanted to let you know myself (I am sure however, that you know already 
 from "BBC") that I have been promoted as vice president of  Knowledge 
 Management at Azurix. I really need to see you sometime soon and  I shall 
 call your assistant and for time on your calendar. 
 See you soon.
 Tony.
