 cried for not going now.  Is she still married, because if not I want to 
 propose.  
 
 Cabo was pretty sweet.  Plenty of sun, sand, and women.  Hooked up with a 
 chick from Seattle for most of the week and had a great time.  We went 
 fishing one day and caught a 100 lb. swordfish.  Took a portion of it to a 
 restaurant and they cooked it for us.  Awesome.  There were tons of Honeymoon 
 couples down there.  You might want to check it out.  It is a short flight 
 and pretty reasonably priced.  They have some great hotels as well.
 
 I will be coming in for the Houston game weekend after next, so have my room 
 ready.  Talk at ya later.
