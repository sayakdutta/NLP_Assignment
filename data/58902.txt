 
 See below.  These numbers were gathered in the first week of August (during the time that the hypocrisy of Davis' power company bashing was revealed in the conflict of interest scandal).  The reality of his failed approach may finally be catching up with him.
 
  
     
 
 
  
     
 here are the CA numbers from a survey conducted the first week in
 August by Voter/Consumer Research, run by Jan Von Louhausen, the
 pollster for President Bush:
 
 Gray Davis
 
 FAV             48
 UNFAV	       44
 
 STRONG UNFAV     28
 STRONG FAV          15
 
 
 RIGHT TRACK         34
 WRONG TRACK      49
 
 
 DAVIS  		40
 RIORDAN          39
 
 
 
 
 Note that the strong fav/unfav is a 1:1.8, which is one of the worst
 numbers I have ever seen for an incumbent Governor in 20 years.  The
 fav/unfav is an anemic 1:1.  The right track/wrong track is
 devastating, and the gubernatorial ballot is tied.  These numbers
 have changed dramatically and put Davis in a very precarious
 situation politically.
