 I don't know if you can answer any of this but it seems like we're just hanging in the wind while someone ought to be able to give us answers: 
 
 1. Do we have any vacation that we can take...if i wanted to take off this Fri for instance?
 
 2. What's the deal with the day after Chrismas (assuming we're still around)?
