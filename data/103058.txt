 Thank you Dave for the horribly long hours you put in on this.
  
  
 
 
     
 
 All,
  
 The systems affected by the server failure have been restored.
  
 You Must Log Off And Log Back On To Pick Up The Drives That Were Dropped.
  
 We are very sorry about the the significant inconvenience that this has caused all of you.
  
 If you have any questions, please contact me at x3701.
  
 Regards

 Last night our main 'Server' failed, and we have been working since to restore service.
  
 It looks like we lost NO data
  
 For the time, you cannot get to your H:, P:, W:, R: (Local Drives)
  
 I have no ETA.
  
 You will have trouble starting some programs.
  
 Terminal Server is UNAFFECTED:
  
 Houston Based Data is UNAFFECTED:
  
 I will follow up with more news / details later
  
 Victor and Paul are available to help get you with anything we can.
  
 Thank you for your patience
