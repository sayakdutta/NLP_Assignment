 
 Hi Gaye,
 
 We are looking forward to seeing you and Earl this weekend.  We will have 9 
 for dinner, not counting the 6 year old who will have eaten (although he will 
 eat a piece of bread, if offered).  I just hate to pay for a real dinner for 
 him when I know he won't be interested in grown up food.
 
 If it isn't too much trouble, could you email me the menu?
 
 We will be bringing beer and wine.
 
 See you soon (just not soon enough),
