 
 Except it can't be negative because they were grants at no cost to me.   The problem is the combination of restricted stock which is total market value and options which is gain/loss need to be added together to get total portfolio value.
 
 I was hoping you could trick the system so portfolio value was accurate.
 
  
     
 Mr. Presto,
 That is true, I was wondering if we shouldn't just figure that the
 Gain/Loss(Difference between the current market value and the cost basis)
 represents the actual value of the stock option portfolio. Does that make
 sense?
 
 Thanks,
 Hank Emery
 
 
     
 
 The options are not valued properly.   The market value is calculated
 based upon the value of the underlying, which grossly overstates the
 market value of the portfolio.  The restricted stock (basis of $0) is
 valued OK, but the options are not.
 
 In addition, the year restricted stock and option grant is not yet in
 the portfolio.
