 
 my old carrier went out of biz this week, convenient huh?  so i do not have service as of 2 days ago.
 
  
     
 I need a copy of an old bill to cancel service at your current location and I have our IT group using their connections to try and have your DSL installed quickly at your new location.  Will let you know a date as soon as I get an answer.
