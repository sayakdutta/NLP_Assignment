 I just saw your email address on the Monmouth web site.  I didn't realized 
 you were at Mayer Brown.  I don't even know if we've talked since I left New 
 York (almost 5 years ago).  I'm now in the legal department at Enron Capital 
 & Trade Resources in Houston where my group is responsible for the legal 
 issues in derivatives trading here.  I don't get to Chicago often but if they 
 ever send you down this way, be sure to look me up!
 
 C., F. & S.,
 
 Mark
