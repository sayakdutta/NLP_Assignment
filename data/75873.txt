 No reason other than I don't really care to go.
 
 I really would like to do the FtW Show. Would weekends work best for you? I
 checked TicketMaster and all the weekend shows are available, even the "sold
 out" shows. I didn't check the price. They do have some weekday shows also
 if you would rather do that.

 You know me.  I don't care one way or the other.  Is there a reason why you
 want to skip it?
 
 We don't have to go to FW for the rodeo.  I just thought that would be fun
 to do, and my mom wants Michael to come so badly.  We can always just go
 for a visit.  In fact, Michael and I can go alone some time.
 
 Like I said last night, you would make a great guide.  You'll be Michael's
 guide one of these days.
