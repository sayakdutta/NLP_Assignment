 I can't do it that week. I'm on travel black out because my wife is going 
 away for the week and I have the home duty (first time she's ever done this 
 in 6 years so I probably need to let her go - as if I had any say!).
 
 How about something the following week?

 Hi Ben,
 
 How's about the Acccounting/Finance presentation at noon on May 23rd, then we 
 can all go to the Astros' game at 305?
