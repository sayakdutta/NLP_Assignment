 Ed,
 
 Please talk to Tana Jones and see if she can get the ball rolling to finalize 
 the assignment amendment that is on Carol St.Clair's desk.  Basically, I 
 spoke with Vangie last week, and we agreed to make the effective date of the 
 assignment JUNE 12, 2000.  That's the last issue at hand.  Please have Tana 
 (or other legal person) insert the date, get it executed accordingly, and fax 
 a copy of the signature back to Vangie at Merchant.  Vangie's number is 
 410-295-1719.  Please ask for her fax number if you don't have it or can't 
 find it.  [ this assignment is what Christopher Smith worked on with 
 Vangie...it pertains to gas and financial trades ]
 
 FYI, last week Vangie forwarded to me the second assignment batch pertaining 
 to power deals.  I'll look at this.
 
 Thanks,
 Tracy

 Tana:
 This should be pretty straight forward.  The only remaining issue was they 
 needed to put in an effective date for the assignment amendment that they 
 wanted us to sign.  The papers should be in my office.  Call me at home if 
 you have any problems.

 Tana,
 
 Before Carol St. Clair left for maternity leave, she was working on the 
 assignment of some financial and gas deals with Christopher Smith (who 
 previously worked in our group).  Since Christopher is no longer here and 
 with Carol being out, I'm scrambling to find out who in the financial team is 
 working on this.
 
 I've left Mark Taylor a message since Carol's voice mail forwards all 
 questions to Mark.
 
 Could you let me know if you have any info?
 
 Thx,
 Tracyh
