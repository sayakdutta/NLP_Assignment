 Thanks.  After reviewing these agreements, we would like to see the 
 Acquisition Agreement whereby the Partnership acquires its interest in the 
 Trust.  Alos, we would like to confirm with Henry that after giving effect to 
 all of the transactions that are described in the Master Agreement that the 
 Partnership's only asset will be its interest in the Trust and the 
 distributions that are made with respect to such interest.  Is that correct?  
 Does the Partnership have any other source of csah flow?
