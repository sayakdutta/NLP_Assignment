 Sara -
 SMUD gave us their version of the ISDA agreement about 6 weeks ago and I am 
 still waiting for comments.  I believe Susan Flynn is working on it and I 
 thought we would get comments by this past Monday.  They want to start doing 
 financial gas and power swaps and I would really like to wrap up the legal 
 contract side of things.  Can someone please call or email me and tell me the 
 status.
 
 Thank you (503-464-3810)
