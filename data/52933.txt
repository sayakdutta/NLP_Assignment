 There were these two elderly people living in a  Florida 
 mobile home park. He was a widower and she a widow. 
 They had known  one another for a number of years. 
 
 Now, one evening there was a community  supper in the big 
 activity center. These two were at the same table, across  
 from one another. As the meal went on, he made a few admiring 
 glances at  her and finally gathered up his courage to ask her, 
 "Will you marry  me?" 
 
 After about six seconds of 'careful consideration,' she answered. 
 "Yes. Yes, I will." 
 
 The meal ended and with a few more pleasant exchanges, they 
 went to their respective places. 
 
 Next  morning, he was troubled. "Did she say 'yes' or did she 
 say 'no'?" He  couldn't remember. Try as he would, he just 
 could not recall.    Not even a faint memory. 
 
 With trepidation, he went to the telephone and called  her. 
 First, he explained to her that he didn't remember as well as 
 he used  to. Then he reviewed the lovely evening past.     As 
 he gained a little more  courage, he then enquired of her, "When 
 I asked if you would marry me, did  you say 'Yes' or did you 
 say 'No'?" 
 
 He was delighted to hear her say,  "Why, I said, 'Yes, yes I will' 
 and I meant it with all my heart." Then she  continued, "And I 
 am so glad that you called, because I couldn't remember  who had 
 asked me."
