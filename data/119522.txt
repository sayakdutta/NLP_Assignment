 
 My husband and his friends want me to inquire more about your fishing lodge 
 and prices.  A bunch of them turn 50 next year and are thinking of going on a 
 fishing trip.  Can you give me any more information on prices and 
 availiablity for next year.  Please advise what is included in the price and 
 where we  need to fly into.  If you have any brochures, canyou send them to 
 me at Jane Tholt, 7502 Highland Farms Rd., Houston, TX 77095  .  Hope you 
 have a great day and it was great seeing you.
