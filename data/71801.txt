 Hi Tana,
 
 A little birdie tells me that you  have a supply of the Energy & Power Risk 
 Management Glossary booklets.  Am I getting close? I've found it to be very 
 helpful, and I think it would help one of our new lawyers, Carlos Sole.  
 Could I get a copy for him?  Any other good power references?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
