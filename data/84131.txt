 Here are the changes to the Enfolio that Michael and I came up with.  Please
 review and let me know if you have any comments.
 I spoke with Michael and the document that Reed of PGT mentioned was with
 Michael is actually the surety bond that Michael has sent to the insurance
 company for final execution.  If you have any credit questions, please call
 Michael at 650-303-0274 (cell).
