 We had discussed having two change orders so that the ESA stuff is easily 
 identifiable/assignable/etc.  Is this still the plan?

 In addition, the dual fuel cost will be split between ESA and ENA ($280,000 
 to ENA and $280,000 to ESA).

 Kathy and Kay,
 
 I have revised change order #2 to account for the additional scope added by 
 ESA.  Please review  and comment.  I did not change the effective date.
 
 For information purposes, all but item "b" are attributed to ESA.
 
 Regards,
 
 Chris
