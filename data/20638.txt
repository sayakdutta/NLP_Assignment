 
 Sounds good.  How about first thing tomorrow morning for a call?
 
  
     
 I have been instructed by Chris C that we need to go to DWR, PG&E the state or whom ever will listen.  I will start working on the all-in (PG&E/SCE) presentation!
 
 When are you both available for a conference call.
 
  
     
 Called Fielder to confirm and he said that he needed to cancel.  As you know, the Legislature closed without doing anything with Edison's bailout legislation.  The Governor has said that the will order them back into session in two weeks.  That has Fielder and everyone else at Edison scrambling to continue their attempts to stay out of bankruptcy, which means that Fielder won't be focused, and can't focus on, anything else for the next couple of weeks. Let's regroup.  Dave, perhaps we should just go ahead and start with PG&E. Thoughts?
 
 Best,
 Jeff
