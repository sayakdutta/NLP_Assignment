 On an ISDA I am reviewing, credit has asked that all indebtedness of the 
 Canadian counterparty to its affiliates be subordinated to us (in this case 
 ECC).  Does anyone have access to a Canadian form of subordination 
 agreement?  I imagine that a fairly bare-bones form would suffice.  Thanks --
