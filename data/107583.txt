 
 Thanks for your interest.  Of course I remember our conversation.  By now I'm 
 sure you know you are on our interview list.  (If I told you prematurely, use 
 it to your advantage somehow with your friends.)  I've contacted one of our 
 head broadband marketers to set up an introduction, and see where this goes.  
 It's a great idea, and you should hear back from me shortly, when David 
 responds to me call.  
 
 Best regards,
 
 Jeff
 
 P.S.  Please call me Jeff--I'm not some grey haired old dude, but I 
 appreciated your being professional in your first email to me.
 
 
 
 

    
 
 
 Dear Mr. Shankman,
 ? How are you doing? We met last week at the  undergraduate Enron 
 presentation and discussed the possibility of an Enron/ESPN  deal that would 
 enable television viewers to order old sporting events over the  television 
 (similar to the Blockbuster deal). You told me to send you an email  around 
 this time to follow up, so I can find out who to contact to get the ball  
 rolling. Thanks again for taking the time to listen to my idea.
 ?
 Sincerely,
 Zachary Costello
