 
 Tiny,
 
 Thank you so much for the reminder, sometimes I think my brain has slipped away.  Do you need all of the San Juan and West of Thoreau contracts?  If you know you have some of them, which ones do you have, I'll send you the rest.
 
 My apologies,
 
 Kim.
 
  
     
 Kim, last year you provided me with a name/contact in your group that could help me obtain Operating Agreements for customers/interconnects in our area which we curretnly do not have on file.  Unfortunately, I procrastinated with all the happenings towards the end of the year and lost the name..  Could you please send me the name so that I can proceed with the plans of setting up a Regional master file with those agreements.. Thanks
