 
 Hi, Robbi!
 
 Hope you are enjoying your time off.  I know I certainly enjoyed Friday and Tuesday and hated to come back today.
 
 Anne and I went to the Decorative Center yesterday, and tried to check out some samples at Beacon Hill (Robert Allen Fabrics) and they couldn't find your account.  Do you have an account there, or was I mistaken?
 
 Anyway, I thought I'd e-mail you since I don't have your home number in case you were going to the Decorative Center later this week to see if you could check out some samples for us if you had time.

 If you don't go back to DC or have already gone, we can maybe find the Robert Allen samples at Expo. They sell his fabrics there.
 
 Thanks!  We really appreciate your help.
