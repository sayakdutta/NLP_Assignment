 REASONS FOR USING OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)
 
 1. Once your mailbox has been migrated from Notes to Outlook, the Outlook c=
 lient will be configured on your computer.
 After migration of your mailbox, you will not be able to send or recieve ma=
 il via Notes, and you will not be able to start using Outlook until it is c=
 onfigured by the Outlook Migration team the morning after your mailbox is m=
 igrated.  During this period, you can use Outlook Web Access (OWA) via your=
  web browser (Internet Explorer 5.0) to read and send mail.
 
 PLEASE NOTE:  Your calendar entries, personal address book, journals, and T=
 o-Do entries imported from Notes will not be available until the Outlook cl=
 ient is configured on your desktop.
 
 2. Remote access to your mailbox.
 After your Outlook client is configured, you can use Outlook Web Access (OW=
 A) for remote access to your mailbox.
 
 PLEASE NOTE:  At this time, the OWA client is only accessible while connect=
 ing to the Enron network (LAN).  There are future plans to make OWA availab=
 le from your home or when traveling abroad.
 
 HOW TO ACCESS OUTLOOK WEB ACCESS (OWA)
 
 Launch Internet Explorer 5.0, and in the address window type:  http://nahou=
 -msowa01p/exchange/john.doe

  will be prompted with a sign in box as shown below.  Type in "corp/your us=
 er id" for the user name and your NT password to logon to OWA and click OK.=
   You will now be able to view your mailbox.
