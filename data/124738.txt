 That's right,
 I forgot about QOTSA.  Did you enjoy that CD? 
 Your dad is coming in today to see the trading floor and then we are going to grab some lunch and talk about what we do here at the big E. I fly out at 4 on Friday afternoon...
 
 I guess Nikki is coming to Portland at the end of October...oh-oh.

 Allright. Let me know when I can meet you. At least I can give you back your
 "Queens of the Stone Age" CD.

 B-
 I will only be in Albuquerque for like 4 hours Monday morning...so it
 doesn't look like I will have to much of a chance to meet up with you.
 Maybe an early afternoon brew...
 Emily Willis--huh--didn't you and her...oh yeah...I remember the flat
 tire.
 
 
     
 
 Dude,
 
 I was looking around on "classmates.com" and found out that Ryan Leppert
 married Emily Willis.  Remember Emily Willis? We got a flat tire in the
 pouring down rain coming home from her house one night?
