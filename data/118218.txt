 Paul,
 
 the counterparty to the Put is not ECT Europe Inc. but Enron Capital & Trade 
 Resources Corp. This means any opinion about due incorporation and execution 
 comes from Mark Haedicke and the opinion should therefore be included in Mark 
 Taylor's bundle of docs for Mark or one of his team to present to Mark 
 Haedicke.
 
 Thanks.
 
 
      Mark

 Mark, you will note we actually asked for the debt Put Company to be changed 
 to ECTR Corp. a couple of weeks ago.

 Can anybody tell me where this company fits in to the Enron group structure? 
 Who are its shareholders and when was it incorporated. Is it definitely a 
 Delaware Corp?
 
 Can you please let me know asap.
 
 Thanks
