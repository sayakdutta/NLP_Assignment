 I am supposed to talk to her tonight.  What do you think it is?
     
                Subject:
 
    i think something's wrong with mom...she's totally down in the dumps
    (i've
    called for the last few days now, and every time she seems depressed)
 
    maybe you should give her a casual call, just to say hi and see what's
    up
    (but don't make it a big deal, or else she'll pretend she's happy and
    everything's okay)

    PS:  i went to pottery barn kids the other day....super cute!  how's
    your
    nursery coming along?
