 Jeff,
 
 I apologize, because I realise that I had not introduced myself to you.  I 
 work with John Ambler as Director for International Marketing and Public 
 Relations.  The original release was drafted by Envera and since our PR 
 department provides support for the Crude and Liquids Product group, as part 
 of our PR responsibilities for EGM, it was sent to us to revise and run 
 through the approval process.  The copy I sent to you is the revised version 
 that we completed.  We now will send it through the Corp. PR approval 
 process, which includes a review by Investor Relations.
 
 Again, thank you for your kind cooperation.
 Habiba
 
 
    
  
 Have our PR people seen this?

 Thank you for your response.  Attached is the revised draft, please let me 
 know if it meets with your approval.
 
 
 
 
    
  
 I'd like to leave out mention of our equity participation in the first and 
 third paragraphs, and reword the second paragraph to state that envera's 
 customers will have access to enron's products.  (leave out the qualifier 
 "many"  which I read as "partial")

 Attached for your review and approval is the press release that Envera wishes 
 to issue immediately announcing the participation of Enron Global Markets as 
 an equity partner and trading member.  We already have sent it to John Nowlan 
 and John Viverito and secured their approval.  Please let me know your 
 comments. 
 
 Thank you.
