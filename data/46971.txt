 
 The Firm ID and Password would have been sent to Mark Haedicke.  He doesn't 
 recall ever receiving it.  I have to contact ISDA on Mark Haedicke's behalf 
 to locate the password.

 Tana, thanks for the help you extended Karen Cordova, Marianne Castano and me 
 on our recent ISDA quest.
 
 We received a copy of a letter telling us we should contact the Primary ISDA 
 contact within our firm for the Firm ID and Password assigned to our 
 organization.  Marianne Castano asked that I get it from you or find out who 
 I should call.
 
 Thanks for your help.
