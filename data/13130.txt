 Thanks, Sharon.  The GIS version just adds a view words from the employment 
 application alerting employees not to 'overstate' their education, skills, 
 experience, etc.

 Dear Sherry:  I provided the SAP version which is similar to the one on the 
 Corporate LAN.  I will have Mark Holsworth and Kriste Sullivan provide their 
 comments.  Thanks.   Sharon

 We are working on a single logon process through HR On-Line that will enable 
 employees to utilize functionality in SAP Employee Self Service and HR-GIS 
 without having to be concerned about which system to use.  I am attaching the 
 security warning messages from both systems for your review.  Andrea and I 
 believe it would be best to combine these statements and would appreciate 
 your assistance in doing so.  Michelle, as you will recall, you helped us 
 with the statement for HR-GIS.  I do not know who provided the SAP version, 
 but it seems more similar to the general one on the Corporate LAN.
 
 Please let me know if one of you can assist us with this.  We are under a 
 pretty tight time crunch with July 1 looming fairly closely.  Thank you for 
 your consideration and help!
