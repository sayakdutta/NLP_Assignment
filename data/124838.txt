 Sunil,
 Per our conversation on the phone. We are getting several requests from customers to allow them to "personalize" their quotes to only include hourly EOL products. We are currently trading physical firm power at NP-15, SP-15, PV, and Mid-C for hours ending 12-20. A same day filter or hourly product filter would work nicely.
 Please let me know what you might need from me to get this accomplished as quickly as possible.
 Thanks,
 
 Bill Williams
