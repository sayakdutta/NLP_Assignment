 It looks like Tana has been corresponding with these guys about EOL trading.  
 Modesto was planning to address the ISDA after working with Tana on the 
 electronic trading agreement.  By copy of this message, Tana should let you 
 know if anything recent has happened on the ISDA front. 
 
 Let me know if you need anything further. 
 
 Regards.  SS
