 Glad to hear all is well. I meant to comment that I thought the people profiled in the article should pull their heads out of their self important asses. It isn't about finding the meaning of life at work. It is all about the $$$. Work hard. Make $$$. Retire young. Things with me are great. Moving back to Calgary in about a month which is a little sooner than I thought I would be going back but when opportunity knocks you gotta go. Take care. 
 
  
     
 I don't hear from you in months and then you level me with such a thought
 provoking, soul searching article.  Thanks for thinking of me to send it to.
   I really enjoyed reading it.  We certainly fit into certain parts of the
 article.  There are a few life theories like that which working through.
 Its all interesting stuff.
 
 How are things going with you?  Are you enjoying Houston?
 
 London has been great.  Brokering over here has been pretty rewarding.
 Traders over here seem to have a lot more respect for other humans.
 Catriona is well and has landed herself a pretty cool job in PR.
 
 Keep in touch,
 
 Mike
