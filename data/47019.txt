 to transact between the two companies without adverse tax consequences.  We 
 have no such agreement in place with ECTRIC, and the UK tax regime is 
 different.  We cannot transact between ENA & ECTRIC under each others masters.

 Per my voicemail, 
 
 My first thought would be that the Credit Suisse (ENA) Master Agreement would 
 not cover London Pulp & Paper transactions because they are not included in 
 the Services Agreement like ECC.  Please advise.
 
 Thank You,

 There is an ISDA Financial agreement in Global Contracts with ENA and Credit 
 Suisse First Boston International (95000405-0), dated 21/4/1993, but it's in 
 the Houston Maintenance group, and therefore Antony Campos should confirm 
 whether it's ok. I will be speaking to him as soon as he gets in.

 Please could you confirm whether Credit Suisse First Boston International 
 have a Master Agreement in place for Pulp and Paper products with ECTRIC or 
 ENA? They have just been approved for trading on Clickpaper without 
 collateral and I wanted to make sure that they did not have a master in place 
 before I went ahead and set them up on the system.
 
 thanks
