 Dear Mr Kaminski,
 
 Firstly, I wanted to tell you how privileged I feel to be considered for
 some of the opportunities within your prestigious firm.
 I am strongly interested in what Enron Global Markets has to offer in its
 research side.  Your Training Program is widely recognized within the
 financial industry as being one of the best, and I would be more than
 honored to be part of it.  I believe that as member of Enron I can learn a
 lot more quantitative ways of trading energy products, and I can also learn
 how to get a feel for the Energy markets from some of the best people in th=
 e
 business.
 Thus, I would sincerely appreciate to be considered as a potential member o=
 f
 your rotational program.  Indeed, I believe that my employment experiences
 have provided me with valuable skills that will be very useful in your
 Group.  These skills include the ability to synthesize quantitative
 information quickly and accurately, the facility to deal with sophisticated
 financial products, and more importantly the ability to work as part of a
 team by fulfilling responsibilities diligently and sometimes prior to
 deadlines.  I genuinely hope to contribute to Enron=01,s success by bringin=
 g
 these skills, along with my strong mathematical background and knowledge of
 the Energy Industry.
 Finally, I wanted to commend you on your high level of professionalism, and
 the clarity with which you exposed the opportunities available within Enron=
 .
 You surely are a genuine proof that your Group is committed to working with
 people who exhibit a superior level of professional capabilities.
