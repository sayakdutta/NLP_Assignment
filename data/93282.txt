 email I've gotten lately.  I'm such a great sister...I bought the present, 
 wrapped the present (or at least watched while the clerk wrapped it), and 
 delivered it to my mom for her birthday, and I was nice enough to put my 
 brother's name on the gift.

 Mom call the other day and thanked me for her present. What did I get her?
