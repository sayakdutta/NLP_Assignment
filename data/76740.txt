 head cold, so he is going home to go to  bed.  He will sigh and  moan, and 
 carry on like you wouldn't believe.  He will be incapable of discussing 
 anything other than how he feels.  
 
 
 
    
  
 Will do!  Neil called and he sounds like he feels awful!

 At 330 please get Sarah and Heather Brown (Bracewell) on the phone for me, 
 then I'll get Gregg.  
 
 Thanks,

 Kay, I told him the meeting was at 3:30 and that you would be calling him.  
 He also wanted Sara Wesner on the call x35261.  I also told her you would 
 call her.
