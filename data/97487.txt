 I have been asked to verify my understanding of Milbank's relationship with 
 Enron for a group of Pacific Gas creditors with whom TN has been in 
 discussions.? I sent them the following this afternoon:
 
 I spoke with Paul Aronzon, the lead Milbank Tweed partner on the creditors 
 committee engagement.? Aronzon said that Milbank Tweed does not represent 
 Enron as general counsel or in any other significant capacity.? Enron uses 
 Texas counsel when needed, but mostly relies on its very large inhouse legal 
 staff.? Milbank Tweed has a large energy practice and works on transactions 
 with Enron as lenders counsel, as counsel to entities in which Enron owns an 
 equity interest and as outside counsel on isolated bankruptcy matters with 
 Enron's in-house legal staff.? Aronzon said that if anyone has further 
 questions regarding Milbank Tweed's relationship with Enron they can contact 
 him directly (213-892-4377) or Lisa Mellencamp, Enron's general counsel (I 
 believe that she can be reached at 713-853-3820).? Milbank Tweed will also be 
 filing an application with the court, in connection with its representation 
 of the unsecured creditors committee, which will list all potential 
 conflicts.? This should be available on the court's web page - -?

 in the next few days.?
