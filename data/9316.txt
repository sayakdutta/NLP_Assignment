 
 Attached is a referral and resume on an HR professional that I thought might 
 interest you.  The referral comes from James Scribner, a guy that has just 
 accepted a job offer from me.  James and I worked together previously at a 
 bank, and he is very discerning in his evaluation of talent.  When I asked if 
 he knew of any other talented people at Fleming (his current employer) that 
 we should know, he immediately suggested Tana.  His read is that she is very 
 bright, creative, and innovative.  She has worked on many special projects at 
 Fleming, but James believes that she would certainly consider a generalist 
 role as she learned Enron and would then "earn" her way into managing special 
 projects.  I thought that I would give ENA a first look at this candidate.  
 If you are not interested or do not have a need, please pass this referral 
 along to other HR groups.  
 
 FYI - James will start work here on April 3.
