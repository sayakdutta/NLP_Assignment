 I asked for a list of major energy trading parties.  It seems to me that we 
 should try again to get those on the list that are not already members to 
 join ISDA.  Let me know if I can help.
 
 Regards,
 
 Mark

 I meant to copy you on this, but sent it before thinking.

 Last week you requested that I give you a list of about 10 counterparties 
 that you would forward on to ISDA.  Please note that the listed 
 counterparties came from information given to me by the documentation group.  
 In any event, the list is as follows:
 
   1.  AEP
   2.  Aquila
   3.  Coral
   4.  Duke Energy Trading
   5.  El Paso Merchant Energy
   6.  Koch
   7.  PG&E Energy Trading
   8.  Reliant
   9.  Southern Company Energy Marketing
   10. Williams Energy
 
 I hope this is of some help.
 
 Jeff
