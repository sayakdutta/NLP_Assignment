 
 I've had several phone calls with large customer groups over the past 
 24-hours, mostly explaining our noncore/core proposal (in contrast to the one 
 that the Assembly Democrats have launched which would saddle business with 
 100% of the utilities' past debts).  As folks know, the cost shift provision 
 of the Dems plans have been erroneously attributed to us in some cases.
 
 The business folks have been very appreciative of the discussions and have 
 recognized that, generally, our proposal is a fair and reasonable one.  They 
 are going to try to set up direct negotiations with Hertzberg and have 
 requested that I be part of those negotiations.  They are not sure that 
 Hertzberg will go along with the idea, but they're going to try.  They will 
 get back to me when they find out.  I'll report back soon as I hear 
 something.
