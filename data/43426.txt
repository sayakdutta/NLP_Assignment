 Stan, thank you for inviting me once again to the Arthritis Fdn. annual 
 event.  It was good to see you, but admitedly, even better to see the 
 pictures of your babies.  They are adorable.  I know you and Debbie are very 
 proud of them.
 
 Thanks to you and Enron for participating in this worthwhile event.  Janice
