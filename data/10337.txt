 	used all along to confirm the number against the ultra sonic meters.  We can
 	discuss further if you like.  Thanks. Lynn
 
  
     
 
 Given the Oneok Arbitration Decision, does it make sense to continue to send this report out?  Is it consistent with the decision in that PVR is not used on a going forward basis?
