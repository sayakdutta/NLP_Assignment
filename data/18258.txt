 
 Thanks very much.  I think, rather than Crawford, you might be referring to 
 David Cox, Republican leader of the California Assembly?  Really can't thank 
 you enough for you help on this.  Have a great weekend.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 One more e-mail!  I have calls into all the offices.  I need to call 
 Crawford's office back late on Monday (talked to his Chief of Staff - Matt 
 Back).  We left it that the others will call me back.
 
 Confirmed are:  John Bryson - 3:30 on May 2 in L.A. (I have a call in to move 
 that one later, if possible).
 David Freeman - 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. on May 3 in Sacramento;  Robert 
 Hertzberg - 1:00 p.m. on May 3 in Sacramento; Bob Glynn - 9:00 a.m. on May 4 
 in San Francisco.
 
 More later.
