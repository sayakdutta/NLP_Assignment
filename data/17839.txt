 I'm looking at hard copies of documents titled:
 
 Emergency Measures for Western Power Markets
 Possible Western electricity emergency plan elements
 
 
 Could you send me electronic versions?  Much appreciated.  I'll get back to 
 you with more siting information (per your email) on Monday.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
