 What's Happening?
 
 
 How's it going?  I will not be at rehearsal tonight because I'm going to get my hair done.  I figured that you all will be practicing (is that how you spell practice) your Easter songs and I will be in Omaha for Easter so I don't need to learn the songs, as we only sing them on Easter anyway.  Besides, just in case you didn't hear, we don't sing this Sunday (We switch with the kids), since you all will sing on Easter for all 4 services.
 
 This daylight savings time is nice.  It's so nice to be able to get home and still habe daylight instead of feeling like you whole day is shot once it gets dark.
 
 Did you find any houses that you liked?  How long were you out?
 
 Talk with you later!
