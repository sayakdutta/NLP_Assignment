 Saying linepack had stabilized, El Paso canceled an Unauthorized Overpull P=
 enalty alert Wednesday, one day after it had gone into effect. The pipeline=
  also said it will take Line 1100 between the Eunice and Pecos River statio=
 ns down for repairs June 26. Six interconnects will be unable to deliver in=
 to El Paso that day, and the total flow of gas through Eunice Station to th=
 e South Mainline will be limited to 245 MMcf/d. Plants upstream of Eunice a=
 nd in the Monument area will compete for space with San Juan and Anadarko g=
 as moving south from Plains Station.=20
 NOVA said it must reduce target linepack due to increasing soil and ambient=
  temperatures and to maintenance outages. It is seeking index-based uncondi=
 tional tenders through Tuesday for the firm sale of about 200,000 gigajoule=
 s. Tenders may be submitted for all or some of the reduction, which will be=
  accomplished through inventory transfers. The gas must be taken in more or=
  less even increments over a period of up to five days starting on or about=
  June 28, 2001. Call Darryn Rouillard at (403) 920-6341 for more informatio=
 n.=20
 ANR plans to begin maintenance Monday at its Havensville Compressor Station=
  that will run through Oct. 15 and reduce Southwest Mainline capacity by ab=
 out 125 MMcf/d. However, based on current flow levels the impact of the wor=
 k should be minimal, ANR said.=20
 Due to unexpected difficulties in operating the Bisti Station's #8 unit whi=
 le the C-1 turbine at the Chaco Plant in northwestern New Mexico is out of =
 service, flow from all wells in the GBISTI gathering system should remain s=
 hut in until turbine maintenance is complete, El Paso Field Services said. =
 The C-1 turbine is expected to return to service June 29. Operators must co=
 ntact Troy Chamberlain at (505) 564-4015, Corina Veloz at (505) 599-2357 or=
  the Control Center at (505) 599-2334 before turning wells back on.=20
 El Paso said Wednesday evening its Guadalupe Station turbine and the #3 tur=
 bine at Pecos River Station #3 turbine had tripped offline unexpectedly. Th=
 e Guadalupe unit was returned to service quickly that evening, but attempts=
  to restart the Pecos River unit have been unsuccessful. Capacity through P=
 ecos River is limited to 840 MMcf/d until further notice.=20
 NGPL reported discovery of a gas quality problem at the Transok-Bryan recei=
 pt point in Bryan County, OK. NGPL is working with Transok to resolve the p=
 roblem but said if it continues, NGPL may need to cut scheduled volumes at =
 the point.=20
