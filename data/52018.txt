 
 Rabi,
 
 You and Tanya  should go ahead with the course you have already registered 
 for.
 I have just mentioned it  FYI.
 
 I don't see too many problems  with the  course Stinson
 may help to arrange. The alternative course can be scheduled on premises, 
 late in the day
 and distributed over longer  time period.

 Vince,
 Tanya and I are registered for the offsite (Productivity Point) Java Class 
 (Feb12-16).   Before I go ahead and try to cancel the reservation, I need 
 some guidance from you (and/or Tanya) in light of the following issues:
 
 1.  Do you really want 15 people from the same group be unavailable at the 
 same time?  
 
 2.  Enron gets 30% discount from  the list price ($2125) of the Productivity 
 Point Java class.  Hence cost difference is $500 per person and not $1100 as 
 originally thought. 
 
 3.  Contents of the in-house class can be be tailored to match the skill  
 level of a more homegenous group.  
 
 Plese advise.  Thanks,
 
 Rabi
