 
 Hi Roger,
 
 We are going forward with the first deal to move stuff out of TurboPark.  I 
 don't know if you want to see these types of documents, but what the heck, 
 here it is!

 I am attaching a revised draft notice of intent to exercise the purchase 
 option for the equipment for the CA transactions. We need two separate 
 notices - one for CA I and one for CA II.  Ben/Fred/Rebecca, could you please 
 prepare a draft of the two exhibits?
  
 Lisa/Catherine/Rose, I revised the form of notice to make it track the 
 participation agreement and the development and construction management 
 agreement.  
 
 I've tentatively dated the notice as of this Friday.  By my calculations, 
 Monday is our drop dead date since a waiver of the 5 day period is not an 
 option, and the deal dies if not closed by the 15th.  
 
 Ben mentioned that I should be drafting a "release letter" for the banks 
 and/or DevCo. It would be a big help if someone could point me to the section 
 in the documents which set forth the requirements of the release, since I'm 
 still wading through it all and haven't found the relevant language yet.  
 Also, please advise of the results of the conference call which you had with 
 the lenders (?) and/or their lawyers regarding the issue.
 
 I am working on the assignment and assumption agreement.
 
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
