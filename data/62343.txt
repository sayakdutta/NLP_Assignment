 John,
 
 Does anyone report to you the EES-CAL positions? As of this morning, that book was screwed up, for example, it included the Nepool positions. Is P&L of $20.5 MM as of 1/30 correct? Also, no VaR is reported on these positions as of this morning.
 
 I am going to try to clean this mess up today.
 
 Vlady.
