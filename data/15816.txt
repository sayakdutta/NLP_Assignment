 state on its overcharges (about $240MM).  Note from structuring's analysis 
 that Alan sent around that Calpines share of the stranded costs is about 45% 
 of the total amount of stranded costs arising from the DWR contracts.  That 
 is, of the $9.5B (present value) of stranded costs, the Calpine contracts 
 account for about $4.4B  So, in exchange for settling on $240MM, Calpine gets 
 $4.4 B.  Nice work if you can get it.
