 
 Thanks for your help.  This sounds like a good fit for us.  The only issues I 
 have or need addressed is for this file to have the same name and have the 
 curves in the same cells so that we can just link to the file in our curve 
 file.  The other concern is that the data be there by 2:30 p.m. 
 everyday(prices for the next gas day).  Thanks so much for your help.
