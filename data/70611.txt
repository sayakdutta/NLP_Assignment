 
 Hi Rob,
 
 We are considering assigning a couple of the LM's to an Enron LLC, then 
 selling the equity.  I've taken a stab at the assignment & assumption 
 agreement.  Is this ok?  Has WestLB signed of on this form yet?
 
 This is the same transaction I called you about this am.  Any thoughts on the 
 notice question?
 
 
 
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
