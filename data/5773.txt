    I think we'll have a lot of fun this weekend.  Sierra sounds good to me.  I
    really like that place--I was just there the other night for a recruiting
    dinner and it's all decorated for Christmas.
 
    Jill, Matt's date, who works at Deloitte also lives all the way out in the
    Woodlands and she is probably going to come to my house and get ready.  I
    guess we'll figure out the rest of the specifics later.
 
    Tomorrow is going to be a pretty rough day here at my client; so give me a
    call tomorrow night, if that's ok.  Or you can email me--for some reason I
    didn't get your email until 5:30 today and it looks like you sent it during
    lunch.

 Hey Shirley,
 
 I just wanted to drop you a line and tell you that I am looking forward to
 Saturday night.  I don't know the specifics yet, but Chad and Matt had planned
 on going to Sierra for drinks at around 7:30.  I'll give you a call tomorrow 
 to
 let you know all of the details.
 
 See you soon.
 
 -Eric
