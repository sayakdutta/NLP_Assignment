 Mike and Eric,
 
 Informally I was told today that the new President of PDVSA Gas will be 
 Nelson Nava, this is very good news for us since he has been a very strong 
 supporter of the project for a long time. We have a solid relationship with 
 Nelson, so I believe he could be a good sponsor for our project. More 
 importantly, we will not have to educate Nelson about the project. Just in 
 case you don't remember, we all met him when we visisted PDVSA-Gas earlier 
 this years. The meeting in PDVSA-Gas was in his office.
 
 Once it is official, it would be a very good idea for you Mike to call him to 
 congratulate him. I will let you two know next week.
 
 Emilio
