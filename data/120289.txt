 Here is the message I received from my technical folks. (below in red).
 As you can see a lot of work is involved.  Let me know how much you would
 plan to nominate at this point, etc.    And can they committ to a certain,
 volume, etc.   Also,  have they talked to HPL about taking gas at this
 point.
 
 
 After visiting the site (M&R 71886/76886), I found the following work that
 would need to be done before custody transfer measurement could be
 performed :
  (The site has two 12" meter runs with valve switching (bidirectional flow)
 and run switching - and has not flow gas in over 10 years)
 
 1. All valves will need to be inspected & overhauled
      A. Run switching valve - major overhaul (needs to be sent off for this
 work)
      B. Control valves - inspected & overhauled (needs to be sent off for
 this work)
      C. Small regulators overhauled
 2. Both meter tubes pulled and inspected
      A. Sr. fitting needs to be overhauled
      B. Tubes will need to be honed (needs to be sent off to have fitting
 overhauled and tubes honed)
 3. All transmitter need to be replaced
      A. Differential - 2
      B. Temperature - 2 (1 additional from original setup)
      C. Pressure - 4
      D. Direct mount manifolds - 2
      E. UPS system
 4. RTU boards need to be furnished
      A. Mother board
      B. STI REM
      C. Main terminal board
      D. Serial IO LEM
      E. Analog Output board

 6. Two sets of orifice plates (In .50" increments through Beta range)
 
 It would take at least 1.5 months to re-work the station controls and
 associated valves, meter runs, and EGM.  If you need more information
 please let me know.
