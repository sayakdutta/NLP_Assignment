 
 	Should we discuss before answering Greg?  My answers are in the blue.  I appreciate any feedback.
 	Thanks. Lynn

 Thanks for the clarification.
 
 On number 4 is still a little fuzzy.  Does Demarc Deff. get allocated during the
 same cycle as Demarc?  [Blair, Lynn]  Yes, during same cycle, but at a different time.
 Seems unlikely since Demarc Deff. is a storage pt and
 storage is allocated at a different time?
 
 If we were nominating our Firm from Beatrice to Demarc Deff. where would our
 customers pull from? [Blair, Lynn]  Customers can pick up gas at demarc def.  
 The storage that is offered by NNG's park and ride is at what location?  Demarc
 or Demarc Deff.? [Blair, Lynn]  	Demarch def.

 > relation to mandatory monthly cash out?

 >         Answer - The field Receipt to demarc deffered delivery
 > IS included in a demarc allocation
