 It was nice meeting you and Jana again. I hope you will have terrific 
 vacation.
 It's likely to be very hot, wherever you go.

 Dear Vince:
 
 Jana and I really enjoyed having dinner with you and Ludmila last Saturday 
 night.  It was very nice getting to meet and visit with Ludmila.
 
 We will call you later this month after we get back from vacation.
 
 Sincerely,
 David Phillips
