 think that we'll likely come by either before or after the dome trip this 
 weekend.  I can pay you then.  
 
 I'm not looking to make money on the grapes.  Just looking for someone to 
 finance the development of my land.  And I'd have a vineyard to look at all 
 the time!  That'd be enough for me.  Thanks for all your help.

 The champagne is $10 per magnum. 
 Of course you can order the zin - when do you want to pick it up? 
 Thank you for making me laugh a lot. 
 I have asked our vineyard guy for some names and he will be getting back to 
 me shortly.  He thinks the best person is probably someone from KJ who does a 
 lot of stuff up there.  Should have it soon.  He was not overly encouraging 
 in terms of making money!
  
     
 Great to see you guys, and despite all the excitement, it was alot of fun. 
 Hope that you made it back safely.  Couple of things: 
    I'd like to talk to several vineyard consultants, so if it ain't too 
    much trouble, and you've got a name, I'd love to check around. 
    Can I order two cases of coastal zin? 
    What about the champagne?  How much per magnum is it? 
 Best, 
 Jeff
