 
 Hey Julie,
 
 Congratulations on the promotion, that's so exciting (I'm sure you've more 
 than earned it).  
 
 I just wanted to drop a line and see how work,  your new apartment/roommate 
 and Brendan are all doing.  All are wonderful I hope.  I realize this is 
 somewhat random, but I just found some great airfares from Houston to San 
 Diego ($99 each way!!!) and was wondering what you were doing the weekend of 
 Dec. 15?  I know this time of year is kind of crazy so I will totally 
 understand if you have holiday parties, etc. to attend.  Regardless, this 
 deal is good for travel through the end of February 2001, so....if it doesn't 
 look like it's going to work before the end of the year, maybe I could make a 
 visit mid-January or February.  
 
 Have a great holiday weekend and I'll talk to you soon.
 
 Susan
