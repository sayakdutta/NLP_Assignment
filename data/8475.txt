 
 I am so glad that you joined us for dinner, as well.  I noticed that the Dean jokingly said that the scholarship checks were "in the mail".  The University does send those checks to the students, so please let me know if you have not received that.  
 
 It was a pleasure again to visit with you over dinner.  Please keep me posted on your plans after graduation.
