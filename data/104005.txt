 Sara,
 
 here is online (web based) convertible trading site hat I could use - kindof 
 like an online broker where they match up buyers and sellers.  I take it that 
 before we enter to any agreement with them you need to approve it all.  
 
  I have not looked at this document yet, so please feel free to make any 
 comments you may have.
