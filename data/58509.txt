 
 My copy shows long term comp on the exhibit under "Grant Award".  And yes, 
 the date will be revised.

 The contract Mark gave me to review yesterday only covers monthly salary.  I 
 had expected there to be some discussion/reference to long-term comp plan.  
 Mark had mentioned that what he gave me did not deal with certain non-compete 
 payments owed to me in 2000, so I am not looking for that, but I did think he 
 had said that there was something in the doucment re:long-term, which I 
 cannot find.  Please advise if I am missing something.  I will withhold other 
 comments for now, except to note that the draft was dated 13 March, and had a 
 14 day period before expiry (now passed), and will assume that that is an 
 irrelevancy.  Look forward to hearing from one of you. mcs
