 Per our  conversation of date, attached is ECT's most recent version of the 
 ISDA Schedule and Credit Support Annex designed for use with Argentine 
 counterparties.  As we discussed, I would like for you to review this format 
 and determine whether changes are required as a result of legal developments 
 in Argentina.  Please call me when you have had an opportunity to review the 
 document.  We have had sent out several recent drafts using the attached 
 format.  Also, any written materials which might prove useful are always 
 greatly appreciated.  Thanks.  Sara
 
 P.S.  I will try to schedule some time when I am in the B.A. office.
