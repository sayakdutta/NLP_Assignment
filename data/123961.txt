 I would love to start the process of cleaning up the scheduling system.  We will need help from the schedulers as well so can you send Duong Luu their logins and request the 'Zero Volumes' application in EnPower.  There are many people asking about what is flowing and the month is creeping by so if you could get with me tomorrow to make a game plan that would be great.  I think we should have the schedulers send us their spreadsheets with an explanatory and then we, along with Unify users, will come up with a plan.  I hope to use the schedulers in this process as well, let me know your thoughts.
 
 Thanks,
 Stacey
