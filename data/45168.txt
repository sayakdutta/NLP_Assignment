 
 Mark,
 
 I am sorry, but there seems to be a little confusion in our shop about who 
 your attorney should be on this deal.  I was given Andrew O'Connor's name, 
 and left him a message to which he finally responded.  He is now expecting to 
 see this CA.  I have now been given Wesley Fredericks name as your attorney.  
 I don't want to cause any conflict between attorneys, and wanted to get your 
 direction as to how I should handle this.
 
 I am Tana Jones, and I am a paralegal in the Legal Department and my phone 
 number is 713/853-3399.
