 A reminder of the Forecast review meeting with Stan Horton on Friday, February 23rd from 3:30 - 4:30 in 49C2.  Please note that Danny is traveling and will not be able to attend the meeting in person.  
 
 At Danny request, Dave Neubauer, Steve Harris and Bob Hayes should plan to attend all future Forecast meetings with Stan.  The meetings can be located on the Planning Calendar on the ETS WEB.
