 Jeff, 
 
 I will be meeting with the Texas land office on Thursday morning and would like to send them the attached tomorrow for their review prior to the meeting.  The attached is a Letter of Understanding (drafted by me based on your prior letter of understanding).  It is specific to the Kathleen Ann storage field and includes the current owner of the field as a third party to the letter. 
 
 If at all possible, I would like you (or your designee) to review, modify and resend to me so that I can send it to the land office tomorrow.
 
 Thanks,
 Brian.
