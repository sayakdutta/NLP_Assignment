 CG-would you be willing to agree to my number of 4,053,906?  It would help 
 much
 with the storage documentation for the sale to NPC. Lunch at Chik-fil-a is on
 me.
 Thanks.
 
 
 
 
 


 

   
 
 
 AND my COH balance effective 7/31/2000 is 4,053.932 ( a difference of 26dt's).
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
    
 
 
 Here are the theoretical storage volumes based on the schedule, not noms...

 We need to reach an agreement on the theoretical storage as CES needs to
 transfer to NPC a specific volume and price for COH, and AGL ESS, WSS and
 Sonat. I had thought we had an understanding that CES would be billed, per
 Melissa's memo of 3/15 and conversations during June, the percentages times
 the
 current month's storage capacity. We may have confused you by sending FOM
 noms
 for storage injections that were different than that formula, and Doug has
 noticed the bills from ENA tend to represent the noms.
 
 How should this be resolved? Should we go on ENA billed volumes or by the
 formula? Let me know.
 My calculations per the formula would give us the following balances for
 7/31/00...
 COH-4,053,906
 AGL-Sonat- 504,379
 AGL-ESS-9,827
 AGL-WSS-220,209
