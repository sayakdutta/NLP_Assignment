 
 Mary Hain said she would get the paperwork going on this master agreement. 
 Either Mary or I will be in touch to let you know when this is in place.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate

 Can you check with Cara and see if this deal should have been put in as a 
 buy/resale.  We don't have transmission with this entity (WAPA-CRSP).  Let me 
 know.
