 Dear Sirs,
 We are an electricity utulity in Zambia which is undertaking a World Bank funded Power Rehabilitation Project.

This we have been trying in conjunction with your Embassy office here. As can be seen from the message below we require a feedback from the relevant person or any one of you TODAY! Please reply to us as a matter of urgency.

 Dear Mr C.Robberts
  
 Zambia Power Rehabilitation Project:
  
 During the shortlisting for Contract CD 94-95 your company, Enron International, was one of those shortlisted for the contract. Later the component of transformers was removed and packaged separately as TD 98. We are about to send out Invitations to Tender for TD 98 to all the previously shortlisted companies.
 As a matter of urgency, please confirm to us the contact Email address, Telephone, Fax, Postal and physical addresses. Reply to both  Emails shown below.
 Regards
