 how long is you spinning class and is it the one off shepard ?
 
  
     
 that's fine, i don't recall saying you did not want to go - but whatever..
 I had the estimate redone on the shutters today and it came to $5600 (inc. tax)
 this includes the ones in living on 1st floor, 2nd floor master and wood blinds in other rooms
 as well as a vinyl shutter for 3rd floor shower
 I am trying to make it to a spinning class tonite and am leaving at 4:30 -will go
 straight from spinning to restaurant..so let me know how to get your stuff to you

 I realize that to decline an invite is no big deal to you
 and actually I prefer to go alone tonight anyway
 but could you please be more considerate in your approach
 and not wait until the last minute to give me your decision
 thank you
