 I am unavailable Wed - Fri next week.  We really need to discuss this and 
 have the agreement executed.  
 
 Tracy and I propose 12 pm EST (11 am CST and 9 am PST) on Monday, April 30.  
 We believe this will be a very short discussion.
 
 Please reply to both of us.  Thanks.

 Tracy and I would like to discuss the "Transfer" issue with you tomorrow,
 if possible.  We think this should be a short discussion (maybe 10
 minutes).  How is 1 pm NY time, tomorrow Wednesday April 25?  This seems to
 be the most convenient for both of us, but we will entertain times before 3
 pm NY time.
 
 Would you please email your response?
 
 Thanks.
