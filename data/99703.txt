 The steam turbine is 95% re-assembled and should go into a 24 hour oil
 flush this afternoon.
 This will follow with 24 hours on turning gear.
 We anticipate lighting off CTG #2 on Saturday morning, followed by CTG #1
 mid morning Saturday.
 Gas and electric noms are out - if anyone foresees any problems
 accomplishing our goals, especially over the weekend, please advise.
