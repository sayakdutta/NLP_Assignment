 Jeff,
 
 I visited the Networks-sponsored Houston Technology Center and had a chance 
 to interview with all the people working there. I believe that a rotation 
 there could give me the opportunity to learn a great deal about the 
 entrepreneurial/technology circles and at the same be a good tie-back to 
 enron for my third stage. I would appreciate any suggestions or comments you 
 might have. Again, thank you for your help.
