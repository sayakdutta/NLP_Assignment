 Attached is a summary of SCE's filing to End the Rate Freeze with analysis 
 and some recent statistical data.  I am also forwarding SCE's filing.  In 
 short SCE's proposal would:
 
 End the Rate Freeze and implement rates on January 1, 2001, without due 
 process;
 Guarantee SCE 100% CTC recovery;
 Provide SCE shareholders with additional windfalls;
 Use stranded benefits to subsidize SCE's Standard Offer Service; and
 Entrench SCE in the default service provider role and thwart future 
 competition.
