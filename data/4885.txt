 Hector- Don't you know that the following weekend is the BIG Fantasy Football 
 draft?  What were YOU thinking?
 
 

 



 
  
 
 The weather for this weekend is not looking good. I suggest we do this the 
 following weekend.

 I know that Christa sent an e-mail about this a couple of weeks ago, but I 
 wanted to follow up.  Does anyone have any interest in going to Austin Friday 
 night and then going tubing in New Braunfels on Saturday.  
 
 Let me know. Forward this to anyone you think mught be interested.
