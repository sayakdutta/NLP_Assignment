 Hi Amy
 
 A colleague of mine interviewed someone last week who is a PHD whose
 background is as a developer within catastrophe risk management. He is
 looking to move into more of a quantitative role which will utilise his
 developing  skills and also his statistical and theoretical knowledge as
 well. The issue is that he is based in Chicago and I wondered if there
 would be any interest from your headquarters there.
 
 Please find attached his details.
 
 Speak to you soon.
 
 Regards
 
 Simon
