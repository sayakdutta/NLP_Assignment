 NETWORK WORLD FUSION FOCUS: DAVE KEARNS on NOVELL NETWARE
 Today's Focus: Filling in forms automatically
 03/23/00
 
 Dear Wincenty Kaminski,
 
 Today's Focus: Filling in forms=20
 automatically
 
 By Dave Kearns
 
 You've probably started switching to electronic documents (rather than
 printed forms) for your users. Perhaps you've created an expense report
 template in Excel that has the fields your accounting department is
 interested in.
 
 But if you want to really impress the users, how about templates which
 automatically populate themselves with user data (names, departments,
 etc.)? If you've got NetWare 4.x or 5.x and use Microsoft Office, you
 can do that - quickly, easily and (best of all) for free.
 
 Novell Directory Services-Enabled Office is a tool for automating the
 task of filling in standard forms with user and departmental data from
 your NDS directory. It=01,s based on ActiveX controls and uses Visual
 Basic scripts to feed that data into your forms.
 
 To use NDS-Enabled Office, you must create Microsoft Word or Excel
 templates that contain Visual Basic script macros that call users=01, NDS
 data, such as their names or departments. You can then send your
 templates to any employee in the company, and when the employee opens
 the template, the document will be filled in automatically with that
 employee's NDS information.
 
 The NDS-Enabled Office installation includes sample templates. One is a
 Word fax template, and the other is an Excel expense report template.
 
 It saves paper, saves employees' time and it=01,s free. What are you
 waiting for?
