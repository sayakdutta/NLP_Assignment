Also, delete the privilege header.  I want Georgetta to have a clean copy she can circulate internally in her shop.  In my cover email to her I'll suggest the sentence I'd like to be able to include.  MKM and others--please let me know if I'm good to go on sending this to Georgetta.  Thanks.  df
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 

   
  
 
  <<4%M3RED.DOC>> In my haste to get the draft out, I omitted a couple of changes in the last few paragraphs.  Please ignore the previous draft.  Thanks.
