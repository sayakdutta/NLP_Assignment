 
 Ed:  Jason Peters is an A&K lawyer working with us for about six weeks and 
 he's helping on these agreements.  We would like to meet with you about these 
 lenders and update ENA's position.  Could you please send me the "comparison 
 chart" which you prepared for these banks and ED&F Mann and Paribas, and let 
 me know when you are available to meet?  Thanks.  Sara
