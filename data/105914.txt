 not just Master Swap Agreements.  It is also listed in the approprate Section 
 13 entry.
 Hope you're enjoying Canada!

 The above counterparty has been created in the Financial Trading Agreements 
 Database and is listed as a master swap agreement, and it's not.  It is an 
 Electronic Trading Agreement and needs to be moved down to "Other 
 Agreements".  Please let me know when that is done and I will delete the 
 entry in  the master swap agreement database.  Thanks!
