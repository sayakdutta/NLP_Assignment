 
 Susan's draft has inspired me to vent months worth of frustration at the 
 Commission.  To save Susan from trying to translate my weird scribbles, I'm 
 having Martha type up my vitriol.  Please hold off on detailed comments on 
 Susan's draft unless you've already finished them.  I'll circulate a revised 
 draft to you all later today.  In the mean time, Susan and Frank and Steve, 
 are there not some cases in which the Commission has specifically granted 
 confidential treatment of precedent agreements or discount agreements in 
 expansion cases.  I know the bulk of authority is against us, but I seem to 
 recall at least a few stray decisions where the Commission granted confid. 
 treatment (even if only for a limited time).  Lets talk.  Thanks. DF

 Attached is my draft of a request for rehearing.  It incorporates Mr. 
 Stojic's and Mr. Kelly's initial comments.  Please review it and let me know 
 if you have any comments on or before Tuesday afternoon (I will be out of the 
 office Monday).  Thank you!
