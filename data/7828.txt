 
 Could there be other counterparties that have the same concern as Hess?  You 
 will have to explain to me what the issue was.  Thanks.  --Sally

 Talked to Steve a few minutes ago.  We will adjust our process as necessary 
 to allow Hess to aggregate trades on a daily basis.  I do not know the reason 
 we stopped doing this but we will revert back to the old process.  Let me 
 know if you need anything else.

 I received  a phone call from Steve Semlitz who runs Hess Trading in New 
 York.  He is frustrated with the new way he is dealing with settlement post 
 the introduction of EOL.  In that now we do not allow him to aggregate.  
 Please give him a call and find a way to resolve his problem.
