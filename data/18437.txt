 
 Greetings:
 As folks heard, Ken Lay met with some California CEOs last Friday back East.  
 As a result of that meeting, McNealy, CEO for Sun, asked for some background 
 and more detail on what Ken Lay proposed as a solution for California during 
 his meetings in California over the past couple of weeks.  McNealy and others 
 have expressed a willingness to make phone calls to policymakers, etc. to try 
 to advance the ball.
 
 I pulled this together very hastily on Friday and take responsibility for all 
 errors, omissions, ramblings, etc.  Wanted to distribute, however, to make 
 sure that all had the info that is getting distributed.  Know folks are busy, 
 but this will likely get distributed to other CEOs this week, so any 
 comments, suggestions, etc. about how to improve are welcome and appreciated.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
