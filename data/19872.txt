 
 So you're the one who gave me this cold.  Just wanted to let you know that I've been working on the resume (in between work and finals) and will try to have you a draft by end of this week, or next Monday.  Get better.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
 
 
     
 
 I will be going home after six this evening to nurse my cold.   We should 
 be open tomorrow evening till the usual 8:15 closing time.  Sorry for any 
 inconvenience this may cause.--John
