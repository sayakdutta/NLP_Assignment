 Greetings:
 This should be an interesting call.  I also have MTA working on how much
 Edison and PG&E have spent each day on their print, radio, and TV ads.
 Companies who have looming bankruptcies usually do not run daily
 multi-million dollar ad campaigns.
 
 Details:
 
 TELECONFERENCE Harvey Rosenfield, NETTIE HOGE and Harry Snyder "warn against
 phony bankruptcy threats, say legislature, Governor, PUC are getting
 stampeded by Edison, PG&E"
