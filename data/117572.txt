 My flight is CO4240 from Houston Intercontinental Airport arriving at 10:29 
 Wednesday night - operated by Continental Express.  I don't like to take 
 those smaller planes but at least this one is a jet and is a non-stop 
 flight.   It makes for fewer delays and it's that much harder for them to 
 lose your luggage.
