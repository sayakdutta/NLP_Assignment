 Dear Vince:
 
         I am in some preliminary dialogues with some faculty in the math
 department about the possibility of establishing a special program perhaps at
 master's level on financial engineering.  The attach pdf file is my own
 sketch about the program. Since you have extensive knowledge about these
 things, can you give me some comments.
