 Lisa - 
 Still fighting with the Mo-Jo huh??  How is everything going, are you able to leave with a smile on your face everyday?  Awesome that Susie is coming back, that should be fun for you guys, get the old team back together!!  Good luck with Law school, I think that is a fabulous idea, I think I might go back to school as well, but for what I am not yet certain.  I miss you too, we should get together in the relatively near future.  Say hi to Julie for me, Serena
  
  
  
     
 
 
 I'm great except for you know who...god we fight every day...it is so funny...what's going on with you?  you don't want to come back here do you?  i wish you would have stayed...apparently, they hired another consultant, remember Susie..she is going to work part time...we are not busy here at all..we terminated NEVP and SPP so i'm usually done by 11:00...talk with Murray...hows everything else going?  i miss you...i'm thinking about going to law school...crazy, huh but i figure this is my only opportunity to go back to school..i hope all's well...hang in there...its tough times but things always happens for a reason...let me know whats up...
