 
 Miss you guys too!  Thanks for asking about Meghan....she's going to be 2 
 next month (where has all the time gone?)!
 
 It sounds like you're having a terrific time too.  Been to Disney again?

 It's not the same without your smiling face!!!!!!
 
 I hope all is well for you and your family....how is that precious daughter
 of yours?  I bet Meghan is really growing!!  (sorry, I probably mispelled
 her name)
 
 We miss you very much but so glad you found a new "home".....(ie work place)
 
 I wanted to drop a line and say hello.....
 
 I'm enjoying working at campus.  It's very nice being close to home and my
 son's school.
 
 Take care,
 Sharee
