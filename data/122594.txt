 
 Thanks, Sue.
  
 Actually, today is my last day in the office.  I will start with KMI (doing Business Development)  in a couple of weeks.  I've got your phone number, I'll call you when I know mine and we'll set something up for later this month.
  
 I hope all is well with Dynegy.
  
 Thanks again,
  
 Kim.

 I'm very happy for you at your new opportunity at Kinder Morgan!  I hope we can get together soon so I can hear all about it!  Let me know your lunch availability.  What will you be doing at KN?  When do you start?
  
 You will do GREAT!  Congratulations!
