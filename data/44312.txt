 Dan, I had originally intended to send this to Clement but I was directed to 
 you instead.  For incoming guaranty issues, do I contact you or Clement?  
 Thanks.

 Walter,
  where you intending to send this to me or to Clement Abrams?
 
 
 
 

 
 Clement, attached is a guaranty draft from Enterprise Products Operating, LP 
 who is providing a guaranty to cover two new potential EOL counterparties, 
 Pontchartrain Natural Gas System and Calcasieu Gas Gathering System.  Please 
 review them and let me know if there are any comments or questions.  The one 
 comment I'll make is that we are unsure of our comfort with the dollar amount 
 that they propose, but everything else is probably OK.  I can be reached at 
 5-3595.  Thanks for your help.
 
 Walter
 
  

  
    
 Attached is the Guaranty we discussed earlier. Let me know if you have any
 questions.     Ken Theis
