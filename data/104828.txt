 
 Lisa Palmer and I had a conference call with the Xerox lawyer and commercial 
 person.  The main issues are the following:
 
 No CSA (claim to have over 40 ISDA Masters none of which contain CSA's! and 
 not set up to handle collateral)
 Rating downgrade is a Termination Event.  (Maybe they'll agree to our posting 
 L/C's 
 MUST have cross-acceleration (POLICY).
 Guess what else?  NO NETTING (can't handle netting internally)
 
 Otherwise, Xerox is cool.
