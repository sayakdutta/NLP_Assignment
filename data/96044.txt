 Dear Elizabeth,
 
 Please find attached the latest version of the PG&E Summary. We believe all 
 of the technical bugs have been kicked out of the document. However, you will 
 still need an extra-memory capacity printer in order to print. Please let me 
 know if you have any comments or would like any changes to the document and 
 we would be happy to make those changes. I hope all is well in Houston.
