 nd Declaration that I have sent back to Michael this afternoon wherein he e=
 xplains what happened yesterday regarding the tentative ruling and asks for=
  oral argument. When I spoke to Michael late this afternoon about the decla=
 ration I learned some additional information which is contrary to one of ou=
 r assumptions, and suggests it will be harder to expect the court to go for=
 ward with argument on Monday. Through this afternoon(when I had discussed t=
 his separately with Richard and Robin today), we have been operating on the=
  assumption that only telephonic notice to opposing counsel of the intent t=
 o argue was required to have oral argument in SFO court and that notice to =
 the court itself was not required. If so, the court would have this one on =
 its Monday calendar. I asked Michael again how the Court would know what ma=
 tters would actually be on the oral argument calendar and was told today th=
 at the telephonic instructions from the court which accompany the tentative=
  ruling tell you before listening to the recorded ruling  that apparently Y=
 OU HAVE TO PUSH A CERTAIN TELEPHONE NUMBER BUTTON AT THE END OF THE ORAL RU=
 LING IF THE MATTER IS TO REMAIN ON CALENDAR FOR ORAL ARGUMENT. That was not=
  done by the person who first called and listened to the ruling for Michael=
 . When someone called back and attempted to do so the response was "invalid=
 " or something to that effect. Presumably that was because it was sometime =
 after the 4:30 deadline. This would suggest that we are not even on the cal=
 endar (without a request for oral argument)as we had hoped. I still will be=
  there to argue, or at least argue for a hearing date. I wanted Bob to know=
  of this new info in case it affects his decision on coming out here. Call =
 me on my cell 619-985-9792 any time if anyone has questions. I will be emai=
 ling the draft replies for Sacramento tomorrow.
