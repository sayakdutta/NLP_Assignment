 Dear WEN Members-2000:
 
 We have not received your 2001 membership applications.  You are in danger of 
 being dropped from the membership directory for 2001 and from receiving 
 monthly luncheon notices.  Please send in your application for 2001 (see 
 attached form) and your $30 membership dues AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!
 
 In the past, the WEN Board has sent you a copy of the monthly luncheon
 meeting notice and the bi-monthly newsletter by both e-mail and regular
 mail.  The WEN Board recently voted to discontinue sending notices by
 regular mail.  Beginning with this e-mail message, you will receive future
 meeting notices and the WEN newsletter by e-mail only.  Those members for
 whom we do not have an e-mail address will continue to receive their
 notices by regular mail.
 
 Keeping the above in mind, please make sure that you print the attached
 meeting notice as an extra reminder to yourself to sign up for the luncheon
 since you won't be receiving the hard copy in the mail.  We hope that you
 approve of this method.  If you have friends in mind that you think would
 be interested in attending our next luncheon on February 14, please forward
 the attached luncheon notice to them.
 
 Additionally, the Board also voted to begin publishing the WEN newsletter
 on a quarterly basis rather than bi-monthly.  We look forward to sending
 you your next newsletter in April.
 
 For your information, we will be sending a survey to you in the near future
 to gather your input about suggestions for making WEN even better.  We
 value your opinion, so your responses to the survey will be greatly
 appreciated.
 
 Don't forget that we will be having a Networking Happy Hour for all WEN
 members on Thursday, February 1, at Mesa Grill, 1971 W. Gray (713-520-8900)
 beginning at 5 p.m.  Hope to see you there!
