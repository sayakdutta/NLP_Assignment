 agreement with Reuters limits our ability to modify their content and 
 restricts what we can say about the current nature of the quotes (they are 
 time delayed) and second, we don't want our time stamp to make people believe 
 that the quote was even current as of that time - since it won't be.  It 
 might be ok to have the entire quotes section headed by a line indicating 
 when it was last refreshed.  Many sites providing quotes like this have a 
 line (usually towards the bottom) indicating the delay period and most people 
 using those sites know they have to refresh their screen to update them.  
 Jason Peters is the expert on the terms of that agreement, so if you still 
 feel like you need to add something you might check with him.

 As I understand it, the answer is 'no'--we get a quote from Reuters but not 
 the time stamp.  The time stamp that would appear is the one that we place 
 next to it, telling the user when the quote was placed on the site.  So if 
 you happen along at noon and you see 'ENE 70 9am', you know that you're most 
 certainly not getting a recent price.

 Will the Reuters feed contain a time stamp?  Some other sites let you know 
 what  time the trade was done that resulted in the quote.

 Dear Mark
 
 Do you know of any legal issue that there could be about adding our own time 
 stamp to a stock quote from Reuters (so that people viewing the site would 
 know when the stock quotes were last updated by us)?
 
 Let me know if I should direct this question to someone else.
 
 Thanks Mark
