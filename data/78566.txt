 
 I'm sure this doesn't  matter, but I'm in Jeff Hodge/Barbara Gray's cost 
 center.  Just so long as I get paid!
 
 4-13 was a vacation day.
 
 Thanks again,
 
 Kay

 Since Suzanne Adams is out of the office I will be inputting time for Sheila 
 Tweed's Cost Center for this pay period.  Please send me your time for the 
 pay period 4-1 through 4-15 by 5:00 p.m. on Friday (the 13th).  You may reply 
 to this e-mail with any time exceptions such as vacation, sick, personal, 
 jury duty, etc.  Basically, any time not working!
 
 
 Kay:  Early Monday is fine. 
 
 Thank you!
