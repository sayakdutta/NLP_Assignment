 
 Are we going to do anything for the students before fall semester?  The 
 dinner with Dean May and others from the University is great in the fall.  
 But last year, we had thought about just a small lunch with the students and 
 a few from Enron.  This can be simple and we don't have to coordinate around 
 the schedule of any UT faculty or staff.  But it does allow Enron to have a 
 more immediate follow up with the scholarship recepients to celebrate their 
 being chosen.  --Sally 
 
 







  
 I am pleased to announce the recipients of the 2001 University of Texas Enron 
 MBA Excellence Scholarships:
 
 Christopher Cashman 
 SooPang Tang 
 Holland Brown 
 
 Each student will receive $10,000 in scholarship money based on their essays, 
 interviews and on how they exemplified the vision, values and beliefs of 
 Enron.
 I have already notified  the winners, so  please join me in congratulating 
 each one on a job well done.  
 
 Special thanks to everyone who participated in the selection of the 
 winners.   Stay tuned for details on the date and time for the Scholarship 
 Awards dinner slated for early next semester!
 
 



 
 
 
 FYI... All of the candidates that interviewed were outstanding according to 
 the scholarship interview team (Sally Beck, Andrea Reed, Roger Ondreko and 
 Loftus Fitzwater).  I will be sending each of them a letter to thank them for 
 their participation and encourage them to consider Enron when interviewing 
 for full time opportunities next semester.
 
 Thank you,
 
 Karen Marshall
