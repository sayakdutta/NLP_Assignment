 passes dropped.
 
 Unfortunately, I don't have Ernie's number.  He called me one time at about 
 11 pm on a Saturday from someone's cell phone he had borrowed and left no 
 number.  Typical Ernie. 
 
 How are the wedding plans going?

 G,
 
 How's it going?  The horns had a decent season I guess.
 
 Hey, do you know how I can get a hold of Ernie?
 
 Let me know.
 
 GT
