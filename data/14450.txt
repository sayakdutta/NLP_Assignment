  modifications to make CAS accessible to customers).   Let me touch base wi=
 th my team to talk about this concept & I'll get back with you.

 On a similar note: in trying to come up with a settlement in the negotiated=
  rates proceeding, we have discussed the possibility of allowing shippers t=
 o directly input a receipt and delivery point perhaps with a certain time p=
 eriod in mind to determine if capacity is available.   What I'm thinking of=
  is like letting them have access to our CAS system with us giving the fina=
 l ok as to capacity availability.  This would help IS who argue that our re=
 ports are not user friendly.  Legitimately, this type of instant informatio=
 n is all they should really need (as opposed to us having to post every dea=
 l we do--why should they be able to steal it at the last minute by slightly=
  outbidding the deal or forcing a tie in a maximum rate situation when they=
  really didn't initiate a specific request for capacity.   It seems like th=
 is is something we would want to do, but there a lot of outstanding issues-=
 -is it feasible from a systems standpoint, is it economical, etc?   Is TW m=
 ore doable than NNG since it has fewer points?  Greg asked me to get with y=
 ou to see if this issue can be further explored.  I do believe Steve Harris=
  and the commercial group are interested.  Pls. let me know what you think.=

 Here is my recollection of the sequence of events. The concept of an operat=
 ionally available capacity report and what it contains are already in GISB =
 standards.  FERC then picked up on this concept, added design capacity & sa=
 id that the report needs to be updated at each nomination cycle in Orders 5=
 87-L and in Order 637 transactional reporting.  GISB has since adopted stan=
 dardized data formats for the transactional reporting, recently published i=
 n GISB version 1.5 standards.  While these standard formats have been adopt=
 ed, and I believe that we are following these formats, they haven't yet bee=
 n adopted by FERC -- so other pipelines may or may not yet be following.

 I'll try to look at the NGPL posting over the weekend and compare to ours. =
  Also - I'm sending your email to Theresa Hess to confirm my recall of the =
 standardization.

 Indicated Shippers in their Reply to our Reply brief (at 19) argue that we =
 implied that our capacity postings are consistent with the standardized Gis=
 b format.  They compare our postings to NGPL's, which are different, to sup=
 port their argument.  Then they conclude that there is no standardized GISB=
  capacity-posting format.  Is this true?  How can we respond if this comes =
 up at oral argument tomorrow?  Maria
