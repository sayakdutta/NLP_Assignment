 Paragraph 4.  Please note that:
 
 Par. 3 Credit Support Agreements - Guaranty  
 this assumes that we have the signed guaranty on the date of the Confirmation
 
 The Enron Corp. guaranty in favor of ConEd was submitted to our Treasury 
 group this morning for signature.  As of 5:30 p.m., it had not been returned 
 to me.  I have left a message with Treasury and hope that I will receive in 
 the morning.  Please advise (1) fax number of person to whom I should fax 
 guaranty upon my receipt and (2) person/address for FedExp delivery of 
 executed guaranty.
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions.
