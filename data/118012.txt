 about the DealBench system - you should probably check with her.

 Certain of my commercial folks have asked if they are able to access 
 Dealbench which requires a point and click acceptance of the site access 
 agreement.  As dealbench is an Enron site I think it is okay for us to agree 
 and access the site; however, I wanted to know if you know of anything 
 unusual about the site or access thereto.
