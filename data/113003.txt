 FYI.  Cities' response to the AEP settlement offer I forwarded  earlier.
  
 

  Attached is a file with the Cities'  changes to teh AEP 10-03 discussion document.  The attached document does  not represent an offer of settlement by Cites but is provided in order to  continue the dialogue in this proceeding.  Cities also reserve the right to  suggest changes to the discussion document upon further review.
