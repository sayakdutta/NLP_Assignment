I am not sure it is the best use of your time. I am flying to SF to meet w/ Gary on the day of the 3rd to catch up on FERC issues You may want to come to that.

 I think I mentioned this before to you. Dave Noonan and I jointly own a 3 bedroom condo in Park City, Utah. If you and your wife, with or without kids, want to get away for a break(and remain beyond the California borders), you are welcome to use it. It sits vacant most of the time.
