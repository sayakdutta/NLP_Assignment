 In response to your question, yes, Edison did file in federal district court 
 in L.A.  The filing asks the judge to force the CPUC to 1) declare that the 
 rate free is over and 2) raise rates to compensate Edison for its 
 undercollections.  (Recall that this filing comes on the heels of the court 
 agreeing to hear Edison's case asserting that the CPUC must let Edison pass 
 through the power purchase costs to customers.)
 
 The filing is apparently very large.  The lawyers at the CPUC have a copy but 
 said that it's much too large to make a copy and aren't willing to give it to 
 us to make a copy for ourselves.
 
 Question to the lawyers:  Do we have contacts in L.A. that can go to the 
 courthouse and get a copy of the filing for us?  Probably a good idea to have 
 that filing passed around to this distribution list.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
