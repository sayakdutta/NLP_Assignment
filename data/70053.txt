 Here are my suggestions/comments on Rev. 6
 
 Definitions.  I think we need a Business Day definition, and a search and 
 replace of business days for Business Days.
 
 1.55 The definition of Performance Tests is really a definition of 
 performance test reports.  I think we need a definition that incorporates the 
 tests listed on Exhibit E.
 
 The phrase installation option is used, but I didn't find a description of 
 the installation option when I did a search.
 
 3.14.2.1  Is 6 months enough under this circumstances?  Does it matter?
 
 4.3  Delete "Each".
 
 5.1  The amounts on Exhibit N don't match what I have on the last option 
 agreement, and there isn't a description of any options, unless I'm 
 interpretting it incorrectly.
 
 5.3 (ii)  add "as provided in Section  5.5"
 
 6.4  I may have missed this, but I didn't see where amounts owed by Seller 
 would be charged interest if not timely paid.
 
 10.7  Are the roman numerals correct?.
 
 I am going to email you some new language for assignment and the buy back 
 option. You should have it today.
 
 Do you have a redline on this rev 6 versus whatever the version was I read 
 before?  I'm skimming it and I want to make sure I don't skip something.  
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
