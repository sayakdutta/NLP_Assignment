 
 So nice to hear from you.  Everything here is hot, hot, hot, 107 degrees 
 today.  Nothing new going on here, the boys are doing great, just getting 
 really big.  I'm taking Kendall to the Dr. today to see if he has an ear 
 infection, he was up most of the night last night (rats!).  Jordan is so 
 cool, he taking gynmastics again and loving it.  Kendall is my little 
 roughneck!, he reminds me of myself, he's hysterical.  I am so glad I have 
 them!!!!
 
 The wedding in Phoenix should be alot of fun, I think it's just going to be 
 Mom, Me and Nelle I think.   I'm leaving the kids with Todd.  Todd has a new 
 job where he works 12 hour shifts.  In fact, he's working with Ken Cowan,  
 but anyway it could be from 6 am to 6 pm or 6 pm to 6am,  It sucks when he's 
 working nights, but he really likes it.
 
 Anyway, we're supposed to be leaving early today and believe me I am ready to 
 roll.  Anyway take care, talk with you soon!
