 Marie.  In our last legal/credit meeting, Brant was going to call Christina 
 Tice, the CP credit manager.  Maybe this is a good one for Tana to stay on 
 top of Brant.  Your name is on this one.
 
 Also, nothing happened with credit on Friday.  Although Richard inquired 
 about Palladium.  I let him know that we drew on the LC's last week 
 (according to Tanya).  Sara
