 Robert/Richard - Montauk called yesterday and they've reached a tentative 
 settlement w/ WMI at Davis St.  They sent the most current draft but I can't 
 open it.  I've sent a message back asking them to resend but thought (at 
 least Robert) y'all might be able to open it and provide feedback.  Please 
 call/advise asap.  Thanks!

 by and among Waste Management, GSF and Ecogas.  Please have the draft
 reviewed and provide me with any comments you may have as soon as
 practicable.  If it is acceptable, I  will have an execution copy
