 I seem to remember that our traders in Singapore did a deal with a PRC 
 company a while back and it was our conclusion at the time that it was a very 
 dangerous (perhaps unenforceable) thing to do.  My vague memory is that only 
 financial institutions could enter into derivatives in the PRC and even then 
 there was invariably a sovereign immunity risk.  Do you remember this and can 
 you refresh my recollection?

 Mark,
 
 Cynthia Scneider recommended I check with you on the ability of Chinese 
 government-owned entities to enter into derivative contracts with Enron.  Has 
 ECT done any research on China?  Please see the e-mail below for details on 
 counterparty, size, term, etc.
 
 Thanks,
 Heather Mitchell

 Cynthia,
 
 The EI LNG Group is looking at providing LNG price risk management for China. 
 Could you please confirm whether China National Oil Company (Corp.?) and 
 China State Power Corp. are creditworthy counterparties?  Before Doug and I 
 talk to the traders I want to see whether we would even be willing to sell 
 LNG risk management to them.
 
 The structure the group is most likely interested in is 500,000 MT to 
 1,000,000 MT per year for five to 20 years (depending on what our traders are 
 comfortable with).  I imagine the Chinese would be interested in a cap or 
 collar, and not a fixed price.
 
 What other info do you need for a quick estimate?
 
 Thanks,
 Heather
