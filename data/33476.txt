 
 i would just call oxy and ask them.  there's no sneaky stuff anymore and its not like we would send them their money back either.
 
  
     
 what's your recommendation on how to proceed with margaret or internally?  i need to find out what the money is for.  i could always call over to oxy and ask my commerical person about it
 
 
  
     
 if the counterpart is in cash disbursements then yes, if its an accountant in an operational area then they should know what its for.
 
  
     
 from your vast experience do you think this is true?
 
 
  
     
 Somebody around here must know what they are for.  Our counterparts at OXY wouldn't likely know.

 i spoke with bjorn i credit and he wasn't able to figure it out.  could you or someone is accounting discretely call oxy and inquire about the two payments?
 
  
     
 
 Disregard the 10, 997,000. I found out what that was
  
     
 The receipts from Occidental were as follows
 
 $10,124,373.52  on March 22, 2002
