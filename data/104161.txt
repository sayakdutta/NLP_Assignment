 and Enron Australia; it was sent to David Minns via Federal Express on July 
 6, 2000.  Let me know if you need anything further.  Sara

 Hi Sara,
 I work with David Minns in Enron's Australian office.  Just a quick query - 
 can you tell me whether the agreement referred to below has been executed by 
 ENA?
 Regards,
 Robert.
