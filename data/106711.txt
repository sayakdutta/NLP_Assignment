 I do not know who should buy the shares.  Rick and Glenn, how do you want the 
 shares to be purchased and where do you want them owned?  Keep in mind that 
 if EPCA buys the shares and then sells them same day EDIDE (for example), we 
 will I believe need to open 2 accounts.  In addition, if the shares trade 
 over the exchange, I am not sure exactly how we will execute a private sale 
 between those 2 companies.  It seems to me that you may want to have the 
 ultimate owner actually make the purchase and then try to structure your 
 cashflows to accomplish your tax goals, rather than to accomplish those goals 
 by moving around the shares.  We can talk about this tomorrow but the sooner 
 we have the structure in place the sooner the account(s) can be opened.  We 
 will need to coordinate this structure with Corp. Treasury (Cathy Moehlmann 
 and Robin Veariel).
 
 Regards,  Bruce

 Please let me know which company needs to open a brokerage account in 
 connection with the CIESA transaction.  Once you tell me which company it 
 should be, we can start the corporate authorization process and I will 
 coordinate with Marie Heard of ENA concerning other information she'll need 
 in connection with opening the account.
 
 Please bear in mind that it will take some time (I'm not certain exactly how 
 long--I will find out) to get all of the proper authorizations and other 
 paper work into place, once you have decided on the company.
