 You recently received an e-mail from Terrie James regarding a video we are 
 working on for the upcoming Management Conference.  We have been able to lock 
 in a date and time to do this taping on Thursday, October 19th, from 4-6 
 p.m.  We are still working on the location for this taping, but plan on this 
 taking place in close proximity to the Enron Building.
 
 Can you please let me know if you will be available to participate in this 
 group session?  If not, we will be following up with some individual taping 
 the week of the 23rd.
 
 If you have questions, feel free to contact Terrie James on Ext. 37727, or 
 myself on Ext. 36631.
