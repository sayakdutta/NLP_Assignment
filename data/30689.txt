 Please review the attached schedule (the tab that shows first only).  This is what I want to give to the Commercial VPs and Danny.  
 
 Tracy, I will need your numbers please when you can get them to me.  Tracy, I took your Plan from the schedules James compiled.  Let me know if your Plan has changed too.
 
 Steve/Dana:  please review to see if I have grouped it the way you want.  I put the 0.1 plug in 4th QTR in Margins.
