 Dear Friends and Colleagues:
 
 NYMEX    is hosting a cocktail reception and a simulated open outcry trading
 "class":
 
 Thursday, Sept. 28, 2000
 5:00 - 7:00 pm
 Houston Center Club
 (downtown-across from the 4 Seasons)
 
 This is being held in conjuction with the Crude Oil Association.  They charge
 $25 at the door.
 
 However, as a host I can have as many of my colleagues there for FREE!
 
 But,  I must know if you are coming by September 24, 2000 c.o.b., to give a
 count to the Houston Center Club.
 
 I hope you can all attend.  Please feel free to invite someone to come with
 you. The simulated trading will be held three times during the evening, and
 is very interesting.
 
 I look forward to hearing from you, and seeing you on 9/28!
 
 Jana
 
 ps-call me if you have any questions
