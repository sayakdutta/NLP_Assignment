 
 Nelson,
 
 We can go to Memphis on Friday. I would discuss first with Gary and Elsa
 the scope of what we shall reveal.
 
 We can shoot ourselves in the foot if we reveal our pricing technology to
 consultants.

 Elsa called me late this morning with regard to extending the scope of our agreement with Sparks.  As we discussed, they have offered to help us with our forward curve development and would like to meet with us next Friday in Memphis.  The key point of contact there is Dr. Rob Murphy.  Let me know your thoughts and availability for that date.
