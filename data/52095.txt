 See below for more information on the Willis analytic product.  I will 
 provide the brochure when it arrives and we can discuss scheduling the 
 proposed meeting.

 Jim,
 
 1. I can confirm that CHARM does express traditional exposures in a VAR
 format.  One of the beauties of CHARM is that it expresses any quantifiable
 exposure in a VAR format, i.e. financial, insurance, weather risks.  In
 addition, it has the capability of incorporating correlations between risks
 - to the extent that they can be quantified.
 
 2.  To get the ball rolling, I will send you a broschure of CHARM this
 week. I also suggest a conference call with Carl Groth of our NY office.
 Carl knows CHARM well and my thought is that we can give you some more
 ideas of this product in order for you to decide whether or not you would
 like to pursue a presentation. A presentation can be arranged at the
 location of your choice.
 
 Let me know if the above fits your purpose or if you would prefer to move
 in another direction.
 
 Regards,
 
 Bertil
