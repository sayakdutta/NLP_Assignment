 I received the following information from Oneok concerning the missing Mt. Jesus payments.  Lisa Voth, the condensate accountant for Oneok, stated she need the volume statements from Debbie Mosely reflecting the Mt.Jesus volumes and production periods.  Dan, do you have access to Debbie's spreadsheet statements?  If I can be of any assistance, please let me know.
 Lynn, I left a message with Sherry Rodgers requesting all stranger gas statements dating back six months.

 Each month I receive run statements from third party vendors showing volumes
 of condensate purchased during the month, I also receive field tickets to
 match up to the statements.  In regards to the Mt. Jesus location, we do not
 receive such documentation.  We have no way to distinguish if any volumes
 were purchased from Mt. Jesus since we do not receive statements, nor
 tickets.  Our trader, Jon Hanna received a spreadsheet showing volumes NNG
 believes we owe for the Mt. Jesus location.  Can you send me the
 documentation NNG is using to come up with these volumes.
 
 Thank you,
 
 Lisa Voth
