 Attached is an edited file for the ABB/Fountain Valley agreement. I have 
 removed and made revisions to several sections to make it specific to the 3 
 units for Fountain Valley. Specific revisions include:
 
 Exhibit B1
 - Page 23, revise quantity from 6 to 3
 - Pages 43 through 86, delete pages specific to other designs
 
 As noted in the forwarded e-mail, the contact information in Sections 25.1 
 and 25.3 needs to be revised to replace Purchaser -
