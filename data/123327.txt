 
 Jim,
 
 Greg received a faxed copy of a slide on ENA - Wholesale Power Network from 
 Kathyn Corbally.  The slide gives a comparison in physical power volumes with 
 1st Quarter 99 vs. 1st Quarter 2000.  The slides shows a 5% percent increase 
 and Greg thought that you mentioned that the increase was closer to 20%.
 
 Please advise.
 
 Liz
