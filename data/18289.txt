 
 I apologize, but I can't make this call, though I'm confident that you folks 
 can handle it.  I'm available Friday afternoon (though I don't that will work 
 for Jim Steffes).  Let me know.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 I have sent Janet Covington the participant list as requested per her e-mail 
 below.  She has agreed to set up the conference call for Thursday, May 3rd at 
 3 PM central time.  Please reserve this time.  I will forward each of you the 
 spreadsheet we receive from them today.  I will let you know if I think we 
 should get together to review the spreadsheet prior to the call.   
   
 
 Thanks,
 
 Wanda Curry

 Wanda, I spoke with Janet after you forwarded her voice mail.  I told her we 
 would provide the participant list this morning.  Let me know if you want me 
 to do that.

 Hi Diann,
 
 I just left a phone message for Wanda as I didn't have her email and was
 supposed to coordinate the follow up call with her.  Anyway, we are still
 working on preparing the account examples demonstrating the change in
 methodology and should have those to you by tomorrow.  In the meantime, I
 wanted to go ahead and arrange the follow up call for this Thursday 5/3 at
 1pm PST.  That would be 3pm your time.  Can you please let me know the
 email addresses for your participants so I can get a notice out to them.
 
 I had yourself, Wanda Curry, Evan Hughes, Jeff Dodson, Bob Williams, Jim
 Doth, and Martin Curtilan?  Not sure of the spelling.  Please let me know
 so I can send out the meeting notice out with the call in details.
 
 Thanks Much.
