 
 I would think that the  LOC's for #s 2 and 3 should be for CA Energy 
 Development I and CA Energy Development II, since we will close on those 
 transfers next week.

 The accounting group received a set of 3 faxes from GE with information on 
 Letters of Credit issued by GE with E-Next Generation as the beneficiary.  
 These documents need to be countersigned and I don't know if anything else is 
 required to "activate" the LOCs.  I'll fax copies to you all.
 The documents are:
 LOC 1: $4,289,200  (for the 6 Fountain Valley turbines, since the amount is 
 5% of the total turbine cost)
 LOC 2: $717,600  (for Intergen turbine 1)
 LOC 3: $717,600 (for Intergen turbine 2)
 
 This is in accordance with the LM6000 purchase agreement (Section 6.1.3) 
 where GE must provide Retention Letters of Credit (the Retention Amount is 5% 
 of the purchase price) when E-Next Generation pays GE the final progress 
 payment (this final payment is scheduled to go out on 1/16/01).
 
 The LOC docs need to be counter-signed within 30 days and then forwarded to 
 the E-Next Generation, since they are the beneficiary.
