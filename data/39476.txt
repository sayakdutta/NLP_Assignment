 in the various locations where we operate.  Can your group do this as we work 
 on the legal presentations.  I believe this is already happening in part, but 
 I would like to make more institutionalized.  Let me know.   Mark

 I agree and am copying this message to Mark and Jeff- Thanks.
 
 
    
 I sent you along yesterday a copy of the e-mail re the participation by Rob 
 and me in the seminars that Blakes is doing for the traders and originators 
 in Canada.  Thinking about it more this morning, I am wondering whether the 
 seminars that Sullivan & Cromwell are doing in the US are too narrow in 
 their  focus.  That is, it is important for traders not merely to understand 
 the competition/anti-trust rules but also  the rules and practices of the 
 market surveillance panels or committees that operate, I think, in each of 
 the ISO jurisdictions.   It is that piece that Rob and I will be  trying to 
 add in Canada.  Just a thought in case you want to raise it withJeff Hodge or 
 Mark Haedicke.
