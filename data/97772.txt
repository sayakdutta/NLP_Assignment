 the small amount of potential exposure. Could you send me a copy of the 
 opinion from our local counsel.

 Jim,
 
 As you know, Jeff Skilling has approved opening a trading operation in 
 Columbia.   The company's open position at any one time will be no more than 
 $500,000.  Jeff Hodge and Francisco Pinto-Leite have been working  on the 
 trading contracts.  Our businesspeople inform us that they will not be able 
 to obtain counterparties' agreement to international arbitration.  We, for 
 our part, are unwilling to agree to refer all disputes to the Colombia 
 courts.  The best option appears to be arbitration conducted under the 
 auspices of the Bogota Chamber of Commerce.  We have obtained a written 
 opinion from local counsel, Figueroa Sierra & Asociados, opining that this 
 body has a proven record of conducting arbitrations fairly, without bias, and 
 free from corruption.  In particular, foreign parties have been treated 
 without discrimination, winning their fair share of awards.  We are 
 requesting that we be permitted to accept the Bogota Chamber of Commerce as 
 the exclusive forum for resolving any disputes that might arise under our 
 trading contracts.   I am aware that we have accepted local arbitration for 
 trading disputes in Buenos Aries; I am not sure whether we have done so in 
 Europe.
 
 Please let me know if this is acceptable to you, or if would like additional 
 information.    
 
 Thank you.
