 
 Jan,
 
 These numbers are slightly different from the ones you put together a few weeks ago.  Are you comfortable with the difference?  Any thoughts?  No hurry, I was just wondering.
 
 Thanks, Kim.

 Attached is the TW Top Ten Shippers by Revenues for the year 2001 to be reported in the Browncover report.
 
  
 
 
 
 
 Note:
 
 Total transportation invoiced for 2001 was $180.9m.  The amount of transportation revenues recorded in the general ledger is $165.9m.
 
 This difference is mainly due to the following:
 $10.0m   -   negotiated rates reserve(Reliant,Sempra, Richardson, Astr,and BP Energy) - $collected
 $ 2.7m   -    SoCal rate issue - $not collected
 $ 1.8m   -    additional month of PGE revenues due to prepayment invoicing beginning in 2001 - $collected
 Revenues for these customers were adjusted according.  
 
 Also, revenues for the shippers acquiring released volumes from PGE at rates above TW's tariff rates were adjusted accordingly.

 thanks,
 richard
