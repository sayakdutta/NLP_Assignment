 Can I get a change in Enpower?   We have done this type thing on the West desk:
 
 For every counterparty "Ercot Imbalance" ,   I would like the Risk Mark to market flag set to "off"  automatically.     When this manual process does not get done,  we have settlement problems.
 
 What do you think?
