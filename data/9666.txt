 
 FYI - I will meet with James on Friday when he is back from London to go over 
 the change in reporting for him.  I gave his review the end of last week, but 
 didn't get to review the reporting change.  I will ask Patti to let you know 
 when I am meeting with James on Friday.  Wanted you to be in the loop on this 
 - particularly when we are getting in front of commercial guys, I want this 
 to be well done.  The training may be great - I just wanted to make sure that 
 James knew about Avril's trip and that he was aware of the content and 
 delivery on the training.  Looks like he still has some homework to do.

 Have you seen the training tools that Avril uses for such things?  --Sally

 Please mark your calendars for EnTelligence Training on February 22nd.  
 EnTelligence is a system developed by Enron that provides a prospecting and 
 management reporting website combining information from internal and external 
 systems.  New enhancements to the system now provide Activity Detail reports 
 by counterparty.  It also contains Family Tree information for companies 
 (i.e. subsidiaries, division of... etc.).  Avril Forster from the Houston 
 office will be providing the training.
 
 We will divide the training into three sessions on February 22nd  as follows:
 
 10:00 - 12:00 Origination team training
 1:30 - 2:30 Energy Operations team training 
 3:00 - 5:00 Trading team training 
 
 All training will be in the Video #2 boardroom (next to Liz Prior).  Please 
 make every effort to attend this training.  Hopefully, you will find the 
 EnTelligence system a useful tool for each of you.  If you have any questions 
 or concerns, please let me know.
