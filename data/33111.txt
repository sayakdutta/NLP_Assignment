 Chris,
 I was speaking with Gerry Hrap and he said that they will require the number by tomorrow morning at the latest for negotiations with Calpine (per discussion with yourself, John McKay, and Scott Neil).
 Sorry for the rush,
 Nicole 
 
  
     
 Hey there.
 
  Got your message.  I'll get you the numbers by tomorrow afternoon, maybe today.
 
 Thanks
