 All the below figures were calculated using the 4500 hp factor on the 
 mainline ( TCV-12 Clark ) units
 and 450 hp on the ( 4520 Waukesha ) auxillary. Units 601, 602, and 603 are 
 the mainline units. Unit 621 is the 
 auxillary engine and runs back up power, if needed.  The year 1997 was 
 figured by Kerry Welch who no longer is with us.  
 1998, 1999, and 2000 operating hours and fuel use numbers were calculated 
 using the spread sheet that was provided by our mechanical analyst.

 The total throughput on condensate has been ( 0 gallons ) for 1997, 1998, 
 1999, and 2000. This is due to the fact that our narutal gas supply changed 
 in 1997 to a more dry natural gas and therefore, there was no liquids 
 associated with the gas.
 
 Again I apologize the inconsistency in the data.  We have had employee 
 turnovers at the facility and different spreadsheets were used to provide the 
 information to the EPA.  We are in the process of standardizing our data 
 collections to eleminate this problem in the future.  I hope this information 
 will help in the permit review process.  Again please accept my apologizes in 
 the data collection errors.
  
  
 
 
 
 

   
  
 
 Please confirm the following throughput and operating hours.  The
 information below was given to me by Butch Russell
 
 Compresssor Engine Operating hours  for 1997 is 38.87 *106 hp-hr??"         "                   "            "               "          "?1998  is 11.82 * 106 hp-hr
 
  Let me know the operating hours for 1999, and 2000.   Which HP was used in
 the calculation.
 
 
 The throughput found in the application  for 1998, the annual throughput
 for condensate  (gal/yr) is 115, 165 while the maximum hourly throughput
 (gal/yr) is 2,500.   The May 1999 data for both the annual throughput and
 the maximum hourly throughput for May 1999 read 0.  Please confirm this and
 let me know.
 
 Thanks
