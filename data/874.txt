 I have gone into travel planning mode and wanted to invite both you and
 Keith on a scuba expedition.
 
 Greg, our friend Larry Hudler and I are planning a trip to Fiji January 24th
 to Feb. 2nd.  All in, the trip should be about $2,000.  This includes
 Airfare, Condo, Diving, Food, and Drink, and maybe a little more drink.
 
 Let me know if either of you can attend.
 
 Darrell
