 
 Alan, do you want to talk with this guy while he's in town?  Michelle
 
 
     
 
 Michelle:  Steve's name isn't on my list of those resumes we discussed last week.   Are you and/or Alan interested in talking with him?

 Molly,
 
 You mentioned you would be out of town some this week -- any possibility
 that we could get a reaction to Steve Cochell's resume (attorney at FedEx)
 before you leave?  Steve will be in town this Friday (7/13) and Monday
 (7/16) if Michelle/Alan have any interest in speaking with him.
 
 Thank you.
 
 Elaine
