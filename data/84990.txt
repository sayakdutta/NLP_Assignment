 what they want for Section 6 and Jim has agreed to get with CPS to get 
 further definition.  I also recommend pulling the language inserted in 
 Section 3 as Jim indicated we have already submitted all the estimates.  The 
 Bexar county venue is unacceptable and will be stricken.  David Marshall is 
 reviewing the insurance section and should have an answer today.

 I have reviewed the changes which you have made.  Under Section 6, I have no 
 idea what we would submit.  Therefore I suggest that the additions under this 
 section be removed.  The insurance provision looks fine to me except that I 
 would like to see a larger umbrella amount, but you need to get David 
 Marshall to bless.  Is there a precedent for having Bexar County the point of 
 venue under this contract?  Upon your completion, please send 3 copies to me, 
 2 of which I will submit for execution to CPS.
