 
 Hello!
 
 Here is the latest draft on Garden State/Project Barbed Wire.  As I mentioned 
 to Dee, the agreement is due to be signed on Tuesday, 7/11.
 
 Dee/Rick, I just learned that there are multi-employer plans for the 
 unionized employees.   I'll provide details as I learn them.
 
 I guess you can forward your comments to me, with a copy to Stuart Zisman.
 
 Thanks.  Michelle
