 Mark,
 
 Thanks for a great presentation today.
 I have already received several comments 
 from people saying how much they enjoyed it.
 
 I've attached a few orchid shots.
 In fact, I will be showing them all on Saturday.
 My photo organization, Houston Center for Photography is sponsoring a print 
 sale.
 It is from 10 am to 6 pm this Sat. at 1441 Alabama (near the Menil).
 
 Hope you have a great weekend.
 Thanks again.
 
 Frazier
