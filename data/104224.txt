 Mary,
 
 Per your e-mail, I would like to delete (ii) in the defininition of 
 "reasonably withheld" as there is only one party that has a possibility to 
 have a material unhedged position (ie. Enron).  
 
 Thanks,
 
 Ryan
 
 The (i) Termination Date and (ii) each date specified as such in a written 
 notice from either party to the other party with respect to a designated 
 Number of Shares specified in the notice (the "Notice"), to which the party 
 receiving such notice consents, which consent shall not be unreasonably 
 withheld.  For purposes of this Confirmation, the parties agree that consent 
 shall be deemed reasonably withheld (i) if the party receiving the Notice has 
 a reasonable business purpose for maintaining the Transaction (excluding any 
 business purpose relating specifically to the existing or anticipated value 
 of the Transaction or any other Transaction subject to the Agreement) or (ii) 
 if consenting to the Notice would result in a material unhedged exposure or 
 liability for the party receiving the Notice.  For the avoidance of doubt, a 
 Notice shall be sent from either party to the other party on the Termination 
 Date.

 Kristina, please forward as you deem necessary to EBS persons for final 
 approval.  Thank you.
 
 Please see attached language concerning the Raptor swaps in respect of the 
 Valuation Date mechanism and advise me as soon as possible of your approval 
 or comments, if any.  We are trying to finalize all public swaps (save Active 
 Power) today, so your timeliness will be GREATLY appreciated by me!  Mary
