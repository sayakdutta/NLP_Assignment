 
 My apologies, Linda.  Sometimes it pays to see what name pops up from the 
 Enron address book before hitting the send button.  And thanks, Rick.  I'll 
 note the two r's in Rrobertson.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Rrobertson, not Roberts- maybe... Linda Roberts has some stroke w/ Diane 
 Feinstein!

 Greetings Linda:
 
 Let me open by saying welcome, and by apologizing for the fact that 
 California has probably made your first days on the job a bit crazy.  
 
 Just wanted to pass along some info.  I'm sure you've seen Senator 
 Feinstein's comments to FERC.  And I think you're aware that she held a 
 meeting in California with a group of stakeholders (including Davis staff) on 
 the day before FERC's recent workshop at which Steve testified.  She stated 
 at the meeting that she is thinking seriously about sponsoring legislation to 
 place a price cap on the entire WSCC market.  Economists in the room 
 expressed their strong misgivings about caps, but Feinstein seemed fairly 
 focused on at least sponsoring some sort of legislation.  Not sure where it 
 will go, but wanted to pass it along.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
