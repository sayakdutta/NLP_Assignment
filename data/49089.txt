 Dear Mr. Kaminski,
 ?
 Even though I cannot pass "official" interviews, I  would like to discuss 
 with ENRON. I was really impressed by your presentation  and I think I would 
 be a good fit for your firm.
 ?
 I know that you?will be soon recruiting on  campus, maybe we could set up an 
 "informal meeting". Either give me a call at  home (412-802-6429) or send me 
 an email at this address. I would appreciate  though not to appear on 
 interview lists.
 ?
