 Jason/Hilllary/Marc/Mark/Stacy:
 Please mark this time on your calendar so we all know how this is going to work.
 
 Vernon:
 Please be prepared to discuss:
    How we have our pools set up should help us or hurt us?
    Beatrice fits into the picture and if this is going to cause additional
    allocations.
    If Demarc gets allocated are big contract gets frozen so we can not adjust
    our nominations
    If this is the case should we release our contract to ourselves in the field
    zone so we would then have two contracts which would allow us to not have the
    same problem as described above.
    Review the amount of capacity to and through Demarc by line.
    Specific example that includes all the cycles.
    Can you have an allocation after the timely cycle?
    Our priority going to Demarc from the Field if we have our nominations in on
    time and do not change them.
    What would happen if we were on time and got all of our gas confirmed to
    Demarc and then one of our customers changes their nomination in our pool
