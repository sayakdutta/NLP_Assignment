 
 So I don't forget when you get back, I just spoke to John Allario, and we 
 either need to amend or draft a new NDA for General Motors to deal with some 
 new business approaches Net Works is making with them.  We'll need to 
 possible add in 3 other Enron companies, so when you get back give me a call 
 and I'll bring my notes around and we can discuss this.
