 Bill,
 
 For He 24 EPE was prescheduled to send 50mw to the ISO.  The schedule was cut earlier in the day.  There was no note on the model or in Lotus notes.  When the issue was brought to my attention by EPE gen. I looked in the service book and found a note about it.  I called SRP at 9:30 pst to verify that they were receiving the power.  Jose at SRP said he was receiving nothing from EPE for he 24.  The schedule was ultimately taken out.  SRP later called El Paso and said they were not checking out.  I discussed the issue with Jose and he did not agree that our conversation took place as it did.  I tried to get him to take out the schedule and he would not, so I suggested that we pull the tapes.  However, there is a tag for the schedule-  Tag#1125D.  In retrospect I should have given the tag# to Jose.
