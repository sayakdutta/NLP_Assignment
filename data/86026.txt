 Hi Gerald,
  
 Hope all is well.  Can you do me a favor and reimburse me for the remaining Rudy wedding/beach house costs?  I gave Bruce a check for $200 to cover you and I and I think my portion of the rental car was $50.  I'd really appreciate if you could get me the remaining $50.  
  
 Thanks.
