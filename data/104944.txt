 
 Per my fax (37 pages) of 8/29/99, attached are copies of (1) the existing and 
 proposed Annex A (general terms for the omnibus) and (2) proposed option 
 formats for ISDA and omnibus.  My purpose was to "ISDAize" the omnibus 
 particularly in the cap/floor/collar world.  Please note the Par.2 Payment 
 section and revised definitions.  You do not have "old" confirm templates 
 because I cannot acces on my computer (but all was included in the fax). Did 
 you receive the fax?   SS
