 
 Still not sure you actually work at Cox Comm.  since you haven't emailed from 
 that address and my email didn't go through!  I had better do some more 
 background checks.

 Hey there!
 

 
 Thanks for the so called e-mail yesterday! Ha!  Actually, I will check again
 when I get to work this morning.
 
 Anyway, hope you got all your songs downloaded last night and got a good
 nights sleep.  No more cramps for me last night.  I was very excited.
 
 Have a great day at work and I will talk with you a little later!  Also, I
 will find out what the definite plans are for Saturday night.  Like I said
 last night, the whole little birthday party may never come around.  We may
 have to be creative on our own!
