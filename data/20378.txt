 Question 1: Please explain the following line from your note: "I really need to get certified for diving."
 
 Question 2: How hot is it down there?
 
 Question 3: Cheap is good, but if you're going to travel that far to dive, is the diving good there, or is there another place (like Beliz) where the diving is supposed to be killer?
 
 
 
 
     
 
 I asked PP if she was interested in going to Honduras between xmas and new
 years this year.  I really need to get certified for diving and the diving
 there is extremely cheap, but reliable (its an American outfit and all
 PADI).  PP thought she might be interested in going and doing it with me.
 So, first I wanted to know what you thought of the whole thing.  Then, if
 you are into it at all I will look into flight opportunities (staying down
 there and the scuba course and single dives are all very cheap, but the
 flight would be the most expensive).  And, last, do you have miles on
 continental and are they miles that PP can take advantage of also?  I think
 Continental goes to San Salvador which is a common connecting city.  So, you
 might luck out on flight costs and the whole trip would not be too bad.
 What do you think?
