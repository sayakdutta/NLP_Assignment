 Sure looks like you like to pry!!!  (just kidding, Carson)  I've picked out a 
 variety of wine for the 16th, by the way

 Sara:
 
 I hate to pry but I might be doing some remodeling to my house in July
 and wonder what it would cost to duplicate your closet wine celler. Do
 you recall a ball park figure on the costs.
 
 See you on May 16th.
