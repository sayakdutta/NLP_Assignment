 
 Any idea how close it is to B & P's office, and how much it costs?
 
 Thanks,

 This is the hotel where you will stay in DC.  It was formerly the A&A or 
 something like that, but it's been renovated and looks very nice.  The 
 tickets are complete and on the way to be ticketed.  Got the Jefferson with 
 no problem.  I haven't seen the flights but I'm sure they are fine.  I will 
 defintely check them out.
