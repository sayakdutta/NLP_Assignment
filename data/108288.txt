 Can we try and get these LNG guys on 29 when we move Nowlan's group????  I 
 think there are about 15 of them.

 Jennifer,
 
 Could you please co-ordinate with Brenda Johnston (Rick's Houston assistant) 
 to help facilitate the move of the LNG group to the Enron Building.  I 
 appreciate your help on this issue.  Send me note when you are able to 
 confirm timing etc.
 
 Thanks
 Eric
