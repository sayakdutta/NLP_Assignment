 
 Great presentation, as always.  I think you should add a brief set of talking 
 points:  what are the key messages we want to convey? what, if anything, can 
 we ask Martens to do that would allow some progress in the short run?
 
 Maureen: please get this to Ricardo (he's at the EBS offsite this am).
