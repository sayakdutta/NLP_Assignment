 
 As things change, so do call schedules.  We conferred and have recommend that:
 
 There will not be a call this week.
 Beginning next week, the call will take place once per week, on Wednesdays, at the same time (11:30 AM PDT), same call-in number (we hope).
 Until the next legislative session starts up, the call will be optional for the gang in Sacramento.
 
 If you have any alternative suggestions, questions, and/or comments, please let me know. And please forward to others who need/would like to know.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
