 Drew Lynch has asked that I coordinate a project to determine if we have 
 employees in the correct companies (for U.S. companies) and do we know the 
 ownership structure of both domestic and foreign companies.  We will approach 
 this in three phases as below:
 
 Phase I - On our payroll system - do we have employees in the correct 
 companies in EPC and do we know which ones are wholly owned by Enron;
 
 Phase II - Not on our payroll but in the U.S. -  do we know who the employees 
 are, what companies they work for and how our ownership is structured;  
 
 Phase III - Not on our payroll and outside the U.S. - do we know who the 
 employees are, what companies they work for and how our ownership is 
   structured.
 
  I will have some preliminary work completed and would like to review it at 
 that time.
