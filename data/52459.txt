 
 Steve,
 
 Things seem to be under control as of noon today (Tue).
 I look fwd to the evening with you, your wife and the
 rest of the Woodlands gang on Saturday. I eat everything
 except for broccoli.

 Vince,
 
 Sean tells me that the structured deal libraries, probably requires a more thorough hand-over....
 
 ...do we have that expertise still in the building?... can we extend someone here to make that happen?
 
 regards
 
 Steve
 
 PS: I hope you and your wife can attend on Saturday 6pm?.... is there anything you both can't eat? (vegetarian etc...)
 
 
 
 
     
 
 Karthik,
 If you cannot find the answer, please call Zimin. I shall call him at home tonight as well. 
 Vince
