 like a career within Dynegy.

 Dear Mr. Lay,
 
      Enron's  dynamic growth in the field of energy
 during the last three years is truly remarkable. As a
 student of business, I am truly impressed by the
 strategic acquistions made by Enron in the area of
 power and its leveraged arbitrage with the gas
 industry.
      I would very much like to make a career within
 Dynegy and would appreciate very much if you would
 consider me for a Management trainee position in your
 esteemed organization. Enclosed is a copy of my
 resume.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Asad Rashid
