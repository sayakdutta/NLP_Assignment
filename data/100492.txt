 
 Hi Mum!  Sorry I have not called you back.  I have been out late every nite 
 and trying just to keep myself in constant motion.  Am on the trading floor 
 this week and can't really talk b/c too many ears.  But I'll give you a call 
 this afternoon.
 Our little bar examinee is alive and well.  They've changed the schedule so 
 the exam was over yesterday instead of Fri.  She joined me and my work crowd 
 last night at La Griglia and we ordered champagne.  So I've already 
 celebrated appropriately!
 What do you think of my Destin idea?
 talk to you soon
 Love,
 Sooz
