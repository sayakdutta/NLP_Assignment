 Hey Jeff, could we set up a short meeting to talk about the status of the 
 Elba off-take strategy? I'll have Christy set us up sometime this week. 
 Thanks.

 Janet,
 
 I wanted to drop you a quick note.  Things have been progressing nicely 
 between the LNG guys and Southern Company.  The LNG guys asked me if ENA 
 needed to get some MTM from Elba, they would be willing to quicken the pace 
 on putting a deal together.  Probably rushing is not in the best interest of 
 Enron buy it could be done.  Anyhow, I have legal and structuring working on 
 this and we may need you to help negotiate a transfer price between ENA and 
 Enron Global at some point.
 
 I think no matter what happens prospectvely at Elba, Southern Co has probably 
 saved the LNG group up to $50MM of capital clean up their off spec gas along 
 with provided a much better price of Hub +$.12 vs our current put option of 
 Hub + $.02 with El Paso which is an additional $36.5 MM improvement.  Let me 
 know what you thoughtsare.
 
 Thanks.
