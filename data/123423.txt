 
 Chuck,
 
 This is a read-only file.  I'm unable to print it out to show to Greg.  
 Please provide me with a hard copy.  Greg doesn't read e-mail regularly.  I 
 keep an eye on this e-mail and print out things that require his immediate 
 attention.  You may want to deliver me hard copies of the P&Ls.
 
 Liz

 Greg, 
 
 Here's the P&L as of last night.  When I get the newest one I'll forward it 
 along.
