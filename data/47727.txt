 
 Pursuant to the documentation the counterparty provided when they entered 
 into the power EEI, and at the direction of Marcus Nettelton, a lawyer in the 
 power group, the counterparty name for the Port of Oakland should set up in 
 GCP as follows:
 
 The City of Oakland, a municipal corporation acting by and through its Board 
 of Port Commissioners
 
 GCP, if you could please redo the counterparty name, and Stephanie, if you 
 could please resubmit the PA to match the counterparty name, then we can get 
 this one done...
