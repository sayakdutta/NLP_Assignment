 Attached is a ruling by ALJ DeUlloa issued yesterday pertaining to the
 calculation of the California Procurement Adjustment.  A draft decision was
 suppose to be release on such on Friday, March 16th.  It was not, and now we
 know why.  On March 14th, the Department of Water Resources wrote to the
 Commission to give the commission its views on how the CPA should be
 calculated. In his ruling of yesterday DeUlloa stated that he would wait to
 issue the PD so as to take into account DWR's submission. He also provided
 parties until tomorrow to file comments on the DWR letter (which is attached
 to the ruling).
 
 Not surprising, DWR has a different view of the world than the UDCs do when
 it comes to calculating the CPA.  The UDCs view the CPA as residual amount
 left over from the generation component of their bundled rate on 1/5/01
 after the cost of their retained generation (including QFs and bilateral
 contracts) are subtracted out. DWR views the CPA as a rate (i.e., a cent per
 kWh) which would be paid to DWR by the UDCs every month. It is DWR's view
 that a Total Generation Related Rate must be calculated which is a blended
 average of the cost of the UDC retained generation and the cost of the "net
 short" power.  From this total rate (e.g.., 5 cent) the cost  of the UDC
 retained generation (e.g., 2 cent) would be subtracted and the remainder
 (i.e., 3 cent per kwh) would be the CPA.  This CPA would be subject to
 further allocation by the Commission to determine the Fixed Department of
 Water Resources Set-Aside. DWR is not asking that such allocation be done
 now.
 
 DWR's view of the world would place it in a sounder financial position,
 making it a more viable purchaser of electricity for California, but would
 place the UDCs in more dire straights.
 
 Please let me know by tomorrow at noon if you want to comment on the DWR
 proposal.
