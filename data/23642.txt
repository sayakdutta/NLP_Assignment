 Stacy - 
 Steve spoke with Coral about the Transaction Agreements today.  They had the 
 following comments:
 Transaction Agreement #1
 1 - MaxDQ should be 20,346
 2 - 3.2 and 3.4 - LD payment equal to $0.15 plus 1.7% x Spot Price rather 
 than $0.017 x Spot Price
 
 Transaction Agreement #2
 1 - 3.2 and 3.4 - LD payments consistent with Transaction Agreement #1 rather 
 than $0.20 and $0.25
 
 I think these are all fine, but I wanted to run them by you.  I have made the 
 requested revisions to the attached Agreements for your review.  Let me know 
 what you think.
 
 Thanks - Gregg
