 The Peoples Energy Project is Currently On the Public Internet.  The version 
 that has been released is not in its final phase.  
 Many of the rules of the business have to be tested and changed to reflect 
 the correct data representation.  The only way 
 for us to do this is to have the current users who will be using the system 
 to verify the correctness of the data.  Due to this fact, it 
 is not recommended that this system be used for trading purposes until the 
 portion of the system being worked on is verified to 
 be in fact correct in its representation of the data.  It is still imperitive 
 that  this system is viewed daily for its correctness, validation, 
 fault tolerance and efficiency on a daily basis, for this is where we devise 
 our metrics on the systems completeness.  
 
 Currently there is a new update version of the application that resides in 
 Chicago that delivers the data to the website.
 Our current contact has been sent to a training in Canada and will not be 
 available until Jan 20, 2001.  Due to this I would like to set up a meeting
 to:
 
  Application Status Report
   1. Show the Parts of the application that currently are ready to be used
   2. Discuss the portions of the application that are currently in "Beta" 
 (not ready)
   3. Discuss a testing process to bring these portions up to Production 
 Status (ready for usage)
 
  Evaluate Current Project
   1. Does the project currently meet customer needs
   2.  Additions / Changes to fit needs
   3. Business Rules Changes
  
  Customer 
   1. Customer Site Feedback
   2. Developer / Management Feedback 
   3. Outstanding Issues
