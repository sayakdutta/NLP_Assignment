 
 Per our conversation, I am attaching a proposed form of Unanimous Consent of 
 the Board of Directors of Brant-Allen Industries, Inc. ("Company") that would 
 expand the Consent of Directors given to us when we executed the ISDA Master 
 Agreement in 1998 to do more than just the single trade referenced in that 
 resolution.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please have it 
 executed by the directors of the Company and return a copy to me for our 
 files.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me at (713) 
 853-3399.
  
 In addition, can you confirm one thing for me.  There is a note in our file 
 that says documents for the Company require two signatures.  I looked at the 
 Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws you provided us and find no such 
 signatory requirement.  Is this note an error?
