 My bible study lasted until 9:00.  I was exhausted.  I had been on the phone
 all day.  I am working this career thing very hard.  I am leaving in the
 morning for Tulsa to look at houses and apartments.  I have not excepted the
 job yet.  I have to be sure.  I also have some interviews set up for Monday
 and Tuesday of next week.
 
 I have to have faith that God will lead me in the right direction.
 
 I have to call Susan and Jon and apologize.
 
 What is Jon's phone number at work?
