 Reference number for show tickets (in case I lose them):

 Also, remind me to give you my tax return info.  Noel forwarded it to me
 yesterday, as it got sent back from the Rushing River address.  I got $500 in
 traveler's checks and $197 in pounds to start off.  I also plan on getting
 about $100 in US dollars before I go.  I'll start packing Wednesday afternoon
 to make sure I don't forget anything.  If you think of anything important for
 me (besides umbrellas and toothbrush), please let me know asap.  I would also
 appreciate a receipt notification from this e-mail, as it contains very
 important information.  Haha, do I sound official enough?  Tell Ann Ducharms
 and Ted Murphy that I appreciate everything they have done for me.  I think
 that's about it.  Talk to you later!
 
 All the very best,
 Jules
