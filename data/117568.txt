 Attached is a revised draft of our memo, blacklined to show changes.  Please 
 note that the draft reflects our most recent understanding that, in the 
 absence of a master agreement, GTCs will govern.  If this has changed, per 
 the recent e-mails, we will revise the memo accordingly.  Please call or 
 e-mail with any comments.  Best regards.
