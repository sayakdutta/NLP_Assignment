 
 Mark:  Your name was provided to me by John Greene who is temporarily 
 residing in Enron's U.K. office.  I am a lawyer in the Enron North America 
 Corp. legal department.
 I need to speak with someone regarding the London Instinet installation.
 Two different Enron  companies (both U.S. corporations) already have Instinet 
 agreements.  They are Enron North America Corp. and ECT Investments, Inc.  
 The London installation would presumably be in the name of a DIFFERENT 
 entity.  I need to understand in WHAT NAME the installation will proceed.  
 Please help to fill in the details ASAP.  My number in Houston is 
 713-853-5620.  I am this moment contacting David Terrace in London as I 
 understand he handles all documentation.
 
 Thanks for your help.  Sara
