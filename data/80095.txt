 Hello from S America.  I would recommend 2 people.  Both are obvious but 
 Louise Kitchen should do EOL and Ken Rice is the best candidate for EBS.  If 
 they aren't available they can pick an appropriate person.

 Mike,
 
 Who should we contact about getting Enron Broadband and Enron Online active
 with Interactive Texas (see www.interactivetexas.com)?  With such a broad
 cross-section of the state's senior leaders participating, including
 Skilling, Interactive Texas is going to be a major event.  We need to make
 certain Enron gets early access to exhibit or sponsorship opportunities.
