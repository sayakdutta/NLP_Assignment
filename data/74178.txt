 
 Good afternoon,
 
 Our son Michael will be in your class beginning next Monday, October 2, so I 
 wanted to introduce myself.  I hope we will get to meet in person soon. 
 
 Is there anything you would like to suggest that we do to make the transition 
 easier?
 
 I picked up the package of information today, and will read it tonight. l 
 won't ask any questions until I do my homework.
 
 I look forward to seeing you soon!
 
 Kay
