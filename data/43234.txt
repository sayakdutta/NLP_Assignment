 
 I got the Board book and note.  Thanks, it made my day.  I will be glad to take you to the Board meeting, and to the park & ride or home which ever you prefer.  Call me tonight.

 That's cool about lunch.  My tummy is feeling pretty gross anyway so it's best that I just live off salads and sandwiches this week anyway.  I am supposed to go to the meeting on Thursday, and would greatly appreciate a ride there and home.  After the meeting would you drive me to my car or home because I can get Mom to take me to the bus in the morning on Thursday if you'd rather take me home than drive all the way to the park&ride.  It's up to you, just let me know what's easier for you.  Did you get your board book yet for the meeting?  I mailed them all out this morning and put a little note for you in yours.  :)  I hope you're having a good day.  I'll talk to you tonight.  I love you!!
 Love,
 Caron
