 Vince,
 
 Regarding everything we talked today in all research meeting I was wondering how all these things are going to affect my situation. As we talked couple months ago I was trying to get ready to be employed full time in the new year. So in this case what do you recommend me to do? Shall we stick to what we talked before or shall we wait and see what time is going to bring? It'd be really nice if you could give some kind of direction.
 Thanks,
