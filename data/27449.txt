 
 Ken,
 Laurel will be sending the spreadsheet from now on.   I asked her yesterday to include you on the distribution. 
 I will be out of the office next week.   Clint Dean will step in for me.
 
 Thanks,
 JMF
 
  
     
 John - Don't forget to add me to your spreadsheet distribution.
 

 
 Thanks,
 
 Ken
