 
 Thanks for the invite (and the follow up voicemail).  I'd love to see the 
 General (and you of course), but I'm going to have to pass.  Thanks anyway.
 
 

   
  
 I would like to invite you and a guest to join me for the annual Juvenile 
 Diabetes Foundation Gala to be held on May 12, 2001 at the Westin Galleria.  
 The guest speaker this year will be General Norman Schwarzkof.
 
 Please contact Cathy Phillips (X-36898) and let her know if you are 
 interested in attending.  Thank you.
 
 Mike
