 
 Mike,
 
 Could you add two new categories of products to the database for me.  That 
 would include the "Yes, Yes with Limits, and No" buttons and also a comment 
 screen for the new products.
 
 The two new products are:  Credit Derivatives and Bandwidth
 
 Thanks!
 
 By the way, I can't figure out how to move the Portland masters off the 
 master swap list.  I think I am going to need your help with that.
