 Sorry I didn't get back quickly.
 
 You need to tell me what the premium translates into from a dayrate 
 perspective.  In addition, I thought you were going to write an outline of 
 what they would try to do in the next little while. (ie how much one way 
 exposure)  This way I don't have to get involved in every deal until they 
 prove to me that is big enough to allocate a risk manager to the market.
