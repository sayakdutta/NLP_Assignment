 Yes, the offer is coming. It may take a few days to process it, but you can 
 count on it.

 Vince:
 
 I did get your phone message about the summer, but I still haven't heard from 
 Enron about an offer for summer employment.  I do have other offers with 
 other energy companies that I must respond to this week.  Could you let me 
 know as soon as possible if an offer will be made to me.
 
 Sincerely,
 Kimberly Whitsel
 Wharton MBA Candidate 2002
