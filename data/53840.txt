 
 Jinbaek,
 
 There is still an error in the definition of
 the bid-offer spread.
 
 Can you look into it? I have sent it already 
 to Greg Whalley, my boss, before I caught it.

 How are you doing?
 Attached is the summary of yesterday's presentation,
 you asked me.
 
 I have no idea whom I should circulate this report.
 So please circulate this report to whom you think
 appropriate. [Mark Hall]   (I am going to send this
 to Zimin and Bob)
