 Whatever, do you think I have any control over Ramiro?
 
 If you do, you are wrong.  He really does not want to trade maybe that is
 his way of telling you.

 engram is ramiro's 4th receiver, you don't get a starting rb (the 10th best
 i might add) for a backup WR.
 
 the reason i want engram so bad is b/c i have his qb and i think he will
 have a pretty good year.
 
 by the way engram was picked the 8th round, dillon in the 2nd.
 
 so don't give me any of that

 Ramiro believes Engram is going to have a very good year.  He needs a
 Running Back.  I don't think he is being ridiculous.  Engram may be ranked
 30th now, but you obviously believe he is a little better than that or you
 wouldn't want him so bad.

 your boy is being ridiculous - does he really think he will get the 10th
 best rb
 for the 30th receiver?
