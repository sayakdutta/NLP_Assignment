 Kay -- We should check each on a case by case basis.  We probably would be 
 better off using any definition from the ILA since it was already found to be 
 acceptable by MDEA unless there is simply a better definition in the ESMA or 
 some inherent conflict or gap relative to the scope of the overall 
 agreement.  For any that are not obvious to you, please do not hesitate to 
 continue shooting questions at us for clarification.  Should we look at 
 Ancillary Services?   Thanks -- David

 What is your preference when there is a  conflict between the interim 
 agreement and the last draft (v23) of the ESMA.  (For instance, the 
 definition of ancillary services.)  Shall I just ignore the ILA, or does it 
 represent the customers' expectations?
