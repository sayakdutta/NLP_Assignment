 
 This is the latest on our status of calculating and reporting the DPR.  Ric=
 k Buy, our chief risk officer, asked that we get back to normal as soon as =
 possible.  I am currently working on termination statuses and when deals wi=
 ll be killed etc.  I am also working on a way to get the PCS cleaned up.  C=
 ontinue to run the calc with the true-up flag off as this will cause more c=
 onfusion than it is worth.
 
 Thanks,
 Stacey

 For the next few days, we will be reporting only positions, maturity gap, &=
  VAR for the DPR.  We expect to be reporting P&L for ENA again probably by =
 the middle of next week.
 
 The 11/30 DPR is still listed on the ERV as preliminary, as there are still=
  a couple small items outstanding.  The 12/3 and 12/4 DPRs should be out by=
  tomorrow.  We are currently experiencing some IT issues related to positio=
 n reporting which have prevented the reporting of these days.  I expect the=
  issue to be resolved by the middle of the afternoon today and we will repo=
 rt shortly thereafter.
 
 If you have any questions, please call me at 713 853 9123.
 
 Thank you,
