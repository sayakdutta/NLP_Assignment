 hows the new job?  
 
 i got your email from jai.  are we on for yoga tomorrow?  
 
 thanks for the scooby snacks (tasty) and stickers (plentiful).  normally i suffer some angst from stickers since i don't want to waste them, but you got me so many that it's not an issue.  did you have fun at the crazy horse?  i was quite drunk and unfocused but had a good time.
