 
 Those guys will do the full horizontals too wherever possible - I'll do the others
 
  
     
 Louise,
 
 I've seen a list where you nominate a set of business sponsors to represent NA interests, and it appears that the intention is to have single points of contact for each of the budget buckets.
 
 However, there are a number of horizontal initiatives, such as Global Data, that cut across all of them.
 
 Is it your intention that we take the horizontals to all the people listed, or will you nominate one to evaluate the budget numbers?
 
 regards
 
 Steve
