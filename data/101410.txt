 minutemade frozen limeade she'd promised to bring for our Eagles marg party,
 and the jerky from dad - suspiciously, she remembered my pocket-sized
 neosporin tube......but anyways, it would be FABULOUS if you and lisa could
 each cart over 3-4 tubes of the limeade wrapped in plastic
 (carry-on....obviously could be ugly in non-pressurized cabin in suitcase!)
 doesn't matter if thaws, but will need approx 7-10 tubes for the
 festivities, plus, dad has that great turkey jerky from NB to send
 along...."
 
 Fear not, I have the turkey jerky.
 
 Address...118 Portland Road (the postcode is W11 and the tube stop is Holland Park)
 
 Phone #...011 44 2072 43 1926 (this is with the country code so I'm not sure exactly what you dial in London, I 							know you have to knock off the 011 and possibly the 44)
 
 If you end up taking the tube you'll walk out of the tube station and take an immediate left.  Walk roughly two blocks and then take another right onto Portland Road.  There will be a pizza place right on the corner.  You'll walk all the way down Portland road until it looks like the road ends in a cul-de-sac.  The roads actually continues on the other side of a little bricked area with benches (a place called Janie's Wine Bar will be on your immediate left).  Emily's flat is in the row of flats to your right and the number is on the door (which if I remember correctly is blue).
 
 See you there,
 Sue
