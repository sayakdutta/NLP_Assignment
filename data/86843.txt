 Sorry about that! I've been sick and I guess I forgot. We had the show last
 weekend so it was pretty hectic around here too.
 
 This weekend, Sat or Sun at 3PM should be fine. Let me know which works for
 you.
 I don't want to promise too far in advance because of the erratic party
 schedule.
 
 Helen
