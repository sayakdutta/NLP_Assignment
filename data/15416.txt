 senator may have to fight over the surplus with a lot of teachers looking to 
 spend the $$s on school books.  That fight could get interesting if the 
 backdrop for the debate is a CEC report that sez "no problem, we're in 
 charge."
 
 I'm sure we'd be willing to build a few plants for $2 billion...

 I guess we're nationalizing the electric system here in Chili -- oops, I mean 
 California... I heard Peace wants to spend $2 Billion (out of a $10 billion 
 surplus -- hey, what's a few billion among friends?)  Also, rumor has it that 
 the Energy Commission just came out with a report saying there is no capacity 
 shortage for next summer.  Gee, I guess Senator Peace was right all along or

 Senator Peace is holding a press conference in Capitol Room 1190 at 11:45
 this morning.  Our understand so far is he will be talking about using
 General Fund money for the state to purchase power plants or build new ones.
 I will be attending the press conference and will report back.
