As far as dates go we have an Enron BOD mtg coming up which totally consumes us. This meeting is in early May, so after mid April it starts to get crazy. It would be easier for me if you gave me a couple dates and I will see if we can accommodate. Rick
 
  

  
 Rick,
 I think what would work best is a half to full day in Houston.  Then a month or two later to do a check up.
 This will allow us to tell you where we think we are, where we need to be and have you guys think about whether you would suggest anything different. 
 Over the next few weeks could you suggest a few times that might work.  
 
 In certain circumstances,  i would like to be able to have someone either w/i your group or perhaps a related group (e.g. kaminski) help in the interview process.  In fact,   I have a few candidates cueing up.  One is a PHD, Art Mazer of CL&P and i would love to be able to throw him past one of your guys.  I was thinking David Port.  Do you think i could borrow him for a phone interview.   I would like to do this asap so any input would be greatly appreciated.  Apparently, this candidate knows a few people w/i Enron and i'd like to run the traps on this  He does not claim that these are great ref's because he worked or knew them in limited capacity but any insight is valuable.   The names of the two people are Art Bieser (apparently worked at Entergy for a short time with him) and Alex Huang who he interviewed for a job at Entergy but choose Enron.  We would need to keep this on a P&C basis. 
 
 I had dinner with Marc Tarkington on Wednesday.  I tried to entice him but its highly unlikely given he is paid quite well and the credit role here is somewhat unique.  He sends his best regards to you.
 
 Thanks,
 Bill
