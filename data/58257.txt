 Attached is a draft of the Starwood press release with our initial changes in 
 red.
 Please review and let me know your thoughts by end of day Thursday, Aug 31.   
 
 It is clear that Starwood has several agendas with this release and, after 
 talking with
 them, they would prefer not to cut any of their messages.  Scheduled release 
 date is
 Tuesday, Sept 5.  Please feel free to call me to discuss.  
 
 Also - I've attached a map of all their US owned, franchised and leased 
 property locations.
 87 of the properties are owned and there are approx. 400 total in the US.
