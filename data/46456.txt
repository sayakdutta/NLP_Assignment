 the old confidentiality language in it that doesn't allow provision of the 
 agreement to affiliates, so we cannot not send this agreement without 
 Citibank's consent.  Matt, if you want it you'll have to get Citibank to tell 
 us, Enron North America, that it's ok to provide the agreement to you (ECT 
 International).  Sorry...
