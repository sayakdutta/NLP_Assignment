 
 I got your e-mail.  We are planning on coming.  Melissa is better, not 
 totally well, but may be on her way to recovery.
 
 Sorry about Jimmy.  He's having a heck of a time.
 
 
 
 
 

    
 
 Charlie,  Let me know whether or not you got my email yesterday about
 Mardi Gras.  Our system was on the blink so I'm not sure if you received
 it.  I hope Melissa is feeling better - Jimmy was up all night throwing
 up and having cold chills.  Love, Margaret
