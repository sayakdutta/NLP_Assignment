 
 I'm not sure specifically what you're refering to...Do you mean someone on 
 the financial book's love life (ie Susan or Kori), or the HR spy?
 
 Glad it worked, now maybe you won't get fired.  Have you gotten something to 
 eat yet?

 Thank you, it worked
  MS DOS definitely does not work for me anymore. It is weird because it works 
 when I send myself a message. Try sending yourself a message to see what 
 happens. Let me know. 
 
 Have you kept up with any new information about Risk people? You know what I 
 mean right ?
