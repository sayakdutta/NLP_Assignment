 We have been getting questions about the ability of potential customers to =
 sell power onto the grid to EPMI.  Below is a brief outline of the FERC lic=
 enses required.  Customers other than those listed below (including non-QF =
 industrial on site generators) need a power marketer license from FERC.  In=
  most cases, such customers do not need to file for EWG status (unless thei=
 r primary business is as a utility, like Enron). =20
 
 In addition, both EPMI and EES filed at FERC for authorization to perform c=
 ertain power marketer license functions on behalf of industrial on-site gen=
 eration customers.  We expect the authorization within a month.  I'll let y=
 ou know when we receive it and what we can do for customers.

 This email briefly responds to your question whether state agencies or muni=
 cipalities and qualifying facilities ("QFs") must obtain power marketing au=
 thorization.  The answer is no.
 
 With regard to state agencies or municipalities, section 201(f) of the Fede=
 ral Power Act ("FPA") states that no provision of Part II of the FPA, which=
  governs the regulation of electric utility companies engaged in interstate=
  commerce, "shall apply to, or be deemed to include, the United States, a S=
 tate or any political subdivision of a state, or any agency, authority, or =
 instrumentality of any one or more of the foregoing, or any corporation whi=
 ch is wholly owned, directly or indirectly, by any one or more of the foreg=
 oing, or any officer, agent, employee of any of the foregoing acting as suc=
 h in the course of his official duty, unless such provision makes specific =
 reference thereto."
 
 Section 205 of the FPA, which would would otherwise require an entity to ha=
 ve rates for wholesale sales of power on file with FERC, does not apply to =
 state agencies and municipalities.
 
 With regard to whether QFs need power marketing authorization, most QFs are=
  exempt (some small power production facilities are not exempt) from most p=
 rovisions of the FPA, including section 205, which requires public utilitie=
 s making sales of electric energy for resale in interstate commerce to file=
  rate schedules with FERC.  QFs are instead regulated under PURPA, which au=
 thorizes utilities to purchase power from QFs at the purchaser's avoided co=
 st.  FERC decisional precedent indicates that a QF can lawfully sell at mar=
 ket-based rates without seeking market-based rate authorization from FERC, =
 but that it may nevertheless be prudent for a QF to seek FERC acceptance of=
  a market-based rate schedule that would provide protection in the event QF=
  status is lost.
 
 Let me know if you need anything else.
