 Hi 
 Chris I'm sitting in the second row with the 4-panel Bloomberg screen  (next to Belden)... drop by.
 
  
     
 Hi Mike, I'm looking for some general numbers regarding the basis and wheeling costs from mid Columbia to Montana.  Are you the person I should be going to on this?  I'm looking for some numbers to get me from today thru 2024.  If you can provide me any length of time in this range it would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks,
 
 Chris Mumm
