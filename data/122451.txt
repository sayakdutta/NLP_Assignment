 Kim, 
 
 Those ideas sounded pretty good.  I got a list of places from Lisa also: 
 
 Benjy's (on Dunstan by Ballys) 
 Raven Grill (Bissonett) 
 Goode Company Seafood 
 Sierra Grill 
 Floridita Seafood Grill (the place on Kirby/Richmond) 
 Tony Mandola's Seafood River Oaks 
 
 Any of these sound good to us.  I think Lisa's preference is to avoid "heavy" places, and go for either a place with variety or something that's more seafood oriented.  However, we're flexible.  By the way, 6:00 p.m. sounds perfect.
 
 Whatdaya think?
