 
 Mark:
 
 I don't know what your schedule is this week but I want to discuss ENA's response to counterparties who do not respond to our request for settlement calculations and methodology (e.g., Goldman Sachs Capital Markets, L.P., J.Aron, etc.).  I understand that you may not be the lawyer to handle a response; this is a "protocol" issue.
 
 Also, on the financial trading side, I have another "protocol" issue with respect to nonpayment by non-terminated counterparties (under the ISDA, GTC's or Master Energy Price Swap Agreement).  Specifically, let's discuss ENA's approach and use of a possible "test case" in this area.
 
 Thanks.
