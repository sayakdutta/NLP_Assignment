 Spring 2001 Faculty,
 
 The Spring 2001 Schematic has been posted to EMBANET.  To access the
 Schematic please open the JGSM Area icon on the EMBANET desktop.  Next
 please open the Announcement JGSM icon.  You will find the Spring 2001
 Schematic located under the Subject column.  Please open the document.  If
 you do not have access to EMBANET you will need to speak with David Kilgore

 
 Thanks,
 Kathy
