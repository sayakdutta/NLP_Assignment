 Thanks alot.  I would love to use them if at all possible.  So for the late response, I was out of the office yesterday.
 
 
  
     
 We decided last night not to go to the Colorado game next week.  I've got two at face if you're interested.  Tough one last weekend.  It sure sucks that OU got that good that fast.  I'm out tomorrow, back on Monday.  See ya.
