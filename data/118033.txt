 
 I think it's a nice idea.

 Can we send Stephanie, Susan and Tana each some flowers on Friday (Panus will 
 be back) as a thank you for the extra work they are doing (and will do) in 
 Samantha's absence?  I think it would be a moral booster and a good way to 
 say thanks.  If yes, can Holly coordinate?
 
 Thanks.
 
 Holly, please touch base with me if Mark approves before you arrange the 
 flowers.
 
 
 Cordially,
