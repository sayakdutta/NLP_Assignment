 
 Sweetie, what happened?  How'd you hurt your back?  So sorry.  And SO sorry that this isn't working out for anyone.  I really wanted to see you guys and REALLY wanted to ride.  Another day, I guess.  Take care of that back.  Herniated disks are bad, so take care.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Hey gang-
 Just back from the doctors and he said "do not go riding this weekend".
 I am terribly disappointed but it wouldn't be wise. I don't have any
 broken bones and it doesn't appear that I have a herniated disk--at this
 point just a lumbar strain but he is afraid it will get worse if I ride.
 I am sorry for the inconvenience and I will send Lari a separate email.
 I hope the trip is wonderful. Please share the details.

 Hi all,
 
 Sorry that some of you won't be making it to Mendocino.  I talked to
 Lari's
 assistant Cynthia and they are not planning to exact cancellation
 charges.
 Cal and I are still planning an all-day ride on Saturday, and Pat and
 Nora
 will be joining us on Sunday for a four-hour beach ride.  Would love for
 any
 of you who are "on the fence" to join us for both days.  The Ranch would
 like to know by Wednesday if possible.

 Dear folks:
 Hope all finds you well, given the circumstances.  I would very much
 like to go, but I continue to be embroiled in the energy mess and school
 has started (last year!).  Turns out I'm going to have to be in Southern
 California that Friday and part of Saturday for work.  I'm going to have
 to cancel.  If there are any charges, please let me know.  Hope to see
 all of you very soon.  Be safe.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 that's really too bad, i hope you are still able to make it.  I am still
 planning to go, but will definitely be riding only on Sunday and might
 drive
 up on Saturday instead of on Friday.  Lu, I'll call you after I talk to
 Jeff
 to confirm whether he's still going.

 Hey guys--
 It is my hope that you and your loved ones have not been directly
 affected in the tragedy.
 
 I assume that the trip to Mendocino is still going forward. I am not
 happy to report that my lower back has gotten worse and not better since
 the accident in Hawaii. Sadly, I may have to pass on Mendocino. I will
 find out more this upcoming week and let you know.
 
 If I do have to cancel I would assume we should keep the Grandma's room
 for Jeff & Lu. If there are any potential cancellation charges I should
 pay to Lari please let me know. I have been looking forward to this for
 so long, I am sad to think of not joining all of you.
 
 I will get back to you by Wednesday.

 Hi Group,
 
 Need input for Lari as our ride approaches (Pat can you forward to Lu
 and
 ask him to reply to me).
 
 I know some of you have ridden with Lari many times, but her scheduler
 is
 facilitating this process and has asked for some information.  Please
 provide the following and I will batch and send to Lari:
 
 
 Years riding
 How often currently riding
 type of riding (i.e. English lessons, dressage, trail)
 type of saddle preferred
 age, height and weight
 
 
 Also, we initially planned on an all-day ride on Sat, and a four-hour
 ride
 on Sunday so we could all head back relatively early.  Lari would like
 to
 know where we want to ride on each day.  Nora is only riding for the
 four-hour ride, and prefers the beach.  How about an all-day ride in the
 redwoods on Saturday, with a four-hour beach ride on Sunday?
 
 
 Amy
