 Received a phone call on Thursday, December 13th approx. 9:15am from Royal =
 Edmondson, Gas Control Manager for Reliant Entex.  He was trying to locate =
 Victoria Versen and was eventually  transferred to me.  He wanted to make s=
 ure Enron was delivering gas to the Entex's city gates.  He asked if  Enron=
  was currently nominating gas to Entex city gates? What about storage?   I =
 told him currently we were not nominating all the gas however; the city gat=
 es were kept whole with the no notice storage K#2210.  He was told by Tenne=
 ssee the storage was not being nominated & there was a good possibility tha=
 t the city gates were not receiving their gas.  I reassured him the city ga=
 tes were receiving their gas.  ENA does not nominate storage, it  was autom=
 atically done at the pipeline level due to the 2 day allocation lag.    As =
 per his previous conversation with Vicki Versen, he has an estimate what th=
 e storage levels were &  wanted to make sure there was enough gas in the st=
 orage to cover December.  I told him he would need to speak with Vicki on t=
 hat matter.  I asked him if there was a problem  that needed to be resolved=
  & his response: Reliant is going to wait it through to see the outcome wit=
 h Enron, but wanted to make sure the gas was being delivered. =20
 
 After the conversation, I run the storage report for December & the gas is =
 automatically being withdrawn.  I called Royal back  and confirmed gas was =
 being withdrawn from storage. He asked for a copy of the storage report.  I=
  did not discuss volume or what Enron's intention were at this time. I have=
  not  fax him a copy of the storage report as per his request.  =20
 
 I did not want to alienate Royal, but at same time I did not want to provid=
 e too much information without knowing his full intentions.
