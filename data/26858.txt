 not.  If it does not work, I can put the demand on the sale ticket.

 Can you make it negative?  We need to reduce our payment.

 I finally heard back from Duke regarding Sept 2000.  They agree with our 
 spreadsheet, so I need a demand fee to adjust the price in Sitara.
 
 Deal 157288 - demand fee of ($8,745.69)
 
 Thanks,
