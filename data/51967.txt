 If you are not already members, and are interested, you can get bonus points 
 and miles by enrolling for Hilton Honors online at www.hiltonhhonors.com.  
 They also have special hotel rates for London much cheaper than Enron's 
 negotiated rates (I just checked with the travel agent).
 I am booked on Continental, leaving next Monday evening, and returning Friday 
 (waitlisted).
