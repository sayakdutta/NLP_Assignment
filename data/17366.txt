 Joseph,
 
 Per our telephone conversation, attached is the draft program for the 
 activities scheduled for our client's Grand Opening which will be attended by 
 Governor Gray Davis and other Government VIP's.  As I told you, my company, 
 The Bentley Company (Architecture/Engineering/Construction company within 
 EES), was responsible for a prominent part of this facility's construction 
 (involving the conversion of a large Boeing factory that SR Technics acquired 
 with much involvement from the Governor's office) and Enron/Bentley will be 
 part of the Grand Opening through possible sponsorship of some event(s), full 
 page ad in the souvenir program, Enron name brand recognition through 
 banners, etc.  I am working out the details of our involvement with the event 
 coordinator right now.  I suspect Enron governmental affairs would like 
 involvement given the relatively high exposure this event will garner 
 politically and through the news media (please refer to the attachment).
 
 Please contact me ASAP at 661-609-4886 to discuss.
 
 Regards,
 
 Ed Ghalib, S.E.
 Director, Client Management
