 > North American Energy and Developing Products Committee
 >
 > The Committee plans to meet within the month to discuss various issues
 > impacting the OTC energy and developing products markets.  Given the
 > increased and varied growth of  ISDA's energy membership, a primary focus
 > will include discussion on updating and reconciling provisions of master
 > agreements for various energy products.  Market and regulatory issues will
 > also be considered.
