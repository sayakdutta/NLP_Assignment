 was no answer, so I figured you didn't want to go.

 Hey, I totally forgot about last night (Sunday).  I was having my car washed
 about the time I should have been thinking about getting ready.  Please
 forgive me for I know it would have been a nice "do" to attend.  Did
 Michelle and you have a nice time?
 
 Thanks for going with me on Friday night.
 
 Talk to you soon.

 Are you there.  I tried calling and no one picked up.  I'm ready to go...

 O.K.
 
 
 
     
 
 
 So far, I can probably leave on time today, which would be about 5:30 pm.
 Let's just check again as the end of the day gets closer.  I think it would
 be a good idea to meet there, since we're coming from opposite directions.
 Dinner sounds good to me....

 Tana,
 
 If you are still interested in doing the Williams Collection do, what would
 be a good time for you to go.  We can meet there and then go to dinner.
 Or,
 you could come by my place and get a look again and help me pick out the
 right furniture.  Whatever is convenient for you, please let me know.
