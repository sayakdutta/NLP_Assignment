 
 Note size of folks participanting as reflected in email distribution list.  
 See attachment, which shows "official" list of coalition members and bullet 
 points they're passing along to legislators.  Note UC is on the list.
 
 Mike:  UC's participation in this coalition can be fairly characterized as 
 "very active."
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Jeff,
 
 Per your voice mail, here are the e-mail addresses for the direct access
 coalition, along with the latest letter of support.  The letter does not
 include Calpine so I told Edelman to take care of it.

 Hello--
 
 I neglected to attach the Direct Access Coalition fact sheet on SB 27x to
 the media plan I sent out last night.  The document I sent out instead was a
 fact sheet created specifically for AReM, so please feel free to disregard
 it.  The attached fact sheet will  need to be updated when the Bowen
 language is released but remains useful at this time.
