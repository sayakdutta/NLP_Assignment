 Notice No. 01-10
 January 8, 2001
 
 TO:        ALL NYMEX MEMBERS AND MEMBER FIRMS
 ALL NYMEX CLEARING FIRMS
 ALL NYMEX OPERATIONS MANAGERS
 
 FROM:     Neal Wolkoff
           Executive Vice President
 
 SUBJECT:     MARGIN RATE CHANGE FOR BACK MONTH CONTRACTS
 
 Effective  
 Futures Contract:  Henry Hub Natural Gas.
 
 Contract Months: April 2001 and all Subsequent Contract Months.
 
 Rate Change:
 
 NYMEX Division Margins for the April 2001 Contract and all Subsequent
 Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures Contracts
 
 Effective  
 Clearing Member (Maintenance Margin):            Old:  $7,000  New:  $5,000
 
 Member Customer (Initial Margin):                Old:  $7,700  New:  $5,500
 
 Non-Member Customer (Initial Margin):            Old:  $9,450  New:  $6,750
 
 Current systems calculate the margin requirement for spread positions by 
 first determining the "Scan Risk" and then multiplying the number of spreads 
 by a rate set by the Exchange.  Scan Risk is determined by netting the 
 outright margin required for each leg of a spread.
 
 Because there is a difference between the outright margin required for the 
 February 2001 and March 2001 delivery months and other months, each spread 
 which includes one leg in either the February 2001or March 2001 delivery 
 months will have its requirement (at the clearing member rates) calculated at 
 $11,500 starting on Monday, January 8, 2001.  This figure is determined as 
 follows:
 
 Example at Clearing Member Rates
 
 One Long February 2001 or March 2001 NG    (1 x $14,000)   =        $14,000
 One Short April 2001 - January 2004 NG       (1 x $5,000)    =   -     $  
 5,000
 Net Scan Risk                         ($14,000-$5,000) =        $  9,000
 Spread Rate                          (1x $2,500)     =   +     $  2,500
 Total Requirement                                 =        $11,500
