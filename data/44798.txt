 
 I would like to take the following time off:
 
 Wednesday, May 31 - I need to leave at 3:00
 
 My new house closing is on Monday June 5 at Partner's Title in the old Texas 
 Commerce Bank Bldg.- they haven't set the time yet
 I will be taking two days off in June to move into my new house - June 12 & 13
 
 My old house sale closes on Monday, June 19 - also at Partner's Title - they 
 haven't set the time yet
 
 Let me know if there are any problems...
