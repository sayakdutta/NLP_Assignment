 Dear Phillip Allen and Matthew Lenhart:
 
 As you know, I am Matthew Lenhart's PRC representative. As such, I would
 like to meet with each of you (separately or together) to discuss the year
 end PRC process, and Matthew Lenhart's activities during the second half of
 the year. It is extremely important that we meet prior to year end so that
 I can make sure I can adequately represent  your interests in the PRC.
 Therefore, at your convenience, please contact my assistant, Shelby
 Malkemes (x3-9842) to set up a time for us to get together. My guess is
 that 45 minutes is probably sufficient, and we can arrange a follow up if
 needed.
 
 If you need to contact me directly before our meeting, I can be reached at
 x3-6173.
 
 Regards,
 
 Ben
