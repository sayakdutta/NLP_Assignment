 Marvin and Bob,
 
 Attached is the most recent version of the LOI.  This version includes 
 revisions resulting from conversations between David Hunt and Kay Mann.  The 
 Beck comments are also included.  
 
 David Fairley and I will call to follow-up.  In the meantime, feel free to 
 call with any questions.
 
 Thank you,
