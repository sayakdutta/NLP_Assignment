 mirror any changes to our Guaranty Forms.  If you make any please remember to 
 let Genia know.  Thanks!

 Tana,
 
 Elizabeth is interested in keeping the Enron Corp. Guarantee Agreement 
 embedded in our EEI Agreement as close to the one you guys use in the Swap 
 Group as possible.  Are you the one in the group that keeps up with any 
 changes made to yours and do you also spearhead getting Clement's blessing?  
 We noticed a couple differences in the one attached below from ours and was 
 wondering when this form was last changed and any reasoning on why it was 
 changed.  Also, how can I be notified when there is a change to your form?  I 
 would be glad to copy you also on any changes we make to our form.  Please 
 advise if you are not the right contact and if you are, let's discuss.
 
 Thanks,
 Genia

 Just to be sure we are working with the "latest form" of Enron guaranty, 
 could you get from Tana the most current swap one and the check it agaianst 
 the one we use for EEI - I would think they should be the same;  if not, lets 
 discuss. Thanks
