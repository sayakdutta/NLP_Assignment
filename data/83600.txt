 Thank you so much for your time last week.
 
 David and I found the time especially valuable. We have spotted several 
 issues helpful for our own market.
 This should certainly help in the growth of our markets here in Europe. We 
 trust it won't be too long before we see similarly impressive results from 
 our side of the pond.
 
 Best regards 
 
 
 Andy
