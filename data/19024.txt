 Jim Steffes suggested that we develop message points in anticipation of 
 FERC's ruling on November 1.  
 
 In this regard, we could:  (1) use the Seabron Adamson paper as our central 
 message; and (2)develop separate messages for a variety of FERC 
 outcomes--e.g., cost-based rates or additional rate caps.  
 
 To that end, we are scheduling a conference call at 11:00 A.M. (PST) this 
 Friday, October 27.  
 
 
 Lysa:  please contact folks on the above-list to see if they are available.  
 Assuming we can reach critical mass for the call, forward AT&T conference 
 calling information to the above-list.
