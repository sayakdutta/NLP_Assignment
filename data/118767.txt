 I have reviewed the long descriptions I was given for the credit derivatives 
 (I can't tell if they are current) and have substantial comments - I have 
 attached what I have come up with (sorry it's in 2 pieces).  Basically I 
 don't think we should be restating something in the Long Description that is 
 already covered (sometimes with different language) in the GTC - this only 
 creates an ambiguity and is not necessary to form a complete contract.  My 
 other concern - and I have not been able to draft language to fix it - is 
 that I can't find any definition of the Seller Payment amount and I don't 
 think the Buyer Payment language works  -  can you give me a call so we can 
 discuss my concerns?
