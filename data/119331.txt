 
 Paul,
 
 Can we get a breakdown of how much Enron gives to soccer and what does it pay for?  
 
 
  
     
 A proposal has been brought forward regarding next season:
 Do we want to have 3 refs at the game (ie, a referee and 2 linesmen)?
 The cost would increase from $20 a game to $60ish a game.
 
 Some teams have suggested that this is not necessary as this is in fact a recreational league.  I tend to agree.
 
 Let me know your thoughts, and I will pass them on to the league.
