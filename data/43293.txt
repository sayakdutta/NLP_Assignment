 I know you are getting a lot of emails right now.  I will keep this short.  Directors under Steve Hotte believe with what is going on with Enron it would make good business since to keep Steve as our leader in ETS-IT.  
 
 ETS-IT staff working very hard to make our goals and objectives for the year, but there is this outside pressure with all of the changes coming down the pipe.  I think we need to keep our strong leadership in tact until we weather the storm.
 
 
 Thanks for having time to read this...
