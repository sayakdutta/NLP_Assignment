 
 This is from Mark Taylor's presentation he gave for Mark Haedicke at the ISDA 
 Energy Seminar in Houston earlier this year.  I know Elizabeth Sager did a 
 presentation last month for Mark H. he gave to some power group in D.C.  
 Also, Mark T. is currently working on one for bandwith trading for Tom Gros.
