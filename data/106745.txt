 think the CP really wants to develop a long term relationship with Enron and 
 will overcome the problem.  Also, CP is interested in eliminating a Credit 
 Support Annex and will call Tanya (or already has called her).  Call me and 
 I'll give you the scoop.  Sara
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
    
 Sara,
 
 How did the McD's discussion go??  Is there anything that I need to do??
 
 Thanks.
