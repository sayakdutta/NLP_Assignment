 Susan,
 
 I would like to request 1 final change to the interconnect agreement before
 execution.  It is a simple change to better clarify the intent of paragraph
 3.4
 
 This is how I would like to see it read,
 
 3.4 For a period of two (2) years from the date of the Facilities are
 completed and placed in-service, EPFS shall be obligated to
  deliver an average of  12,500 MMBtu/d to TW at the Interconnect
 Point.  At the completion of the second year from the date
  the facilities are completed and placed in service, If EPFS has not
 met the 9.1 Bcf volume  commitment, EPFS will refund
  $100,000 to TW within thirty (30) days.  At any time during the two
 (2) year period should EPFS's cumulative delivery to TW
  at the Inteconnect Point meet or exceed the 9.1 Bcf commitment, EPFS
 is relieved  of its volumetric and monetary obligation
  to TW as described in this paragragh 3.4.  .......  rest as
 originally writen...
 
 
 Please let me know what you think.
 
 Darin
