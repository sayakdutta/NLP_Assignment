 I made a mistake - forgot to send it to Lee.  I'm so sorry!  Do you have it 
 and I can send it to him or will he be here in person.  I didn't write it 
 down and it completely slipped my mind.  I really am terribly sorry.

 Hi there,
 
 Lee doesn't remember getting a fax from me yesterday.  Did you get a 
 confirmation back?  It was the same fax that was sent to Pete Thompson.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
