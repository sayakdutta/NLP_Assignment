 Of course we support Bill.  We'd be willing to put a sign in our yard.

 Steve:
 Just wanted to let you know that Bill is running for an open position on the 
 Cy-Fair School Board.  The election is Saturday May 6th at Emmott but early 
 voting takes place tomorrow from 8-12 at the instructional Support Building 
 on Jones Road.   If you and Julie are planning on voting and are undecided, I 
 hope to solicit your support.  His opponent is Don Ryan.
