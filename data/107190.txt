 Not from the credit side as all financial exposure is netted together for our queries.  The details can be found by tracing the exposure through TAGG, ERMS or Enpower to the deal level detail.

 Any way to break this out by commodity, with a summary column?

 All,
 
 Attached is the 11/30/01 file which is probably the best information we have.  I have screened it so that it only includes those counterparties with financial mark to market exposure.  Additionally, I screened out all Enron entities except for ENA, ECC, and EPMI.  While I cannot guaranty that the data is completely accurate, it should give you the starting point you need to proceed with processing/prioritizing financial terminations.  Obviously, the values will be different from what is specified here based on the Termination Date specified by each counterparty.
 
 Thanks,
 Tanya
