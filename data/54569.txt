 I agree. Let them make up the data. Please, ask Shirley to determine 
 convenient date and time.

 Hi all,
 I got the following reply from Mike Denton. 
 
 Can you let me know what time is most convenient for you so I will
 arrange a time for the presentation?
 
  I don't think we should provide them any data, unless you think otherwise.

 Mr. Huang,
 
 We would be happy to demonstrate the features and functionality of the
 WeatherDelta tool set for your team at Enron.  Early next week (Tuesday or
 Wednesday) are both possible, as well as early the following week.  The
 demonstration can take 90 minutes or more, depending on the number of
 questions and the level of detail.
 
 Ideally, you could provide us with some of your data and we could
 demonstrate how to value a full-requirements contract to service that
 particular load.  To do this we will need one or more years of hourly
 consumption data, and the general location of the load.  Ideal data formats
 are csv files of either 365 rows x 25 columns (date,hr1,hr2..) or 8760 rows
 x 3 columns (date,hr,load).  In lieu of using your data, we will provide
 sample load data.
 
 Please feel free to call me and we can discuss schedules and the particulars
 of the product overview and demonstration.
 
 Thank you for your interest,
 
 Michael J. Denton
