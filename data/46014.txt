 never have any coordinated gatherings.  This may be a first!
 
 How are you?   Did you have a good time on your Miami vacation?

 Hey Tana,
 
 
 I was wondering if legal specialists typically have any specific seminars or 
 yearly gatherings (other than this one).  Thanks.
 
 
 Regards,

 SENT ON BEHALF OF BRITT DAVIS:
 
  This is to invite you to the annual Litigation Unit In-house Ethics CLE 
 Seminar, which we have scheduled for Thursday, November 9, 2000, at the 
 Doubletree Hotel at Allen Center.  As in the past, we are proud to present as 
 our speaker Prof. John Dzienkowski of the University of Texas School of Law.  
 An open bar will be available from 4:30-5:00 p.m.; the presentation will take 
 place from 5:00-6:00 p.m.; and there will be a post-presentation open bar 
 (with plenty of boiled shrimp and other finger food) available from 6:00-7:00 
 p.m.  We anticipate obtaining one hour ethic's credit from the Texas Bar for 
 this presentation.  We will be videotaping it for the use of those who 
 schedules do not permit them to attend.  As always, this is at no cost to 
 you.
 
  If you plan to attend, please RSVP to Deborah Shahmoradi by e-mail as soon 
 as you can.  
 
  We look forward to seeing you there!
 
 
 Britt K. Davis
 Enron Litigation Unit
