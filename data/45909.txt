 Tom Moran has approved customer profiles to be the same as US Propane Phy Fwd 
 for the physical products and US Propane Fin Swap for the financial product.  
 
 Please let me know if you agree.
 
 Thanks.

 Shall we copy customer profiles from 1) US Propane FOB Phy Fwd, or 2) US 
 PurityEthane Phy Fwd for the physical products and 1) US Propane Fin Swap or 
 2) US PurityEthane Phy Fwd for the financial product.
 
 As ususal, we have a quick turnaround on these.  And I have 2 more on the way.
 
 Thanks!  Lisa
