 I spoke with Serena and told her how to roll scheduling forward.
 
 Let me know if that doesn't do it.

 Cara,
 
 I need to talk to you about Jan, it looks like nothing has been auto scheduled.  Serena is going to start doing the California deals.  It looks like from the 1/2 on nothing is in actuals.
 
 Thanks
