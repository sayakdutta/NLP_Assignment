 Good morning, 
 
 Hope you had a great Easter weekend. 
 
 Attached are two (2) word files for your review.  First, there is the latest  
 draft of the Sales Proposal which reflects the best efforts and intra day  
 provisions.  Second, there is the Alternate Nominations provisions.  I spoke  
 with PPL this morning and said that I would try to get both of these  
 documents to them today.  Your timely review and comments are greatly  
 appreciated. 
 
 The Alternate Nominations language is being separately provided at the  
 request of PPL so that they can review it.  If they would like to have it  
 incorporated, it can easily incorporated into the proposal and/or agreement. 
 
 Chris, I used the working draft of the Enron/Citizens agreement from our  
 meeting last Monday in Houston to draft the Alternate Nominations language.   
 That draft did not provide for a price differentiation for nominations  
 between 8:30 and 9:00 am CPT.  Should there be one? 
 
 Best regard, 
 
 John
