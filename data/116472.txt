 Thanks!  Stewart had already called me this morning about this deal and had 
 someone in risk change the other two legs.

 It looks like only leg 4 had firm energy - I changed that to CAISO. Legs 2 
 and 3 already had CAISO energy, and leg 1 is killed. Is that okay?

 These two legs are entered with NP-15 delivery points with firm energy.  Let 
 me know if this is correct.
 
 Thanks!
