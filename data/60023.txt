 
 Unfortunately - these guys did not make the cut this week-end.  Jeanie, can you please ensure this is dealt with.
 
  
     
 
 
 Louise:
 This is their headcount estimate.  Initially, the risk and logistics responsibilities can be shared by 1 person.  
 
 It is my understanding that they run on the same ERMS/TAG systems.  They still run their phys on TAG rather than SITARA which I think could continue. 
 
  
     
 John,
 
 
 This is our estimate of the support staff requirements for the NGL business.
 
 Risk Book:	1 full time
 Logistics:	1 full time
 
 Legal:		shared personel,  I dont see the need for a full time legal person dedicated to NGLs
 
 Credit:		1 full time (at least initially), as we ramp up the business we will need a lot of credit support getting counterparties set up and approved.
