 
 P.S. I changed this deal to FPL.
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
   
  
 Can you check with the trader on this deal.  We have had to change several 
 deals input with this CP name.  I believe it should be FPL Energy Power Mktg. 
 not  Florida Power & Light Company.  I think one is a utility which would be 
 local and one is a marketer, who can trade anywhere.
 
 Thanks!
