 Sorry about taking so long to get back to you on this.  Re:  sample master 
 agreements...we recently had a group meeting where we were discouraged to 
 send out sample masters.  What appears to be happening is that a customer 
 gets a sample master w/no credit, and then when we finally send them a real 
 master w/credit, they are somewhat hacked off because the end up being 
 incredibly longer once credit is added.
 
 If possible, can we not talk to Credit about sending them a real master?  Let 
 me know your thinking...

 Tana, would you please e-mail a sample ISDA to Mr. Ray Cunningham of Exxon 
 and let me know when you've done so.   Thanks again !!    John
