 Please refer to Janelle's request for a draft confirm.  The  counterparty's 
 draft has a floating price reference and you should verify with Janelle.  Use 
 the ISDA format; the counterparty is the "Power Authority for the State of 
 New York".  Ignore the "junk" in the counterparty's form.  I have no other 
 info about the particular deal.  Call if you have any questions and please 
 send me a copy.  SS

 Rather than a "redline" of their confirmation, maybe its better if we just 
 send our confirmation, and see if that would be acceptable.  Can you either 
 email me the appropriate draft to distribute to them or have it distributed 
 directly? Thanks.

 Hi, Janelle - Per our conversation this morning, the appropriate contact
 would be Jackie Kmiotek-Welsh in our Legal Dept.  You can e-mail her the
 agreement with the desired changes (redline) to her. If you could cc Terryl,
 Leon, and myself on the e-mail, that would be great.
 
 Jackie's telephone number is (914)390-8019.  Any questions, please contact
 us.
