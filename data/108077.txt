 Would like to talk again this week - I plan to get to Houston/London in the 
 beginning of January and want to consider a path to start thinking on now - 
 if I do make a change (or it is forced on me).
 
 By the bye, a former analyst of mine says that you all might enter the 
 fertilizer business...I tried to get Houston to enter it a year and a half 
 ago - we ran the correlations and had a global market study done (Chem 
 Systems - An IBM company).  The corr that Grant ran between ammonia/urea to 
 corn was high (like above 92% if I recall)...we looked at investing in a 
 plant here in Argentina (obviously significant supply/demand mix of 
 agriculture and fert products in Arg/Brazil) at that time and were analyzing 
 a potential hedge - I killed it because it was not competitive let alone the 
 lack of interest in Houston...The market is on the way up...as long as you 
 stick to the base products - pure fert futures never made a go from what I 
 was told...take care...
 
 Please let me know when you are available...
 
 Thanks,
 jf
