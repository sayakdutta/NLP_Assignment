 
 I'll be looking forward to receiving that report and thank you for the update.

 Don't think of it as "dropped."  This is a new six weeks.  Remember, I don't have a lot of grades at this point, so any zeros really bring down their grades.  Once she turns in her work, it will com up.  You will be getting a detailed report on Friday.
 

 So you are telling me that her grade has dropped from 91 to 65?  Is this
 due that paper not being turned in?
 
 
     
 
 She currently has a 65.  I need her timeline paper and her "7th grade"
 questions.  Thanks!
 

 
 
 Good Morning Mrs. Kobernick -
 
 Just checking with you to see how Candis' day was today.  What is her
 grade in your class as of today and did she ever turn that paper in that
 she missed that day?  Thanks for keeping me informed.
