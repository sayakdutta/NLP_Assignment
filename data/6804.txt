 talking for me on Saturday.
 
 By the way,  you can probably see your reflection in that surfboard by now.

 Bass, give it up.  You are done.
 
 The Tigers wear the mantle of favorite well. They have won
                     nine straight games in postseason play, including the 
 Southeastern
                     Conference tournament. They are relatively healthy. They 
 have power
                     hitters, they have patient hitters, and they can field 
 better than recent
                     versions of the club. Best of all, they have a lot of 
 arms, and they have
                     Bertman around to use them.
