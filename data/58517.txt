 Network television is developing a "Texas Version" of "Survivor", the
 popular TV show...
 
 Contestants must travel from Amarillo through Fort Worth, Dallas, Houston,
 San Antonio, and back to Amarillo, through San Marcos and Lubbock... driving
 a Volvo with a bumper sticker that reads:
 
 "I'm for Gore, I'm Gay and I'm Here to Take Your Guns".
 
 The first to complete the round trip is the winner.
