 Two suggestions:  I think the word "forgoing" should be "foregoing", and I
 do not see the need for us to say what the Chinese Government decided, as

 Rosie,
 
 On September 25, 2000 the Tibetan Government-in-exile wrote Dr. Lay at the
 Beijing office address requesting that Enron cancel its participation in
 the Sebei-Lanzhou pipeline.   We faxed a copy of this communication to you
 a few minutes ago.  We have drafted the attached proposed response.
 Rebecca McDonald concurs with the approach in this letter, which has been
 reviewed by the addressees of this message.  Your assistance in
 appropriately formatting and printing the letter for signature would be
 appreciated.  Please let me know if you have any questions or need
 assistance.
 
 Thanks,
 
 John
