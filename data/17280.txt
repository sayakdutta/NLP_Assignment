 Greetings:
 Attached please find the new draft of the "Seeing the Light".  You can see
 that some holes remain to be filled in - particularly in the solutions
 section at the end and we will be using the solutions we came up with at the
 last in-person meeting as the foundation.  In light of recent activities it
 may also be wise to add an Operations and Maintenance section with
 comparisons as to how facilities were operated in the past and how they are
 operated now.
 
 On the production side, the graphs etc. have not been replicated yet and
 McNally Temple will use the new data from MRW to make adjustments.
 
 As always we invite comments and suggestions on this as well as any
 suggested additions.  Please review this document this week and give me any
 initial comments as soon as possible.  I would like the first round of
 comments by COB on Thursday so we can turn it around for another review.
 Thank you for taking the time to review this and as always please let me
 know if you have any questions.
 
 Thanks!
