 something last week was because I got a settlement on my some of my dads 
 insurance shit and I wanted to go out to a nice dinner.  I thought it would 
 be a nice opportunity for us to hang out and catch up.  I hope you don't 
 still think that I didn't want to see you that night because you are dating 
 dave, I just had to run some errands right when you called back.
