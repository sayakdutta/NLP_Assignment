 This is sumas.   Also, you are correct, that all you need to do, is add this value to the others (nymex + basis + index).  Let me know if you need anything else.

 Matt,
 Thank you for the codes!  What are the correct calculations for the heatrates?  When determining the gas price, do I take the prices that I've been using and add the index value using the codes that you sent me?  Do you know the code for Sumas?  
 Thanks,
 Maria

 Maria,
 
 I don't remember exactly which locations you need the index curves for, but these should give you a start.  Let me know which ones, I've left out from your list.
