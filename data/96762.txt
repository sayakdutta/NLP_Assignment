 Enclosed is are my suggested modifications to the TVA Letter Draft we 
 discussed yesterday.   I will prepare the one-line diagram and the project 
 description (including the breaker interlock scheme) by the end of the day 
 and forward them to you.  Please call me at x57793 if you have questions.
