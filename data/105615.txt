 I know that Tana has already answered your immediate question.
 I am responding because Enron Corp. is also asking for an ISDA.  I am the 
 Enron Corp. lawyer.  Can you also send a draft master to me?
 Thanks.  Sara

 Hi Sara/Tana--
 
 I've been told to get started on Enron Capital & Trade Resources 
 International Corp. ISDA.  Is this handled out of Houston or in UK (or 
 otherwise)?
 
 Thanks and regards,
 
 Steve
