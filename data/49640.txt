 
 John,
 
 Congratulations on a career move.
 
 Yes, we were contacted regarding geophysical data gathering/transmission 
 project.
 We asked our geophysicists for help and are shooting for
 a meeting on  Thursday to run our ideas by them.

 Good Morning Vince:
 
 1) We met with some geophysical data gathering/transmission people last 
 week.  I observed that there is an opportunity to get in the early steps of 
 the (oil exploration) energy supply chain - we can get at the key data 
 driving oil drilling earlier than anyone else by extending into this area of 
 broadband networking - to build a way to hedge oil and other energy trades.  
 
 I asked Adler or Reichardt to present the idea to your team for validation.  
 Have they contacted you yet?
 
 2) I'm converting to consultant - I've had a great year here but need to get 
 back north more often (family).  I will be converting to consultant status 
 starting next week.  Do not hesitate to call me if there is anything I can do 
 for you or your team to help out.
