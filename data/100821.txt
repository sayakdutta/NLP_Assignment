 
 Dear Citizens' Assistance Division:
 
 I live in the Houston Heights on the 800 block of Cortlandt.  For the 3 years 
 I've lived 
 there, the drainage ditch in front of my house, and several other houses on 
 my street, 
 have been blocked.  Any time it rains, we have standing water for several 
 days 
 afterwards.  I know that other streets in the Heights have the same problem.  
 I have 
 heard that because of the mild winter we're having, we can expect a bumper 
 crop of 
 mosquitos this summer.  Standing water therefore poses a health concern for 
 residents 
 of the Heights this summer. 
 
 Does the City have any current plans to fix the drainage problem in the 
 Heights?  Last 
 year I called and requested that the ditch in front of my house be cleared, 
 but got no 
 response.  I hope that this was merely an oversight rather than an indication 
 that the City 
 of Houston has no regard for the health and comfort of its citizens. 
 
 Any information you can provide would be appreciated. 
 
 Sincerely, 
 
 Susan Scott 
 815 Cortlandt St.
