 etc , including vacation time.  It called for a password.  Did you receive a 
 password for yours?  I wonder if it is the same as the password when you 
 submit benefits.  Any ideas?

 Becky, could you run a time off report so Kay can see how much vacation time 
 she has left.  I don't believe I can do that for her.  You can just send it 
 to me, or whatever is easier.  Thanks, Suz
