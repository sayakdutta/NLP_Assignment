 How's it going?
 
 Any more thoughts on tomorrow night?  We could ask your mother to sit for a 
 little while.  I think it is pretty neat to get invited to the Enron one.
 
 The head of the power trading legal group stopped by and said to let her know 
 if I ever want to change groups.  I thought that was nice.
 
 I'm contemplating doing something special with Michael over spring break.  I 
 figure you guys have lots of "guy only" stuff coming up, but there aren't a 
 lot of "mom/son" opportunities.  (be realistic)  Maybe we should take a 
 Disney cruise, since that's something you wouldn't like to do.
 
 Love,
