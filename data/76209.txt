 So what do you think the News will make out of this?
 
 I guess you decided to skip the game...I'll call Paige and I will pick up
 Michael since she's taking him to Sharon's tomorrow. NM

 FYI - My daughter just called to tell me that their seismic company just
 found a body (skeletal remains) on Nolan Ryan's bull ranch China Grove
 (don't know if that is a town or the name of the ranch), off of County Road
 521.  Ryan is just the tenant, the property belongs to Claude Hammel.
