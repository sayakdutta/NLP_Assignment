 
 Thanks Chris.  According to Patti, Williams was doing maintenance to its site and did not come back up.  When, the site becomes available lets plan on rerunning the capture to get the last cycles for the missed days.

 We appeared to have some problems with a couple of web sites on Saturday
 evening / Sunday afternoon.  Unfortunately, I was not home at that time to
 be able to reset them.  Upon returning home this evening (Sunday), I took a
 look and the following cycles did not get scraped:
 
 05/19/2001
 Kern, Cycles 2 & 4
 Transco Cycle 2
 
 05/20/2001
 KM (Points R & D, Segments) Cycle 2
 Transcolorado (R & D, Segments) Cycle 2
 Kern, Cycle 3
 Northwest, Cycle 6
 
 I have reset all of the jobs...unfortunately, I suspect there is data loss
 for the above cycles. One of our "old friends", the 1line Williams site, is
 definately the cause for the Northwest, Kern and Transco misses.  This site
 still appears to be having problems, so it should be checked for the next
 couple of days.  When trying to go to it tonight, I received various errors,
 and the general site layout appeared different since the last time I looked
 (this means they could potentially change the layout of the page we get data
 from as well).
 
 As I write this, "capture" jobs for Kern, Northwest, and Transco are failing
 due to "Internal Server Errors".
 
 Hopefully, this is a short-term problem, and these sites will stabilize
 soon.  The bright side of this story is that the Jaguar system did exactly
 what it was supposed to do when these problems occur...it retried until the
 job attempts seemed fruitless, then it sent pages to report the problems.
