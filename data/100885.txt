 On the Ted front...It's Tuesday afternoon and I haven't contacted him yet.  
 I'm planning on calling him at home early this evening and telling him that 
 "a beer and a chat sound like a good idea, how about tomorrow night?".  I 
 will be requesting that he either call me at home tonight if he gets in early 
 enough or tomorrow at work.  This should all prove very interesting.
