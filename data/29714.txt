 Rob,
 
 Didn't he say we were only covered up to $200 MM (e.g. the limit of our 
 contract frustration cover?) With the current Shell/enron sharing 
 percentages, it would seem that we are entitled to 72% of the $360 MM payment 
 or $259 MM, thus we would only be out by $59 MM.

 According to Cliff Shedd, we would be covered by insurance if we terminated 
 the contract with Furnas and Furnas failed to pay the termination payment.  
 However the insurers will only pay after we receive an arbitration judgement 
 against them and the refuse to honor the judgement.  I assume we would also 
 have to exhaust our remedies against trhe guarantor (Eletrobras).
 
 Also, we are required to notify the underwriters immediately of a material 
 default.
