 with them on it.  I have no problem with the dollar amount.

 Please note the counter settlement offer set forth in the email below by our 
 local counsel in the Gignilliat Charge of Discrimination matter.
 
 I recommend that we settle the matter for $7,500 or a little less if we can 
 get there.
 
 I think it is your Company's money so I will defer to you on this one. 
 
 Please advise.

 Hi Kriste,
 As we discussed, I offered Gignilliat a $5,000 nuisance value settlement.
 Gignilliant's counsel, after consulting with his client, said he would take
 $7,500 to settle the case.  While I think Enron has a very strong defense to
 the disability claim, I am less certain about the aiding and abetting claim.
 As we discussed, the Mass. Commission Against Discrimination allowed
 Gignilliat to amend his charge to add this claim.  Gignilliat may be able to
 create enough of a fact contest about what the plant manager (Dennis
 Sherrin) told ANP  about his disability to at least get past the probable
 cause stage.  While I still think that in the end, Enron has a very good
 chance of prevailing on the aiding and abetting claim, $7,500 is a good,
 final resolution to avoid further litigation.  Let me know what you think.
 Thanks,
