 On April 20, 2001, SCE filed Advice 1534-E-A with the Commission.
 
 Title:
 Establishment of Four New Balancing Accounts and other Tariff Revisions -
 Supplemental Filing
 
 Purpose:
 This advice filing establishes four separate balancing accounts: 1) the SCE
 Utility Retained Generation Balancing Account; 2) the SCE Contracts
 Balancing Account; 3) the Procurement Costs Balancing Account; and 4) the
 Ancillary Services Balancing Account.  In addition, this filing dedicates a
 portion of SCE's residually determined generation rate and
 Commission-approved surcharges between the four balancing accounts based on
 estimated costs for a twelve-month period and establishes the Generation
 Rate Trigger Mechanism. Furthermore, in conjunction with the implementation
 of the four new balancing accounts and the Trigger Mechanism, this filing
 1) modifies the Transition Revenue Account; 2) establishes the Net
 Undercollected Amount Account; (3) eliminates the Transition Cost Balancing
 Account; 4) eliminates the Generation Memorandum Accounts 2 ; and 5)
 eliminates the Emergency Procurement Surcharge Balancing Account.
