 To All -
 
 We have a meeting scheduled for tomorrow at 2:30 in EB38C2.  I am hoping to 
 have a test version of the site available - especially since it is due for 
 release on Friday.  I have not been able to confirm its availability at this 
 time.  If it is not available, there is probably not a reason to meet 
 tomorrow as I am sure we all have other projects.
 
 I will let you all know what the status is by late today or early a.m. 
 tomorrow.
