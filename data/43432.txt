 
 Glad you could make the trip.
 
 
    
  
 Just wanted to say thanks for the opportunity to travel with you to Wiggins 
 compressor station. I will look forward to working with your respective 
 organizations around procurement, contracting and deal issues. I hope our 
 paths will cross again.
 
 regards,
