 Good Morning Honey,
 
 I didn't really sleep well last night, so I am tired and cranky today. However, the feeling of RFP is something to grin about. Today I am tying out our February positions with the traders so that they can pre-pay their trades for scheduling Feb 1.  Just spreadsheet and number crunching stuff.  
 
 You are so important to me, I can't hardly articulate how much you mean to me. I love you and am so proud and happy to be yours. I can't wait till we share a home and I am 'out' to my family.  I want to tell them, "this is done" not "this is what I am going to do".  I love waking up in your arms and feeling your kisses first thing in the morning. The sleep thing will work itself out, I am not worried about it.
 
 I am looking forward to forever with you.
 
 Love,
 
 CF
