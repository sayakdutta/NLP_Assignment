 
 I'm thinking my last email was unclear.  
 
 I assume that someone from the commercial team will send (or has sent) the 
 extension letter to MDEA, YC, and Clarksdale's commercial reps for their 
 review.  I assume that the  commercial reps with YC, MDEA, and Clarksdale 
 will get whatever legal input they want from their own lawyers if they think 
 it is necessary (may not), but as a courtesy, I sent drafts to the two 
 lawyers I know about.
