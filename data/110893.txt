 The Kennedy deal is effective December 1, 2001.  Paul Lucci said we're gonna need to all get together before we enter the deals.  He did not say when that would be.  I would assume this week sometime.
 
 Thanks.
 Theresa
 
 
  
     
 Theresa,
 
 Hope that all is well with you in Denver and that your trip to Houston last week was a pleasant one.  I was out Thurs. and Friday, but Anne was telling me that you guys did a deal with Kennedy Oil.  Do you have the Sitara deal #'s for that deal.  I need to link them up to the Tagg deal. Thanks.
