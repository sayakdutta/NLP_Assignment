 
 Kevin,
 
 Vasant and I talked to Clayton about his request for transfer. Clayton 
 received a conditional approval contingent
 upon completion of the current project he works on. Vasant will formulate 
 exact definition of the deliverables
 and we will hold  Clayton  to it. If he fails to deliver the request for 
 transfer will be rejected. Anything else
 would be highly demoralizing to everybody.
 
 Clayton has so far produced exactly zero (no single output was delivered) 
 though he was advertising
 the projects inside and outside the group as completed. I want you to be 
 aware of it, because I have
 serious doubts regarding Clayton's integrity.
