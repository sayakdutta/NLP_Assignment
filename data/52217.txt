 
 John,
  
 He travels periodically to
 Houston. I may inquire about his next trip.
  
 If you want to speak to him urgently, I can arrange 
 a phone interview or invite him to Houston.

 I would love to talk to him.  Does he live in France.  Is it easier for him to work in London. If not I would be happy to do a phone interview.
  
 Please advise

 John, 
 
 I am not sure if I have already sent you this resume. 
 Please, take a  look at it. I met Claude a few years ago 
 and was greatly impressed by him. He may be a good candidate to 
 work with Andy Zipper.
