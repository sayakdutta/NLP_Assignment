 
 I hope you were only thinking good things!  
 I had a pretty good weekend.  I got to see my extended family in Fairfield.  
 Did you ever meet my cousin Chuck and his wife Shelley?  They have the cutest 
 kids (Becca and Cullen).  So, I spent a lot of time with them.  I had fun at 
 your birthday party!  When do I get to take you to PF's for lunch?
 
 
 
 
 
 

    
 
 Yes I did.  I was just thinking about you.  I'm really glad you showed up.
 I'm also sorry to hear about your grandma.  I will keep her in my prayers.
 I had a fun and relaxing weekend, and I'm really glad you were a part of it
 :-).  Did you have fun?
