 Hi Dutch,
  
 I hated to call you to tell you I still don't have an answer from EDF Man.  I spoke to Paul again about 5 min. ago (1:45) and he tells me that he still can't get an answer but that I'm the first on the list to call!!??  I then called our treasury department and spoke to Nera and she says that the wire has not come in as of yet.
  
 I'll let you know as soon as I do!
