  THE GOLFING NUN
 A nun is sitting with her Mother Superior chatting.
 "I used some horrible language this week and feel absolutely terrible
 about it."
 "When did you use this awful language?" asks the elder.
 "Well, I was golfing and hit an incredible drive that looked like it was
 going to go over 280 yards, but it struck a phone line that was hanging
 over the fairway and fell straight down to the ground after going only
 about 10 yards."
 
 "Is that when you swore?"
 "No, Mother," says the nun. "After that, a squirrel ran out of the
 bushes and grabbed my ball in its mouth and began to run away."
 
 "Is THAT when you swore?" asks the Mother Superior again.
 "Well, no." says the nun. "You see, as the squirrel was running, an
 eagle came down out of the sky, grabbed the squirrel in his talons and
 began to fly away!"
 
 "Is THAT when you swore?" asks the amazed elder nun.
 
 "No, not yet. As the eagle carried the squirrel away in its claws, it
 flew near the green and the squirrel dropped my ball."
 
 "Did you swear THEN?" asked Mother Superior, becoming impatient.
 "No, because the ball fell on a big rock, bounced over the sand trap,
 rolled onto the green, and stopped about six inches from the hole."
 
 The two nuns were silent for a moment. Then Mother Superior sighed ands
 said, "You missed the fucking putt, didn't you?"
