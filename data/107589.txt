 Rick,
 
 I understand that Ken Lay will officially open the Enron Japan office around 
 the 1st of November. We should make sure that our key LNG contacts are 
 invited to the ceremony, especially our joint venture partners in the Lakshmi 
 and the builders of the Lakshmi. Other key companies we should consider would 
 be Osaka Gas, Tokyo Gas, and Mitsubishi.
