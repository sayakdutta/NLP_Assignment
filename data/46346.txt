 Just a reminder that Leslie Hansen's baby shower will be on Wednesday, 
 December 13th, from 12:00-1:00 in EB46C1.  Please let me know if you plan to 
 attend so I can get an accurate count for lunch.
 
 Thank you!
 
 
 P. S.  If you would like to contribute to a group gift certificate, please 
 let me know.
