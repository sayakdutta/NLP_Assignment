  Attached please find the execution copy of the LV Cogen/GE
 Agreement (the second document below), which incorporates the revised
 Retention Letter amounts.  I have also included a blackline (first
 document below) so that you can demonstrate to GE that no other changes
 have been made.  To complete the Agreement, the date of execution must
 be added to the first page and Exhibit H-2 must be inserted manually.  I
 believe that you already have a copy of Exhibit H-2 provided by Lee
 Johnson, but I will forward a copy momentarily.
