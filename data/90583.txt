 
 I've had fried turkey before, it's actually pretty good, however my wife and 
 I are going for the more traditional feast........we have company coming down 
 to visit us in our little apt.........going to be packed in..........things 
 could be worse.......it's 60-65 degrees here for thanksgiving and even jan/ 
 feb only gets down to 50-60 on average......
 
 ok now that I'm calmed down, I feel much better.........you know how it is 
 .........................there's no pressure in these job's !.
