 Chris -
  
 Louise asked for org charts by the end of today.  I don't know if she wanted them to go down to this level, but below is the info for the southeast orig team.  This will cover orig for the SE and portions of the MW.  For now, Dave Duran and I will share coverage of the MW and Larry Valderrama will assist both of us.
  
 Dave Duran is out today, so I've included his info below as well:
  
 SE & MW - Mitch Robinson
 - Abler
 - Hiemstra
 - Valderrama
 - Rorschach
  
 NE & MW - Dave Duran
 - Wood
 - Meyn
 - Llodra
  
 Dave, please let me know if I've missed anyone in your group.
