 Attached are filings made this week at FERC to seek permission for EPMI and 
 EES to make certain FERC-required filings (including quarterly power marketer 
 filings) on behalf of industrials with on site generation that sell power 
 into the grid to us.  The filings will allow Enron to make it easier for 
 these industrials to sell to us from their administrative filing viewpoint.  
 We expect to receive authorization within 60 days.
 
 Generally, industrials with on site generation are required to obtain a FERC 
 power marketer license and comply with FERC's reporting requirements, similar 
 to EPMI and EES' FERC filing requirements.  EPMI and EES will be able to file 
 specific industrial purchases in a combined report, rather than requiring the 
 industrials to file their separate reports with FERC.  
 
 Please contact me if you plan a deal to purchase power from an industrial.  
 We need to consider additional costs/back office transaction flags that may 
 be required in order for us to track these purchases.  Thanks.  Christi  
 37007.
