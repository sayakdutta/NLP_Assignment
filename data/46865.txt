 Participant under the rules of the CFTC.  The CFTC sets financial criteria, 
 such as certain net worth and assets tests for companies to trade financial 
 products .  Sometimes counterparties can still meet the legal criteria, but 
 Credit may not want to do that type of business with them.

 Tana,
 Thanks for the approvals.  One question though.  Credit approved American 
 Color Graphics for physical transactions only.  However,
 your sheet shows them open for financial trading.  Usually, you will close a 
 counterparty for financial
 if Credit does.
