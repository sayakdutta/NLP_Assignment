 
 Happy New Year, Gaylen!
 
 Would you be available on Monday at 11:00am (CST) to discuss?  I am routing the OBA to the key departments for comments.  I should have the language for the IT agreement finalized late today or Monday morning.  I hope to send it to you and we can discuss in our phone call.  
 
 Let me know if this works for you.
 
 Thanks, Kim.
