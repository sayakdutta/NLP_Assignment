 
 In connection with the ISDA negotiations, PG&E is insisting on revising our 
 "Limitation of Liability" language"
 
 "...PROVIDED, HOWEVER,THAT NOTHING IN THIS PROVISION SHALL AFFECT THE 
 ENFORCEABILITY OF SECTION 6(e) OF THIS AGREEMENT with respect to incidental 
 damages."
 
 PG&E claims that it will never be responsible for consequential damages and 
 that certain elements of "Loss" comprise consequential damages (PG&E always 
 agrees to "Market Quotation"). 
 Have you ever prepared a list of the "Loss" components?
 Can you assess before I go to Haedicke (or is this a non-starter)?
 Thanks.  Sara
