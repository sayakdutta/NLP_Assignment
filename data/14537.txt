 Attached is a copy of an outline of the children's Christmas Eve service that 
 I reviewed with Patty last night.  I have delivered a hard copy of the 
 outline and readings to the Church Office.  Sorry to dash off an email 
 without calling everyone -before I leave town.
 
 Nancy - I'm hoping that you are still amenable to playing the piano.  If you 
 have selections that you prefer -- feel free to change my selections.  They 
 were picked only because the kids know these songs.  It is particularly a joy 
 to hear them sing the chorus of "The First Noel."
 
 Barbara Thompson - I was hoping that you could ask the children at children's 
 church whether any of them are interested in volunteering to read for the 
 worship .
 
 Stephanie - I am hoping that you can line up an adult leader willing to play 
 overall MC and to read the Christmas message.  If you find someone- please 
 let Patty know.  Otherwise I think she may be amenable to pinchhit.
 
 Lisa C. - Could you please line up a greeter/door tender for the worship.  
 And, also check with the trustees to make sure the sanctuary is unlocked in 
 time.
 
 
 Thanks everyone.  I just love rattling off email orders!
