 
 The discussions went well on the ECA this morning and there are no issues of 
 any great significance left, other than Shell's sponsor buyout proposal.  We 
 have one turn of the document to do but we are in good shape here (I guess 
 that is to say we are perfectly positioned to offer millions and millions in 
 sponsor support).  I want to take just a little more time on the model to 
 make sure everything we send will tie, but we will get it to them  on  Monday 
 for sure.
