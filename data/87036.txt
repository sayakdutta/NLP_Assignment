 As reported previously in the trade press, Petal Gas Storage has decided to 
 build its own pipeline to connect its storage facility in Forrest Co., MS to 
 interconnections with Southern Natural, Destin, and Transco in Clarke and 
 Jasper Cos., MS.  We have received FERC's notice of the application (Docket 
 No. CP01-69), and will be filing an intervention before the February 20 
 deadline.  Southern Company Services has contracted for the full 700,000 
 Mcf/day of capacity for a term of 20 years.  The project calls for about 59 
 miles of 36-inch pipeline and a 9,000 HP compressor station at a cost of 
 about $94,343,700.
 
 As part of its application, Petal also submitted pro forma tariff provisions 
 and rates for firm and interruptible transportation services and asked for 
 authority to charge negotiated rates.  Petal also requested approval of 
 certain deviations from the pro forma transportation agreement for the 
 contract with Southern, apparently to allow Southern to act as agent for its 
 affiliated operating electric utilities to apportion capacity among them.
 
 Please advise if you have any issues with Petal that should be made a part of 
 our intervention.  The certificate application is 635 pages, not including 
 another 778 pages for the environmental reports, so I'm not going to request 
 a copy unless someone indicates a desire to review it.
