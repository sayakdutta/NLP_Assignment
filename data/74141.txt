 Here's a first ckm draft based on what we had before.  From a substantive 
 standpoint I used fuel cell energy technology as a generic, and not 
 specifically relating it to FCE.  I based this on a very brief discussion I 
 had with Heather, so I hope I didn't misunderstand.
 
 I've incorporated the confidentiality agreement by reference, and included a 
 brief statement that this transaction falls within its purview.  
 
 Please let me know your comments.
