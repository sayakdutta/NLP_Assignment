 The following Message was sent to members of Contract List Server, the EEI 
 Contract Standization Mailing List.
 To All:
 
 We will hold a meeting of the contract working group at EEI's offices on 
 October 9, 2000 from 10am to 4pm.  Lunch will be provided.  We tried to 
 schedule a meeting around Power Markets 2001, but EEI does not have space 
 available for a large group that week.  A detailed agenda will be sent out 
 before the meeting.
 
 If anyone still wants to advise the drafting committee about issues they want 
 to address, please do so.  It would be helpful for the drafting committee to 
 see what customized terms are being added to your cover sheets.  Please 
 forward them to me if you want to help us.  Enjoy the rest of your Summer!
