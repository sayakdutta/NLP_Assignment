 
 Its all coming together now.... I haven't checked my messages yet (I'll do that now just to make sure your telling the truth).  As for the bet, we did bet $20 (your co-worker Mac bet me $50)  
 
 What does BTW mean?  You're a dork.......

 Don't be so touchy!  I was only teasing. BTW, I tried to call you Sunday but you never left me your number. I left you 2 messages at work. Actually it was you who blew me off, thanks a lot. ; )
 
 I'm off to Virginia late this morning so I may not see you. 
 
 You are done on double or nothing, but I thought the bet was $20. I'm just a lowly originator, I can't afford big trader bets!
 
 And my name automatically comes in at the bottom of a message.
