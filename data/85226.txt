 if we don't get the transport for any reason under the terms of the Precedent 
 Agreement.  Counterparty might not go for it, but it would clear this issue 
 up.

 gerald,what do you think "reasonable efforts to acquire" means?  do we have 
 to elect to take transport....at what price........since producer must pay 
 the price under the contract price formula....we may need to be willing to 
 agree on a range of acceptable prices...........this would also help define 
 reasonale efforts...........................your thoughts please   bng
