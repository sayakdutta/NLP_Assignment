 
 What is an Ambassador Doll and where can I buy one?
 
 
     
 
 Thanks so much for lunch yesterday!
 
 I looked up Nancy Kline's info. She is a nurse practitioner who also has a
 Ph.D. -- a real underachiever.
 
 I'm actually working with Mark Kline on their idea for an Ambassador Doll.
 We are trademarking it. 
 
 Have a good day.
