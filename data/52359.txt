 What about a lunch or breakfast on Monday or Tuesday next week?
 I am traveling later this week.

 Vince:   I have returned from SF and look  forward to our next meeting.  I mentioned to Bjorn that we might get  together and hoped we might do a lunch meeting this time.  Bjorn and I  could drop by and pick you up to make it simple.  How about today or  tomorrow?  Please advise.  Al Arfsten 713 965  2158
