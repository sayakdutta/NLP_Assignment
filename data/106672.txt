 he=20
 office and has not returned my telephone calls.  So, we are preparing=20
 execution copies of the ISDA and will have these signed by ENA.  We will fa=
 x=20
 and Federal Express these to EDEN with a cover letter explaining to fax the=
 =20
 signature page back, when they can expect the Enron Corp. guaranty and when=
 =20
 we can expect their opinion of counsel.  I will also explain this to Ana=20
 Sonia by separate fax.  I just spoke with Jeff Kable and explained this to=
 =20
 him.  Susan Bailey is here all day but she is out next week (and I am out=
 =20
 next week as well).  However, Marie Heard will help out next week.  Let me=

 know if you have any questions.  Sara
