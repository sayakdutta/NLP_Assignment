 Your approach makes perfect sense to me, but I think Lee wants his turbine=

 contract sooner.
 
 I still haven't received the finance stuff yet.  I've asked again today.

 Kay:
 
 I have Lee Johnson's address information and will send the Turbine Contract
 now.  (I had been holding this package waiting on signature pages from
 Freshfields on all of the other GE documents that GE provided directly to
 Freshfields, as I was going to include these documents in the GE package as
 well).  =20

 Carolyn,
 
 GE is calling for the original turbine contract.  I believe I previously
 provided Lee Johnson's address.  Could you send him an original?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
