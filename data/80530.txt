 
 Jeff, attached is an expanded 1st draft of the memo.  I would like to keep 
 this expanded format to show the progress that we have made in the group.
 
 Please make any changes and send back for the next round.  After we both look 
 at it 1 more time, we will circulate to the heads of the group for 
 commentary.  I would like to have them feel part of the memo.
 
 Mike
