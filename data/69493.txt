 
 Hello,
 
 Thanks for sending me an email.  I appreciate the interest and found your profile to be interesting as well.  But, I feel I'm at a disadvantage due to the fact that your profile doesn't contain a picture.  Are you sending a picture over later, or making me guess as to what you look like?  Drop me a line and we can hash this out.
 
 Paul

 The following is my profile text:
 
 I never thought I'd be using a "dating service". But I'm open to trying new things - so let's give it a try. I'm an outgoing, positive, fun person. I LOVE to travela nd experince new places and cultures. I'm always learning something new - right now it's the guitar. I'm also really happy being alone with myself to read, write, or just putz around. I love kids, and they love me - probably because I'm pretty much a kid at heart still. I'm very close to my family and have probably too many good friends - I spend a lot of time keeping up with them all.
