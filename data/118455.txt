 As you are aware, we are in the middle of the VP Performance Review Cycle.  
 On instructions from the Office of the Chair,  VP's and above will be 
 measured principally on the Skills/Behaviors criterion.  This will also be 
 supplemented by two additional indicators:
 
 Providing Feedback to Staff
 Participation in Recruiting efforts for Enron programs
 
 Critical to the item "Providing Feedback to Staff" is your involvement in 
 collecting this data.  Attached is a form that should be distributed to all 
 your direct reports regarding this item.  The instructions ask the direct 
 reports to send this information back to me.  I will collate the data and 
 this will be available for use at both the December ENA Executive Review 
 Meeting on December 14, and  the January 5-6 Enron Executive Meeting.  
 
 Again, your involvement in helping me collect this data is critical to the 
 success.  Please contact me at Ext 30649 if you have any further questions.
