 
 Attached AS AN EXAMPLE ONLY is a "Transition Memo" which Marie prepared to 
 capture her current workload.  Could you please utilize that format and 
 prepare a summary of your current workload?  Mark, Carol and I would like to 
 receive your lists as soon as possible, but no later than Thursday evening.  
 Thanks.  Sara
