 Hey Chris,
 
 Sorry about the phone call -- kinda difficult being discreet around here --
 you know!
 
 Yes! I'd definitely like to meet anytime this week.  Lunchtime might be
 kinda rough for
 
 you and me both, eh?  So,....maybe dinner one or more nights this week??
 I'm available
 
 any evening this week.  Just let me know!
 
 

 will
 
 be calling me soon as well.  It appears that they could use a good
 Northeast/CNG
 
 scheduler in the Commodity Risk Management group ASAP.  I applied for the
 position via
 
 Marde and the Job# as is posted on the Enron company job site (online).
 Just reading
 
 over the qualifications and pre-reqs,.....I like the position and feel that
 I could contribute
 
 immediately.
 
  Let's keep in touch, Chris!  Thanks for calling me!
 
    Sincerely,......Alain
