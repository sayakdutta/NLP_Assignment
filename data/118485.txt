 
 That's fine with me - we're taking that approach on the "override" letters 
 that override existing master agreements.

 Mark, 
 I am fine with the user not signing.  It is your call though.

 Stacy/Mark,
 
 Can we revise the Texas Utilities letter so that the user does not need to 
 sign, but accepts the amendment by transacting on the website?
 
 As we have hordes of customers asking for User ID's, it would be appreciated 
 if we could land on a final, legal-approved draft of the letter, combined 
 with a list of affected customers for this morning.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Dave

 Stacy,
 
 Can we revise the text down to the following?
 
 Dear [Customer]:
 
 Please be advised that all U.S. physical natural gas transactions that you 
 enter into with EnronOnline will be with Enron North America Corp. regardless 
 of anything to the contrary on the website or in any General Terms and 
 Conditions, if applicable.
 
 
 This leter will be sent with the User ID, so it doesn't really require much 
 of an introductory sentence.
 
 
 Dave
