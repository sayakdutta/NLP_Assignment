 
 Pierre-Philippe,
 
 Yes, we are ready. I shall be accompanied by one person from
 our Analyst/Associate program and I would like to ask you if she can be 
 invited
 to dinner as well.
 
 We plan to come Thursday night and leave on Sat morning to avoid potential
 flight delay risk.

 Just touching base  for the 3rd of November. Is everything ready?
 
 Sincerely,
