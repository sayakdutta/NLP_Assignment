 
 You're correct, I am saddened to see such a great x-Philly treated so 
 poorly.  I often look back 
 with wonder at how much ground Stocker would cover at the shortstop position, 
 not to mention
 his tremendous power for a man of such small stature.  He could only be 
 compared to x-Philly
 and future hall of famer - Ivan DeJesus.  The only uncertainty is whether or 
 not Ivan will elect
 to be inducted under the Philly or Cubs uniform.
 
 On the house front,  we purchased one and moved in at the beginning of May.  
 It's a fixer-upper.
 All our weekends are spent working on it.
 
 I gotta run, but thanks for the email.  Let me know how everything is going 
 in your world.  Tell
 Rina and the kids we said hi.
