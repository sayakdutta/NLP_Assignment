 Dan,
 
 I'm very impressed with your prompt reply - thank you !
 
 The document looks good. Can we use this as a template for further buyback 
 confirmations ?

 Dan,
 
 I need your help with this confirmation please. 
 It is a buyback, which we currently don't confirm. However we have had a 
 request to send a confirmation out this time and I guess going forward we 
 should confirm these deals.
 We haven't got a template, but I've put something together I want you to look 
 at and especially where it's highlighted in red, we need some legal language.
 Please have a look and let me know what you think or if you need more 
 information, please contact me.
 
 
 
 Thanks
 Ellen
