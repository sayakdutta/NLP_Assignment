 RCOT.   The deficiency of $6500 is no big deal when they allocate to all of=
  the QSE's on a pro-rata basis, however what if the deficiency is $100 mill=
 ion and we our pro-rata share is $3 million?
 
 Do we have any legal recourse?   Do they suspend the deficient QSE immediat=
 ely?

 Gentlemen:
 
 I have a call in to Thane Twiggs from Regulatory affairs to ask what is at =
 the bottom of this.  Obviously this is a bad situation.

 QSEs that are owed monies from ERCOT on invoices that are due today, Octobe=
 r 15, 2001, will notice that the amount of funds transferred is short of th=
 e balance due on the invoice. This is a notification that ERCOT will follow=
  the "short payment" procedure stated in the ERCOT protocols for payments b=
 eing made to QSEs today.  Due to short payments by one or more QSEs, ERCOT =
 is insufficient of funds to pay all amounts in full.  As described in the E=
 RCOT protocols, section 9.4.4, ERCOT will deduct ERCOT administrative fees =
 and reduce payments to all invoice recipients that are owed monies. The red=
 uctions will be based on a pro rata basis of monies owed to each ERCOT cred=
 itor for this invoice to the extent necessary to clear ERCOT's accounts on =
 the payment date to insure revenue neutrality for ERCOT. ERCOT will distrib=
 ute past due funds on a pro rata basis of monies owed on the next business =
 day after receipt of the monies.=20
