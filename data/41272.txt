 Thanks!

 Marie,
 
   I am working this noon time on your orders.  I received pricing from Schumacher and Kravet and it is half of what you were quoted.  Both are in stock.  The purchase price will be a little more because of freight.  Also, my husband may want me to add taxes - because I am using his tax resale certificate.  I am checking with him and will let you know.  Do you want me to go ahead and place the orders?
 
   I have filled out the application for Robert Allen, but need to get banking information from my husband before I can send it in.  My goal is to have it done by Friday.  It's just been very busy here!  Sorry for the delay!
