 
 Sorry it has taken so long to get the scores out.  After 4 days in Vegas, 
 please check your scores - I am still in a daze.  Kansas - please forward 
 attachment to your friend Kris, Denver forward to Josh Stevens and John 
 Swinney please forward to Rob Fullen.  Here are the list of people I still 
 need money from:
 Josh Stevens
 Denver Plachy
 Jimmy Simien
 Eric Bass
 Flannigan
 Jason Wolfe
 
 Money must be to me by COB Wednesday or your entry is forfeited(if your score 
 is bad and you do not pay I will not put you in any pool in the future).
 
 Right now the pot is $410(assuming everyone pays) so the break down is 
 $307.50 and $102.50 for first and second respectively.  
 
 The following people need to give me a tiebreaker number for the final game 
 by COB Today(total score for final game):
 Jason Wolfe
 Denver Plachy
 Scott Earnest
 Chad South
 Doug Friedman
 John Nowlan
 Lee Jackson
 John Swinney
 Rob Fullen
 Josh Stevens
 
 If I do not get a tiebreaker from you and you tie for first, you will 
 automatically get second and if you tie for second you are out of the money.  
 
 Again, please verify your score and let me know of any discrepancies - 1 pt. 
 first round victory, 2 pts. second round victory and upset gets seed 
 differential.
 
 Thanks everyone for playing.
