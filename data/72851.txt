 
 I believe it is the E-Next Generation LV Co Gen contract.  I believe the last 
 draft was around the beginning of April.  I can check for more specifics.

 Dear Kay and Dale,
  Peter Thompson is on vacation and has asked me to make the
 attached changes (sent to Peter by Dale).  They are very
 straight-forward and will only take a minute.  However, there are a
 couple of contracts to which the changes could potentially apply, and
 I'd like to make sure I've got the right one before I start making
 changes.  Please let me know which contract needs to be changed, and
 I'll take care of the rest.  Thank you, Chris
 
 
     
 
 
 
 
     
 
 Here's what we're hearing from our contractor.  Can you work them in,
 Peter?

 I'm not sure the status of these agreements and the ability or
 appropriateness to incorporate changes. But, here's he input for
 consideration.

 Please consider the attached comments in your final
 negotiations with GE and ABB. Hopefully this format
 is more user friendly than the whole pile. These are
 Lauren/DHEC understanding of requirements to conform
 with EPC contract.  Bill Phillips

 Bill,
 
 In reviewing these documents we find that these changes were not
 incorporated.  Could you please make certain they are included.
 
 Thanks
