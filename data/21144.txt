 protests against each utility.  As well, please ensure that both Kevin and I 
 sign off on the filing before it goes out.

 Summary of emails detailed below:
 
 Dave Delainey and Kevin Presto have authorized Enron protests of utilities 
 seeking to renew their market based rates for power sales.  Enron has already 
 filed detailed protests against AEP, Entergy, and Southern Energy Marketing.  
 We also plan to file a detailed protest of Hydro Quebec.
 
 Protests of the following utilities will be very short (shown below) stating 
 that FERC should condition the continuation of market based rates upon the 
 utility joining a valid fully functioning RTO. ((Ameren, FP&L, LGE/KU, 
 Cinergy, TXU, VEPCO, and Duke).  Protests will be due over the next few 
 months.
 
 Please let me know if you want to receive copies of the protests or drafts.

 Kevin said this looks good w/ these changes:
 
 2nd para;  "Commission an (NOT AND) Open-Access Transmission Tariff"
 and last para:  Add after December 15, 2001 deadline  "or if a transmission 
 owner does not join a fully functioning RTO that meets all of the 
 Commission's requirements" 
 
 This needs to get filed today, if possible, as a request for rehearing in 
 Ameren Docket ER00-2687-001.  Note:  There were no interventions or protests 
 in this docket and FERC issued a letter order accepting the filing on Nov. 
 2.  What is odd and should be pointed out for why we are intervening at this 
 time is that there may have been a problem with when or how the notice was 
 issued.  Neither Nancy P. or our paralegal Jan saw this notice.  I found it 
 after the intervention date.  It is certainly odd that there were no 
 interventions in this at all.  One concern for Dan/Joe/Jim:  Since this is 
 going in as a late intervention and request for rehearing, what is the 
 likelihood of the Commission tossing the whole idea out quickly because of 
 the late intervention, which may hurt our overall cause.
 
 Next, this is the list of those utilities that we plan to file this pleading 
 in (We are not protesting Xcel/NSP/Pub Serv of Co):
 
 FP&L MAYBE Docket No. 97-3359-003 Protests due 11/20
 Cinergy (due in Jan)
 TXU (due in Jan)
 VEPCO (due next Aug)
 Duke (due next Dec)
 LGE/KU (due next March)
 
 NOTE:  Kevin wants to do a full blown assessment  against HQ , which is due 
 sometime this Nov.  Please keep all eyes out. for the HQ filing.
 
 THANK YOU.
