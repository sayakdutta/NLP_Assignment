 
 I talked to Greg Penman in Chicago and he was looking for some infomation on 
 LM 6000's, but I need to leave for the airport.  His number is 312.357.8872.  
 If you could go through this RFP or call him to see what other info he needs 
 that I haven't given him already.  Thanks
 Ben

 Here is the RFP that we talked about.  Any help you can provide would be 
 great.
