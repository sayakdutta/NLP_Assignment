 
 After this hearing staff makes a recommendation to the commission.  The commission decision should be issued in late Oct. or early Nov.
 
  
     
 Good news.  When do we expect to get a ruling?  Let me know.

 Gerald,
 
 The PSC held a pre-hearing conference today on the territorial dispute. It
 was uneventful. The Hilgert testimony was admitted as Exhibit 14 to WFEA's
 submission. WFEA sought a delay, Gulf opposed. No delay was granted.
