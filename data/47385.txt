 Stephanie, if I asked Sam to make sure that this is done, could you do so?  
 Thanx.

 The above counterparty has been created in the Financial Trading Agreements 
 Database and is listed as a master swap agreement, and it's not.  It is an 
 Electronic Trading Agreement and needs to be moved down to "Other 
 Agreements".  Please let me know when that is done and I will delete the 
 entry in  the master swap agreement database.  Thanks!
