 I used the following counterparties in the query:
 
 Central Illinois Public Service Company
 Central Illinois Light Company
 Illinois Power Company
 Northern Indiana Public Service Company
 Nicor, Inc.
 Nicor Energy LLC.
 Nicor Enerchange LLC.
 Nicor Gas Company
 Nicor Gas Marketing Company
 Nipsco Industries, Inc.
 Nipsco Energy Services, Inc.
 NiSource Capital Markets, Inc.
 
 The only deals I came up with were with Nicor.  If you have any questions, 
 don't hesitate to call me.

 Thanks for the list of existing transactions.  Only one question, it looks 
 like the list includes only the different corporate entities of NICOR.  Does 
 that mean that there were no existing transactions with the other Corporate 
 families, i.e. NIPSCO, CILCO, PGL and NS?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Gregg
