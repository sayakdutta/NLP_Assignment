 You should receive some formation documents relating to Edgecombe 
 Development.  The name is not spelled correctly (missing an "e"), but that is 
 being corrected at this time.  
 
  Bob spoke to me about wanting Enron to send a letter concerning the 
 financing arrangements for the project.  I would like for us to discuss this 
 as well.
