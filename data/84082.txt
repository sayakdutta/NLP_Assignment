 Glenn,
 
 Mary Jo Johnson is working on a facilities agreement with Mobil to 
 interconnect the Spanish Camp 6-inch line to the Mobil 14-inch Vanderbuilt 
 pipeline.  HPL will be responsible for setting a 6"x6" tee, riser, and 
 above-ground valve on the Spanish Camp lateral.  I suggest the 6x6 because 
 the gas sales contract that will go along with the facilities agreement 
 should specify an HPL scheduled delivery rate from 0 to 20,000 MMBtu/d.  The 
 6-inch will minimize pressure losses off of the Spanish Camp line and will 
 maximize our ability to expand this point in the future, if necessary.  
 Assume that we will need to acquire a small section of surface easement for 
 the above-ground valve.
 
 Looking at our as-built drawings (HC-1025-09-H) it appears that the Mobil 
 line crosses the Spanish Camp 6-inch at Station Plus 77+40 in the middle of a 
 pasture.  I spoke with Lonnie earlier today, who said that he would be in 
 that area on Wednesday and can verify that I have correctly located the 
 line.  The crossing pipeline is incorrectly identified as a 16-inch Natural 
 Gas line on the as-built.
 
 Mary Jo has asked for some agressive timing on setting the tee, in that she 
 would like to have it set for an 1 October, 1999 completion date.  In that 
 light, would you please approach this from the perspective of preparing a 
 work-order rather than a preliminary cost estimate.
 
 If any of these specifications change, I will let you know immediately.
 
 Thanks,
