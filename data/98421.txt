 
 Max-- I asked Bonnie White to assist me on this matter because I have been 
 swallowed up on another project. Bonnie is with the Enron Litigation Unit and 
 spends most of her time on ENA litigation issues. I know what is happening 
 and I am still very much involved. If a lawsuit  is filed Ileana Blanco at 
 Bracewell will be our trial atty. Her role is small at this stage.

 Max:
 
 As I indicated in my voice mail message to you, Bonnie White is an Enron 
 inhouse litigator who is handling the McKenna matter and Ileana Blanco is a 
 Bracewell Patterson attorney whom Bonnie has retained to represent Enron in 
 the McKenna matter.
 
 They are trying to learn more about the history of the McKenna project to be 
 able to distinguish it as clearly as possible from the Vitro project in an 
 effort to prevent the filing of litigation by McKenna.
 
 If you have additional questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

 Steves:
 
 Before responding, can either of you tell me what this call is about and who 
 B. White and I. Blanco are?  Also, do you know why Richard Sanders wasn't 
 included in the TC?
 
 Thanks - Max
