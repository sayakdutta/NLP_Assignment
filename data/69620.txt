 
 Gerald,
  
 Eric, in structuring, has this question on the wording of the Kennedy Amendment.  I told him you "the master of wording" was ok with it.  What do you think?

 PS   I hope it closes today! 
  
  
 
     
 
 Paul,
 The language regarding the volumes still has the phrase " up to" implying the customer may own some put rights. Can we remove that language and just say 10,000 MMBtu/d, etc?
