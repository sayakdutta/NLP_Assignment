 Is there any way we can get this deal in Sitra and pathed today for the sale of Centana Storage to AEP?

 Status?  We need to get it done this GL month, meaning it has to get in, pathed, actualized before mass draft (unless you want to manually draft).
 
 
  
     
 I emailed Mike Olsen, scheduler for Centana, to put the deal in Sitra and path it.  He was out today but will be back in tomorrow.  I will call him again tomorrow to make sure he gets it in the system before close.   Any questions, give me a call.  Thanks.
