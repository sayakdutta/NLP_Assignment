 Hi Gerald,           How are things going. Fine I hope we are all O.K. I
 called the other night and left a message just wanted to talk voice mail for
 a  change.!!!!!!!! Have been busy working in the yard. Had to trim all the
 shrubs and get rid of all the dead plants.    So what have you been doing.
 Anything new going on with you. James started planting this week. He is
 trying to get that moisture before it drys out.  We didn't get  any rain
 today again.  Starting to look bad.  I'm keeping Jenna and Jake tomorrow.
 Janice has a doctors appoitment. Nothing serous just a follow up. Got ashort
 email from Paul yesterday he's doing o.k...........Well all for now Dad and
 I send our love....Bye for now.
 
 Love...MOM
