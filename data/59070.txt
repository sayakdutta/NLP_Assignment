     Importance:	High
 
 John Sherriff and Michael Brown would like to send out the attached letter to employees in Europe this afternoon (ie in the next 3 hours).  I would be grateful if you would review it and let us have your approval as soon as possible.
 
 I have a couple of questions in relation to the content:
 
 1.  Can we refer to Wessex Water on our list of non-core assets in Europe?
 
 2.  Can we list the specific businesses under review as per the proposed draft below (which is not included in the attached draft?)
 
 "The businesses currently under review in Europe are Global Markets (except Coal), Industrial Markets, Metals, Credit and the Wind Turbine manufacturing business.  Also under review is the E Power generation asset development business in Japan".  Given that these businesses are being identified in the media I would assume that we can although note that they don't appear in your message point summary received last night.
 
 A prompt response would be very much appreciated.  Thanks.
 
 Jackie
