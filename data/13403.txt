 not have to be as long and involved as our current ones, but we should paper 
 it up.  Michelle

 Michelle:
 
 Gary Hanks is putting together a plan on how to better utilize his team in 
 supporting Bridgeline with their gas control training.  It may result in 
 having his team rotate during this one-month cross-training.  With this, do 
 we need to put together assignment letters indicating they will be rotating 
 on a monthly basis or can this just happen without an assignment letter.  I 
 don't think we need to add any additional compensation for this one-month 
 cross training.   All expenses will be paid by Texaco.
 
 Let me know what you think.
