 All:
 
 Louise will kick my ass if I don't have your addresses by the end of the week.  Please send them ASAP.  Reminder:  The wedding is Saturday October 20, 2001 in New Orleans.  Please forward to Shawn, Dietz, Jacques, and Maziarz - I don't have their e-mail.  I'll see most of you this weekend.
