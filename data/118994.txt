 Changes to Descriptions of US Physical Gas Products Delivered Within Texas 
 
 Due to the recent sale of the Houston Pipe Line Company by Enron, which was effective June 1st 2001, the Product Long Descriptions of US Physical Gas products for which the Delivery Point is located in Texas have been amended.  Instead of "Houston Pipe Line Company," your new counterparty for these transactions executed in the future will be "Enron North America Corp."
 
 This change affects EnronOnline physical natural gas products delivered at Carthage, Exxon Katy and Waha locations. We have added the following language to the Product Long Descriptions of these affected products: 
 
 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the General Terms and Conditions, if applicable, this Transaction is between Counterparty and Enron North America Corp.
 
 This language will supersede the language in the first clause of your "General Terms and Conditions" (GTC) agreement, which presently states, "In the event that the Delivery Point for a transaction is located in the state of Texas, "Enron" shall mean Houston Pipe Line Company."
 
 Please contact the EnronOnline Help Desk at (713) 853 HELP if you have any questions.
