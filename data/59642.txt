 This was settled with Chris Abel last night. We have always reported our positions in contracts, they want to see it in BCF.  We will be reporting it that way going forward.

 Dear Jim & Barry,
 
 We are getting info from gas and power.  We do have an issue with the inception to date P&L (see Chris's memo), and I'm also a bit concerned with the accuracy gas position reported to us of 5500 (short).  We've discussed it with Jeff's group and they have confirmed it, but it still seems a bit big to me.
 
 Well keep working.
 
 Best regards
