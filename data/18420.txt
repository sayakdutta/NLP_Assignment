 My name is Jeff Dasovich.  I'm in Enron's San Francisco office.  I think 
 you've spoken with Karen Denne.  Scott asked for some background materials on 
 our proposed solution to California's electricity crisis.  I'll be forwarding 
 those to you sometime between 5 and 6 PM PDT.  Does that work for you?
 
 Best,
 Jeff Dasovich
