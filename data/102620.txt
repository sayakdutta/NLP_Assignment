 
 Hello Dave.
  
 My understanding is that FERC does not yet require electronic contracting, 
 but that many pipelines do offer it voluntarily.  
 
 Best regards,
 Susan
 
 
 
 
 
 


  
  
 
 Hi,...did I guess correctly as to your e-mail addresses?  If so, I have a
 question....
 
 Do you happen to know if there are FERC rules requiring interstate pipelines
 (are you familiar with any?) to offer e-contracting (including e-signature)
 to customers/shippers, or is it a discretionary service...... or not a
 service at all?
 
 Of course, I need to do my own legal research, but maybe you two know off
 the top of your head.
 
 Thanks, and cheers...
