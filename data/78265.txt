 Johnson was reviewing the latest version of the GE contract that Pete 
 Thompson had sent out.

 Good morning Kay.  Its just me , Mr Nervous, wanting a status of the 
 finalization of the GE and ABB B/O E - Next contract signoff.
 I have a call in 1/2 hour with Jim Gilbert (LVCII Originator) on DASH 
 documents, of which these two are needed.
 
 Please let me know if the finals are done.  If not, when. If done, please 
 provide the official e copy to me.
 
 Thanks
 
 Regards
 
 Bill W.
