 Good afternoon -
 
 I wanted to quickly follow-up to make sure everyone is aware of the new EPE Reconciliation Model's location and status. I just skimmed through the first 8 days of this month, and we show no variances between the Real Time El Paso model and our CARP report. 
 
 The reconciliation model can be found at:
 
 	m:/Electric/Epe/Epe01/July01/July EPE Reconciliation
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate Symes
