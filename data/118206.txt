 
 Sorry about all these - it looks like people who don't know my address are 
 just guessing and they get you instead.  I'd appreciate it if you could 
 forward them on to me when they come to you - I'll let the sendersknow the 
 correct address as I get them and hopefully that should cut down the number 
 going forward.

 Do I need to continue to forward these to you, or are you already receiving 
 them?
