 Rob,
 
 I would like to visit with you on staffing your upcoming 4th Quarter legal 
 needs.  I understand that Enron North America may be looking for additional 
 outside counsel to help document a number of production payments currently 
 under negotiation.  Haynes and Boone has an energy finance team with 
 expertise in oil and gas, tax, derivatives and energy finance that is ready 
 to help. 
 
 I would like your advice on how Haynes and Boone can best approach your 
 production payment group. Please give me a call.
