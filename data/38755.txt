 I have heard that one from you before.  I don't even say shit like that 
 anymore because when I say shit like that I end up partying harder than I 
 would have had I just kept my mouth shut.  But in respect for your new job we 
 will make sure you are home and tucked in bed early!  :)  See ya soon!
