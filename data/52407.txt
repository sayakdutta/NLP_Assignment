 On October 7th at 2:57 p.m. (CST), Cindy gave birth to our son, Andrew
 Joseph Edward.  Andrew weighed in at 6 lbs. 12 oz. and is 19 3/4 inches
 long.  This makes him a very light feather weight, but we intend to get his
 weight up for future Olympic competition.  Mom is doing fine but feels like
 she has been hit by a truck.
 
 We thank you in advance for all of your good wishes!
 
 I hope this e-mail finds everyone in good health...and perhaps with a
 renewed desire to baby sit in the bayou.
 
 Tom
