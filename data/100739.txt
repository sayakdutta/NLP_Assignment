 
 Okay, there's a flight out of Houston on the 15th that gets into SD at 10:45 
 pm and the return flight is on Sunday around 3:30.  If that works for you I'm 
 going to go ahead and book the ticket now.  
 
 I'm so glad to hear that you're move was such a rousing success.  As for 
 myself and all of the guy juggling, I'm trying to get that under control.  
 Truth be told, none of them are worth a dime.  I think it was more of an ego 
 thing on my part.  Anyway, I still can't see the point in wasting time on 
 guys I'm not interested in so (like I said) I've ceased the rampage.  I'm not 
 taking any time off for Christmas so this trip would be a very welcomed 
 respite.
 
 Let me know about the times.
