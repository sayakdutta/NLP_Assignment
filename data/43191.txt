 
 Thanks.  To date I haven't heard anything from GISB.
 
  
     
 Stan,
 
 If you're still on GISB's Editorial Review Board, you should receive a communication from GISB this week or early next week.
 
 The pipeline segment has discovered numerous substantive errors in version 1.5 of the GISB standards, which were published last August.  We have requested that GISB correct the books and send the corrected publication to the FERC.  The Editorial Review Board will probably be asked to review the correspondence that will be sent to the FERC.
 
 I was involved in the pipeline segment effort.  Please let me know if you need further information or would like me to review the FERC correspondence when you receive it.  GISB has agreed to take specific actions that were requested by the pipeline segment.
 
 Thanks,
 Theresa
