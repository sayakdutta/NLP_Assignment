 
 Erik,
 I will be available earlier than 5:30 for an informal discussion.  I will be in the office Monday and Tuesday of this week.   I will be out the remainder of the week on vacation.
 Let me know if this works.

 I wanted to try to set up an appointment with you regarding any opportunities on the power desk.
