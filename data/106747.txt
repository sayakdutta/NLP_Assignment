 
 I have been receiving the "Enron International Southern Cone" list of 
 projects (updated weekly) for the B.A. office for quite some time.  As you 
 know, it covers trading Projects and Claims/Litigation/Regulatory.  Is there 
 a similar list prepared for projects originating in Brazil?  I would like to 
 recieve such a list as would the parties copied above.  Please let me know.
