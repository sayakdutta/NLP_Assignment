 Attached is a new version of the power cost model incorporating Roger's 
 updated info (retained generation costs and QF capacity payments).  It 
 improves the outlook for PG&E by > $2.00/MWH, mainly as a result of lower 
 cost estimates for their hydro.  SCE's numbers remains about the same.  FYI, 
 the prices in the model are at mid.  The switch to change to offer is now on 
 the Summary page.

 Attached is an update of utility delivery rates, native generation 
 weighted-average costs, and QF capacity payments and generation.
