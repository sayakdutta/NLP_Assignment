 > Thank you for your continued interest in the California Congestion
 > Management Market and our solution to resolve congestion in the coming
 > months.  And, a special thank you to those of you who attended the APX
 > Adjustment Bid Meeting in Santa Clara on February 21, 2001 where we
 > presented our technical solution for a zonal auction market for adjustment
 > bids.  We appreciate the opportunity to describe our solution to the
 > problem of arbitrary CAISO schedule cuts resulting from congestion that
 > will become even more of an issue as the summer approaches.
 >
 > As requested during our meeting, attached is a description of congestion
 > costs that can be avoided by your company and other California market
 > participants if such a market is implemented by APX.  We are also
 > including a request for your commitment to get this market started.  It is
 > extremely important that we receive your commitment to do the development
 > work necessary to get this market up and running.  Because of the limited
 > time remaining between now and June, we are asking for your commitment
 > before March 16, 2001.
 >
 > We believe that this market is essential to smooth resolution of
 > congestion in the coming months and have provided several options for your
 > commitment.  We also welcome other ideas that will provide your commitment
 > to support this market.
 >
 > Thank you for taking time to evaluate this offer.  Please contact John
 > Stremel (408-517-2120) or me if you have any questions regarding this
 > proposal.  If this should be forwarded to someone else within your
 > company, please send it along and let us know who the appropriate contact
 > should be.
