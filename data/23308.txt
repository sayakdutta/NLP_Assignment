 Dear Colleagues:
 
 A number of you have expressed interest in TI-USA providing a forum where
 your corporate regulatory and compliance counsel could share experiences an=
 d
 questions on anti-bribery compliance best practices.  The forum would provi=
 de
 an off-the-record environment for in-house counsel only to have a very
 practical and candid discussion on a range of issues, such as how much due
 diligence is enough.
 
 Honeywell has offered to host an exploratory luncheon meeting on November 1
 from 12:30 p.m -2 p.m. at its offices: 1001 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Suite
 700 South.
 
 We would appreciate your passing this invitation to the appropriate person =
 in
 your organization.
 
 Please RSVP to Nancy Boswell.
