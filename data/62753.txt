 Well, we finally got Greg Whalley enrolled in the "Executive Impact & 
 Influence" seminar.  Each of you have been listed for feedback in the 
 "peer/other" category.  It is crucial to Greg's success in the program that 
 all feedback be submitted.  
 
 I'll check back with you in a couple of weeks to make sure you are in receipt 
 of the feedback forms.
 
 Many Thanks,
 
 Liz Taylor
