 Someone sent this to me, it seemed appropriate!
 
  
 
  
 An old man and his wife have gone to bed. After laying there a few minutes
 the old man farts and says, "Seven Points."
  
 His wife rolls over and says, "What in the world was that?"
  
 The old man replied, "It's fart football."
  
 A few minutes later the wife lets one go and says, "Touchdown, tie score."
  
 After about five minutes the old man farts again and says, "Touchdown, I'm
 ahead 14 to 7."
  
 Not to be out done the wife rips another one and says, "Touchdown, tie
 score."
  
 Five seconds go by and she lets out a squeaker and says, "Field goal, I lead
 17 to 14."
  
 Now the pressure's on and the old man refuses to get beat by his wife so he
 strains real hard but to no avail. Realizing a defeat is totally
 unacceptable, he gives it everything he has, but instead of farting, he poops
 the bed.
  
 The wife looks at him and says, "What the hell was that?"
  
 And the old man replied, "Half-time, Switch sides."
