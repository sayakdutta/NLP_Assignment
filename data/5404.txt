 Yeah, I actually read that yesterday.  
  
 Have you ever been to Lawton or Ft. Sill, OK.  Knowing that area,  I understand his view of OK.  I did think 
 it was funny though his pointing out the "Bingo" sign being the first thing you see when you cross into OK on I-44. 
 I'll take that over the adult video sign on the south banks of the Red R. right beside I-35.  And no, I am not
 and have never been a patron.
  
 You don't have any spare tickets do you?
 
 
     
 
 Just a little something to get you fired up about this weekend!
