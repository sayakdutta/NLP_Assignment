 
 Hello Mr. Hughson,
 
 Ronald Melicher adviced me to contact you about the PhD program. 
 I am interested in the field of finance and I wanted to learn about the PhD finance program at the University of Colorado. 
 Can you summarize the main points of the program, its requirements,and the deadlines? 
 
 I have finished a finance degree from Oregon State University and have two years of work experience.
 
 Sincerely,
 Monika Causholli
