 Attached to this email you should find a marked version of the Enron Corp. 
 guaranty.  A few points:
 
 (1)  Bear claims that the "cap" language which we typically include is 
 inadequate because the wording implies (under NY law) that if a lesser amount 
 is owed at any time, then the cap is reduced to that amount. I've not heard 
 of this before.  I believe that they can send the treatise background info if 
 you'd like.
 
 (2)  The guaranty covers obligations of ENA in its Bear account and with 
 respect to the margin lending agreement.  Bear has added "performance" to the 
 guaranty as a guarantor obligation.  ENA's account obligations pertain to the 
 payment of money (margin); under the margin lending agreement, ENA could have 
 to deliver securities sold short in the market pursuant to a loan from Bear.  
 Failure to deliver these securities would trigger a default (which is 
 essentially reduced to a payment of money).  
 
 (3)  Although Bear removed our Setoff/Counterclaim paragraph, you should 
 refer to Par. 5 to see their own version!
 
 Please call me to discuss as ENA is anxious to reduce our margin rates with 
 Bear.  The Bear lawyer is leaving town tomorrow afternoon.
 
 Thanks.
