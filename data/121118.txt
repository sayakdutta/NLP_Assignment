And this will help your credit cause.  So now I am assuming that you guys are focusing on fixed basis for 1000/day with GD on the swing.  Would you guys be interested in looking at a transport structure for the first 18 months of the transaction?  I am looking at the economics of this to see if it will help you.  Call me if you need anything.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kim

 I believe he is the correct person to talk to, but if not, he can point you
 in the right direction.
