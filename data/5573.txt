 We are still wating on Bankruptcy court to decide our future.  The Dynegy deal fell through a couple of months ago.  My division (trading ops) will most likely be sold to either UBS or Citigroup.
 
 Keep in touch.

 Eric,
 
 Thanks for the Congrats.  Sorry I didn't get to see ya,  it'd been 6 months 
 since I'd gotten to see Marilyn and we had to go through the "rough 
 re-acclimation" period so once we got over it we wanted to spend all our 
 remaining time together.  The holiday bowl did in fact rock, I look forward 
 to next season.  How are you hangnin with this Enron fiasco?  You workin fer 
 Dynergy now?
 
 We're rollin to the field tomorrow, I'll drop ya a note when we get out.
 
 Take Care,
 
 Brett.
