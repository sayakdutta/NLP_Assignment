 
 Don,
 
 Attached is a request for a gas proposal for a retail customer in California.  Now that Roger Ponce is gone, and I am unable to get in touch with Derick Kelley, I no longer have a contact at EES to send these potential customers to.  Can you tell me who is handling retail customers in the West, particularly California?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kim Ward
 Manager
 West Gas Origination
 
  
     
 I'm sorry.  This is GAS rather than electricity.  Thanks.
