 Hello everyone.  The goal of Regulatory Affairs is to have livelink up and running for your use by no later than late November or early December.  In order to make sure you all can get into livelink without a hitch, please submit to me the list of names from your desk that will be using livelink.  They will then have guest access.  
 
 Please submit to me the list as soon as possible.  By next Friday, November the 2nd would be wonderful.  By then, you will see or should, the livelink link in your gas fundamentals page.
 
 Thanks,
 Melinda
