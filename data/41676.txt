 Thanks!

 Hi Marie,
 
 I hope you have a really happy birthday this weekend.  I would like to make a chocolate cake for your birthday.  I figure I could bring it in on Monday.  I know that everyone is so busy right now.  Do you think it would be okay?  If not, I could always make it and bring it to your house.  Just let me know.
