 
 Thanks for getting on top of this.  Please get the word out to the HR team 
 leaders as soon as you know more.
 
 
  
  
  
  
 Rocky Emery, the Dowd family, Kim Bowden, and another 15 or so employees of 
 UBSPaineWebber (our stock tracking provider...options, restricted stock, etc) 
 left yesterday evening without any warning.  They went to 1st Union.
 
 I've set up a meeting at 2pm today for us to go over to UBSPW and make sure 
 they understand the special needs of Enron and to make sure our service will 
 not be affected.
 
 I am reviewing the contract in place between PW and Enron to understand the 
 affects of this move by Emery and his staff on the agreement.  Also, I'm 
 going to see about getting 2 providers of the stock tracking service from the 
 following list:  (in case this happens again, we'll have a solid back-up 
 immediately)
 
 UBSPaineWEbber (our current provider)
 1st Union (where Rocky Emery went)
 Solomon Smith Barney (way ahead of the competition from a technology 
 standpoint...and has done the two provider thing before)
 Prudential (another option with internal connections)
 
 let me know if you think I should include any others or would like to discuss.
 
 Thanks,
 Aaron
