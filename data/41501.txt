 Hello,
 
 I work in the Credit Dept. and I'm trying to get a guaranty from a Mexican company. The deal is for physical methanol.  Currently Credit is using the attached format.
 
  
 
 I talked to Alan Aronowitz, and he said to check with you about any specific clauses you may have on guaranties in order to make them enforceable in Texas as well as in Mexico. Please let me know as soon as possible.
 
 Thanks,
