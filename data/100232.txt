 Even though we have changed the reimbursement from 50 / 50 on both interconnects to each entity paying 100% of one interconnect I still feel the language requiring either party to reimburse the other if operational circumstances constrain the physical intent of the interconnect is still needed.  In this way both entities will be aligned in trying to insure both the receipt and delivery interconnects function as intended.  Please let me know if you disagree.
