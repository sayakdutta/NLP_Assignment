 Cecilia is asking for the term paperwork and will set up an exit interview to answer his questions.   Please tell him to be on the lookout for an appointment with us today. 
 Thanks, H
  
     
 He was not offered a job in UBS.  He was told last Friday, by me, that he would remain in the Estate, so his resignation is from the Estate.

 I believe he is a UBS employee.   Jeanie, are you guys handling any terminations yet for these folks or do you want us to process? 
 Thanks,
