 
 Hattie,
  
 This recipe is from my Paris cooking class.  It is supposed to be wonderful served chilled (when we cooked it in class, we served it warm).  Be careful not to add too much cream since chilling it makes it a little thicker anyway.  Also, after you puree it in the blender, Marie Blanche (our cooking teacher) recommends that you strain all of the chunks out with cheese cloth. She says the reason for this is so that the guests will have a harder time figuring out all of the ingredients.  It is part of the Parisian mystery of cooking.
  
 Good Luck!
  
 Kim.

        Yes, I received the recipe for red soup.  It looks like one of your's, from your personal collection.  Looks delicious.  I think I'll prepare it early and serve it chilled.  What do you think?  Thanks for faxing it. 
        Jim has been at a trade show in New Orleans all week, and he's coming home tonight.  Yea!!!!
        We'll see you Saturday night.  
 Regards,
