 
 Thank you for a very successful holiday party.  Debbie and I thoroughly 
 enjoyed the evening.  Your hard work definitely paid-off for our entire 
 organization.
 
 I would like to host a lunch for the committee, after the holidays, as a way 
 of thanking you.   I will have Cindy coordinate your schedules.
 
 Thanks again,
 Stan
