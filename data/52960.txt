 Vince,
 
 I have contacted each person on the attached list regarding UW participation.  I think that we should reach the 100% mark by the end of the day.

 Here are the names of EWS Research people who have not participated in the United Way campaign as of 4:30 PM today.
 
 RAKESH BHARATI
 CHUANLI DENG
 SHANE GREEN
 PAULO ISSLER

 Tomorrow is the last official day of the campaign.  If you can get these people on board - to either pledge or decline - you will have 100% participation.
 
 Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help you.
