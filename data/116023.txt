 
 I took a message from Pat Brown at Avista this morning. She needed to book 
 one more spa reservation for Jean Gonnella. The only time Jean can do it is 
 between 3:30 and 6 p.m. on the Thursday they arrive. She would like a deep 
 cleansing facial and a french manicure. If there isn't time for both, she'd 
 just like the facial. Please call Pat and confirm the reservation time when 
 you make it. Her number is 509.495.8123. Thanks!
 
 P.S. I don't want you to think I'm passing the buck. I would have taken care 
 of this myself, but Mollie said you had a bunch more reservations to make on 
 Tuesday morning. Good luck, and let me know if you need help.
