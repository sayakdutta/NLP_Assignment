 is that we not be "marketing" the product with reference to the exchange - in 
 our view using the exchange in the name of the product would be a problem but 
 references to the exchange may be acceptable in the product description - an 
 example of what would not work would be describing the product as a "COMEX 
 lookalike" or something similar.

 Thanks Mark - my understanding however is that the long description with the 
 reference to COMEX will be viewable by Reuters users so does this change your 
 view or would we still be okay, given that the reference to COMEX is quite 
 benign (i.e. we have similar references in our long descriptions for IPE, 
 Platts etc.)?
