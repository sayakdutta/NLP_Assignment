 Hi Steve,
 I wanted to extend my sincere thanks to you for coming to Rice to
 interview and recruit. It was so enjoyable meeting you and having the
 opportunity to chat about Enron. I had a great experience there this
 summer, and I really appreciate the opportunity to interview for a
 full-time position. Thanks again for your time.
 
 Sincerely,
 Annie
