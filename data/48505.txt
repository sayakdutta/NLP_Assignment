 I do have some issues with the attached docuement, but am more concerned about the move from APB Energy Inc. to an new LLC from a credit perspective.  Who is our contact in Credit on APB or BrokerClient?  Please let me know when you get a chance.
 
 Thanks.

 Mark,
 
 This new company was created for tax purposes.  Do you see any problem with the assignment.  The letter of credit will need to change.
