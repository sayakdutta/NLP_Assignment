 
 Hi there.
 
 Is this required by our agreement, or just a nice touch?  We have a fairly 
 long list of people who we would have to track down, and it seems to me that 
 these people can be replaced (or have been) without the formality of 
 resigning.  I'll send you the list separately.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay

 Kay,
 
 Please have the appropriate managing directors and officers of CAED I
 and CAED II execute the attached resignations and return the executed
 resignations to Doug Pedigo.  If any other persons were manging
 directors or officers of CAED I or CAED II prior to closing, please have
 them execute similar resignations and furnish them to Doug.  Thanks.
 
 George
