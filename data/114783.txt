 
 Bob talked with TFS this morning and has the deals in his trade log now. I'll 
 get the deal numbers from him as soon as he inputs them, but you should see 
 those trades in the system soon.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate

 can you check with bob again, because i got confirms on the deals.  the 
 broker told me yesterday he forgot to tell bob.
 
 
 
 

 
   
  
 Bob does not recognize these deals, and tried to check with the broker. He'll 
 talk to TFS in the morning to verify these and I'll let you know ASAP.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate
