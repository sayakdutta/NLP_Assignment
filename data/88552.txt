 
 In response to your memo, concerning Article 11,   I have increased El Paso's 
 threshold to $10,000,000; Article 17.13 "further acts" and "deeds"  means any 
 further action that would need to be taken by either or both parties shall be 
 done, i.e. new taxes or tariffs etc.  This article gives assurances to both 
 parties that each will honor the necessary changes as required in the course 
 of normal business.  In addition, I  have changed the date to October 1, 2000.
 
 If this is satisfactory, I will send execution documents for signing. 
 
 Please review the attached, and let me know.    
 
    
 Best regards,
