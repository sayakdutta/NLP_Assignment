 
 John,
 
 This is a resume I received today from  my friend.
 Please, take a look at it. What follows below is a copy of his message to
 me:
 
 
 Dear Vincent,
 
 I very much would like to ask you for a career advice. I am looking for new
 challenges and new professional opportunities. Possibly there would be such
 opportunity around yourself  at Enron Corporation.
 
 I trust that my strongest asset is my intellectual capital and ability to
 look from new angles into complex issues. Beside of the experience of
 working under Jacob Goldfield an Paul Jacobson at Goldman on the interest
 rate swaps and proprietary desks, I was a part of research effort of John
 Meriwether group at Salomon Brothers, I headed the European interest options
 desk at DKBI in London and I have managed a small hedge fund in partnership
 with Albert Friedberg.
 
  I hold Ph.D. in mathematics from MIT and I have studied under Nobel
 Laureate in Economics, Bob Merton.
 
 I very much would like to apply my knowledge of capital markets, trading and
 research in the field of energy markets.
 
 With my very best regards and personal wishes,
 
 Mark Kierlanczyk
