 Happy New Year!
 
 And back to old business.  ENA is holding the amendment pending receipt from 
 you of the attached Exhibit A (describing the collateral).  I had previously 
 left you a message but I'm sure it was lost in the year-end madness.  Please 
 forward the attachment so that we have a complete document.  Thanks.  Sara

 I was just checking to see when we would execute the amendment to the 
 Security Agreement (to permit the rehypothecation of securities).  Please let 
 me hear from you.
