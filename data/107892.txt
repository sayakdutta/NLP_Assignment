 thank you.
 
 
    
 I spoke to Rudy Dautel and showed him the resume. The gas group is interested 
 in the cost share
 
 
    
 I do not need to interview the person selected for the weather group.  This 
 person will also support europe gas/power, and costs split as such between 
 organizations. 
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 

   
 Folks:
 We interviewed three candidates. One of the three (Tony Hamilton)  seems to 
 be a very good fit within the Enron culture and values.
 Recommended Next Steps
 Vince, Mike and Jeff interview Tony via video conference or avistar
 
 Tony Hamilton Key Strengths
 Quick thinker
 Good teams skills
 Driven - will be able to get the project off the ground quickly
 Has a commercial attitude
 Sees "the big picture"
 
 Tony Hamilton is available for follow up interviews the first week of January.
 Thanks
 Jen
