 Ted took his first steps back to solid foods on Monday night.  He was so sick 
 when we left you on Saturday that we had to motor the whole way back to 
 Tortola and put him ashore for Saturday night.  We made our flight on Sunday 
 and he went to the Dr. on Monday.  They think it was probably food poisoning 
 but I don't see why nobody else got it.
 
 Greg's expenses should certainly be part of the common fund.  There were a 
 few other common expenses we haven't settled up on yet - Ted had a few 
 groceries and a dinner and I paid for the beverage order).  I'll get Ted's 
 numbers when I get home tonight and do a tally which I can send tomorrow.  
 Let me know if you think of anything else.
 
 When I first get back I usually feel the room swaying when it is small and 
 enclosed (like an interior conference room or the shower).  It's a sure sign 
 you were acclimatised to the boat!
