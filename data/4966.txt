 Looks nice.  I just had my meeting with my V.P.- looks like I will be doing 
 my next rotation through EES tax (starts Aug 15th).  I hear it is a real good 
 group to work with (real smart and nice people)- but I think they put in a 
 lot of overtime- especially during federal compliance and some during state 
 compliance time.  Anyway- state compliance is in September and October- so 
 going before I rotate in August  might not be a bad idea- although I really 
 think they would let me take vacation whatever time I asked for.  Side 
 thought- when in the hell am I going to study for the CPA- especially since I 
 have NO motivation and I am about to enter a group that has lots of OT.  You 
 do realize that I am never going to pass that exam- and I'll probably lose my 
 job- and then either you or my family will just have to take care of me.  I 
 am feeling a little stressed/anxious today for some reason- in case you 
 didn't pick up on that.  I definately feel like I need a vacation.
