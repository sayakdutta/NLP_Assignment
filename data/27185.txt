 I agreed to stay through the end of the year (February)  to get this project off of the ground.   What I get in return is the responsibilty of trading around our assets in Texas,  a 500 mw unit,  Frontera,  and a 100 mw heat rate call from the City of Austin.   I have asked that these responsibilities be officially committed to writing.
 It is too late in the year for me to move to Portland,  get out and make a contribution for the summer.    These guys are in terrible shape here,  and I am needed.
 I report to Lloyd Will,  who is a great guy.    I am working with Doug Gilbert-Smith,  who is the Ercot Term trader.   He has agreed to share some of his knowledge with me and I am spending time with the gen group to learn more about the steel.  I will be working with Miller and Smith (weeeeeelllll?)   
 This was the best option for me at this time,  and also for the company. 
 
 I will be leaving the main office in February,  whether it is with Enron or not.   I would prefer to stay with the company,  as my options are worth zero at the moment.
 We still want to return to Portland,   but right now I am needed here.   
 
 Thanks for checking.    Let me know when you are coming down,   but dont bring your sweater.    Hope things are going well for you and your group.
 I'll give you a call later and tell you what's what.    (hey,  I never used to say  that - you were stereotyping).
 
 Later,
 JMF
