 
 Hi!  I'm the ENA lawyer with whom you will be speaking with respect to this 
 Master Agreement.  I know that Marie Heard has called you regarding your 
 review of this document and I was hoping to facilitate that discussion.  
 Please let me know if you have specific questions and/or if we can schedule a 
 conference call.  You can reach me via email of (713) 853-5620.  Thanks.  
 Sara
