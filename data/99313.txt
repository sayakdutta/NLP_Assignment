 In connection with the subject referenced above, we are in receipt of the materials that you forwarded to Eileen Kisluk for review and further handling.  Unfortunately, we did not receive a full copy of the Purchase and Sale Agreement by and between Enron North America and Allegheny Energy Supply Company.  We received pages 2, 6,10, 12, 36 - 39.  While it appears that we received the articles addressing indemnity, they reference other sections and articles of the agreement that we did not receive and are necessary for Eileen's review.
 
 Can you please provide our office with a complete copy of the agreement?  We would be happy to send someone to retrieve the copy when it is available.
 
 Thank you for your assistance.
