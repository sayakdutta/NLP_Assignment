 I'm finalizing what we talked about yesterday and something struck me w.r.t. 
 siting reform.
 
 One of our key messages in California and nationally is that price spikes are 
 due in no small part to outmoded, arcane siting rules and a shortage of power 
 as a result.  Price spikes have led to wholesale and retail price caps, 
 investigations, utility under-recovery, and threats of rolling back 
 de-regulation, to name a few.  
 
 Understanding that Dave raises some good points about why he's not thrilled 
 about getting involved in more siting reform bills, could someone argue that 
 from a corporate objective, getting a good siting reform bill passed this 
 session is a fairly high priority?  I'm not sure what the answer is, but it 
 struck me as I was pretty-ing up the document and I thought I'd put it out 
 there for reaction.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
