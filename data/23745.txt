 
 This Term Sheet does not create and is not intended to create a binding and 
 enforceable contract between the parties and may not be relied upon by either 
 party as the basis for a contract by estoppel or otherwise, but rather 
 evidences a non-binding expression of a good faith understanding to endeavor, 
 without obligation, to negotiate mutually agreeable definitive agreements.
