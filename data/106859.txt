 
 I will have the letter executed.  I changed references in third to last 
 paragraph to read "ECT" rather than "Enron" and replaced Bill Coffman's name 
 wtih Robert Loughran, ext. 142.  Do you assume responsibility to transmitting 
 to Canadian immigration or do we?  Please explain the process.  Thanks.  Sara
