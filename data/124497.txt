 glanced 
 up and saw a very beautiful woman boarding the plane.  He soon realized
 she 
 was heading straight toward his seat.  Low and behold, she took the seat
 
 right beside his.  Eager to strike up a conversation, he blurted out, 
 "Business trip or vacation?"
 
 She turned, smiled and said, "Business.  I'm going to the annual 
 Nymphomaniac Convention in Chicago."
 
 He swallowed hard.  Here was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen 
 sitting next to him and she was going to a meeting for nymphomaniacs!  
 Struggling to maintain his composure, he calmly asked, "What's your
 business 
 role at this convention?"
 
 "Lecturer," she responded.  "I use my experience to debunk some of the 
 popular myths about sexuality."
 
 "Really, what myths are those?" he asked.
 
 "Well," she explained, "one popular myth is that African American men
 are 
 the most well endowed, when in fact, it's the Native American Indian who
 is 
 most likely to possess that trait.  Another popular myth is that French
 men 
 are the best lovers, when actually it is the men of Jewish descent.  We 
 have, however, found that the best potential lover in all categories is
 the 
 Southern redneck."
 
 The woman started to feel a little uncomfortable and blushed.  "I'm
 sorry," 
 she said, "I shouldn't really be discussing this with you, I don't even
 know 
 your name."
 
 "Tonto," the man said.  "Tonto Goldstein, but my friends call me Bubba."
