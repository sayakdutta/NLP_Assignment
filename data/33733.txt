 I suggest adding Alain Diza (EES scheduler) or Patricia Downey (EES VM) instead of/along with myself as they actually know something about Dominion.    :)

 Hey there team.  We are starting to focus on Dominion pipeline and I need your help explaining the process to Shemin.  I would like to set up a meeting with Gloria, Wade, Shemin, Kathryn as soon as possible.
