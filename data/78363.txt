 They better start taking care of you!  The spa is always 
 something to look forward to isn't it!  I wish I could 
 get a massage, but I can't lay on my stomach yet.  The 
 doc said today no ab work until July!  He said he didn't 
 want me getting a hernia and then have to have more 
 surgery.  I couldn't agree more!  I'll just walk.  I've 
 lost 20 pounds since January.  It was all that junk from 
 the gallbladder -- that's why I couldn't lose any 
 weight.  I'm feeling pretty thin, but then I start my 
 period on Wednesday!!!!!!!!!
