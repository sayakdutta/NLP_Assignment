 I will be having about 5-7 other people that I will need added to this 
 database.  Should I send these requests back directly to you, or do them 
 through the system as well?
 
 Also, there are two ways of getting edit access through this database.  One 
 is for employees of Legal, who can then enter Legal comments, and the other 
 is for employees of Credit, who can then enter Credit comments.  Do you see 
 that choice?  Is there some way for me to verify which employees of Legal and 
 which employees of Credit have what access?  I know that some employees of 
 Credit have Legal access by mistake.  Can I get lists of the Legal and Credit 
 breakdowns?

 Good morning,
 
 Please provide the path to the Financial Trading Agreement database.  The 
 information can be found by right-clicking on the database icon, then 
 selecting Database properties.  The Server and File name will be under the 
 Basic tab.
 
 Have a nice day,
