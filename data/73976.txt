 I don't think I've been fishing since July.  Geez, it is half way through 
 September.
 
 I'm in Chicago today (NYC yesterday).  A whirl wind tour.
 
 I hear the Aquarium closed - killed by bike lanes.  Two weeks later the owner 
 died.  We need to find a "new" dive.

 Yeh-huh. I sent an e-mail. I will dredge up and resend. Been fishing lately?
 
 
   
  
 I'm either losing my mind or my email.  Did you send me an email re GE?  I 
 thought I saw one, but now I can't find it. Is that a trick, and if so, how 
 do I do it?  
 
 Could you resend it, please?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
