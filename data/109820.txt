 Dear Mr. Skilling:
 ?
 On Wednesday, October 24, we will be presenting the  9th annual President's 
 Forum of Houston at the HESS Club.? Over 150 business owners in the Greater 
 Houston area will  attend this by-invitation-only conference.? The goal is to 
 help  business owners grow their  businesses.

 Mr. Ken Lay was the Kick-Off speaker for this  program 2 years ago.? We would 
 be very honored if you
 could do the same thing this year.? I know  that you are leaving for South 
 America that day, but you might
 take a 1/2 hour break in your schedule first thing  in the morning to speak 
 to our group!? The Kick-Off is scheduled for 8:30  a.m.

 The Entrepreneurship Institute is a non-profit  organization that was founded
