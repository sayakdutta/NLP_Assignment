 I am not sure what the fee is but yes there has already been a firm 
 commitment to speak at the meeting (Haug days).  I tried to get out of it but 
 too late.  We are turning our presentation into an EOL push for electronic 
 trading for LPG and LNG.  
 
 I will run down if we actually have to pay 200 grand as well.  Brochures - 
 yes there is a draft floating around but I have told these guys that I do not 
 want anything put together specifically for the meeting.  I thought we could 
 wait till we start making some cash and have a better handle on who we want 
 to focus on in terms of customers

 Are we sponsoring gas tech (in houston) Nov 15 ish for $200,000?  What's up 
 with the brochures?  Yes? No?  Your call on all of this.
