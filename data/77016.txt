 
 Stuart,
 
 Kay's venting for the day:
 
 Is it nitpicking to expect outside counsel to (1) make sure the option 
 agreement is signed AND acknowledged (2) ascertain whether the thing has the 
 dates filled in, and (3) makes sure that the legal description is included?
 
 Ok, maybe I'm whining, but I think Mark should know that we are having 
 problems.  Have you mentioned anything to him?

 Karen,
 
 There are a few outstanding items missing on the Ledford and Fehr Option
 Agreements.  They are as follows:
 
 Ledford Property
 
 1.   Steven and Lynn Ledfords's signatures were not acknowledged.
 
 2.   Exhibit B (Grant of Easement Legal Description) was to be inserted.
 Since it is our intention to have executed and record a Memorandum of
 Purchase  Option and Grant of Easement, shouldn't we obtain from the
 Ledfords: (i) a legal description of the easement; or (ii) a legal
 description of the parent tract for      reference purposes; or (iii) a
 property identification number of the parent tract at the very least to
 include in the Memorandum?
 
 Fehr
 
 1.   No legal description (Exhibit A) was attached to the Fehr Option.  Do
 you have a copy of the legal description?  Please advise.
 
 I look forward to hearing from you regarding the above.
 
 Thank you
