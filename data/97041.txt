 We are re-evaluating the EBS trading structure.  Currently, EBS uses a series of LLP's to minimize/avoid Texas franchise tax.  I detest LLP structures, as they can be hard to maintain; Lisa feels the same. Our EBS tax contact (Wayne Gardner) advises us that ENA/EPMI handle the franchise tax issue with some form of out-of-state swap, or something along that line.  I'm looking for a contact person who might know something about it.  I'm guessing Stephen Douglas is a good prospect, although I understand he is out.  Any thoughts/suggestions/cautions?
  
 Thanks,
  
 Kay
