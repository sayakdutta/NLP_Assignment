 GPCM Modelers,
 Here's an article from Powermarketers.com regarding a recent IPAA short-run
 forecast.  Note that the title is wrong.  The information in the article
 implies a year 2001 22.56 tcf total US consumption not output (production).
  And, that consumption includes pipeline fuel and lease and plant fuel.
  Production in 2001 is est at 18.94 tcf (not sure whether marketed or dry,
 but probably dry.)
 It could be an interesting point of comparison for your own near term
 forecasts.

 You might also want to look at IPAA's November 1998 forecasts:
