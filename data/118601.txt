 are home, I also received the following from the PR department a few minutes 
 ago:
 Be sure to watch Chairman and CEO Ken Lay on Fox News today.  He will appear 
 on "Our World" with Neil Cavuto at 4:30 p.m. CST to discuss Enron's year-end 
 financial and operating highlights.

 I received the attachment you sent to me at Christmas but was not sure how 
 well it worked for you to recieve them.  I took a roll of film to be 
 developed and they had a special on having the photos returned on a disk as 
 well as prints.  I though they were the Christmas pictures that I could send 
 to you right away - but it turns out it was an old roll.
