 was only about a half an hour late getting into Houston.  I made it to bed by 
 12:15 am and managed to drag myself out of bed at 5 am.  I have a bunch of 
 work to do this week which SUCKS, but I'm interested and excited about what I 
 have to do, so it's good.  Fortunately this scheduling thing has become 
 second nature so I don't really have to think too much this morning.  How are 
 you?

 i was thinking you're flight was probably very delayed b/c of the weather.  
 what time did you get home and when did you wake up?
