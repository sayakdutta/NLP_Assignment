 What a miserable "friend" I am!  I would love to meet you and Donna anytime 
 at all.  Please let me know.  I have been running around like crazy.  We are 
 understaffed and I work too hard.  Also, I had to take a week off in mid-July 
 to rescue my mom who ended up in a hospital in Salisbury, England while 
 attempting to attend the funeral of a cousin.  Mother is fine.  I (on the 
 other hand) do not take a vacation until October and I hope to live.  Maybe 
 you and Donna want to come over one night and raid my wine cellar.  That 
 would be fun for a change.  We could pick up food from Eatzi's or wherever.  
 Can't wait to hear from you.  Sara

 Sara:
 I had a very delightful lunch today with a dear friend of yours, Donna
 Mullen of Dominion. Paul Dunning introduced me to her at the AAPL in New
 Orleans, and she was nice enough to attend a dinner I hosted at Antoines
 during the convention. We want to have lunch with you. Are you free for
 lunch at all next week. We will come downtown to meet you. Sorry I
 missed you last week during my break from the South Texas Mineral Law
 CLE seminar. Mary Ogden, a good friend, showed me your office and
 introduced me to some of your co-workers. Everyone says you are the
 best. It is nice to be able to say that I am a friend of Sara's from New
 Orleans and watch everyone's face light up. You and Julia have a great
 group of co-workers there.
 
 I hope you and the hounds are well.
