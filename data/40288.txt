 Actually DSTAR is doing very well.  There is a very business mined 
 independent board that is very helpful.  We are getting most everything we 
 want in the DSTAR arena.  The only problem with the governance of DSTAR is 
 that public power tries to dominate the advisory groups to give a front to 
 legitimize its votes giving advice to the board.  The board is very aware of 
 this and does its job well.  There was discussion with my SWPTF and the 
 southwestern jurisdictional utilities to merge DSTAR and California and the 
 effort was going very well until senator peace started some of his antics.  
 Anyway, DSTARs a very good process right now.
