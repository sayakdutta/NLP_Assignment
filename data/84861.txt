 Randy,
 
 I'd like to speak with you this morning.  I'm having Gerald research Texas 
 law on: (i) failure of conditions precedent resulting in failure to form a 
 contract  and (ii) breach of contract sufficient to afford termination as a 
 remedy for breach.  Any help you can offer today in your shop on these 2 
 issues would be appreciated.  Our guys want to issue a termination notice as 
 soon as possible.  I want to know what common law of contract says before we 
 do.  
 
 Call me when you get a chance.
 
 Steve
