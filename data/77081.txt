 I haven't seen a copy of the Sept 28th letter yet, but I've been at an 
 offsite, so I might have missed something.  I'll get you a copy of CO #1.  CO 
 #2 has been transmitted to GE for comment.  I'll have to confirm the status 
 of the MOU and CO#3/#4.  These have bounced around a bit, so I need to nail 
 it down so I don't give you bad information.

 Kay, I was hoping you could provide me with executed copies of Change Orders 
 1 and 2 and the September 28th letter agreement regarding Enron's title 
 acceptance of units 1-6 and 9-14.  I need to provide them to WestLB as the 
 ADA requires prompt delivery to them of executed contracts.
 
 Also, where do we stand on Change Orders 3 and 4 and the ENA/ESA "MOU"?  I 
 know that the last I heard Sheila was working the MOU, but I thought you 
 mights know as I am writing to you.
 
 Thanks, Lisa
