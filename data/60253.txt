 
 I definitely had a black mat last time.
 
 I would like a black mat again.  In reality this is a picture for a friend so I will copy to her and she can order it directly based on the fact that it doesn't look like I got any discount for being a returning customer.
 
 So Ellie, this is what you want with a black mat.  
 
 MTX233-60 Solitude, Lake McDonald   $1030.00  ($936.36 ex GST  for o/seas
 orders)
 FRMM60 Mount and mat $198.10 ($180.09 ex GST)
       Freight $250.00  
 
 Fay, please co-ordinate with Ellie.
 
 Thanks for your help

 Good afternoon Louise
 
 Thanks for your email.  I have outlined some costs below for you.

 Louise, you have mentioned a black mount - the mounts are the board that the
 image is adhered to and is not visible.  Do you mean a black mat.  Your last
 image was mounted with a cream mat, however in this instance I would use a
 mist mat as cream would perhaps be a little yellow for this image.  Mist is
 not as yellow.  There will always be a small black border between the image
 and the mount.
 Freight $250.00  - you will be happy to notice that the rates for shipping
 have decreased a little.
 
 Total cost $1366.45.
 
 Louise, I hope the above information is helpful and if there is anything
 else I can assist with please let me know.  I look forward to hearing from
 you with your final decision.
 
 Cheers
 Fay
