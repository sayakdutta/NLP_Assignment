 Yes, I am still headed to Spain.  I am actually leaving on Friday, so I need 
 to get those tickets to you pretty soon.  Let me know what days you are in 
 town this week.
 
 The 8th works for me. Where is the Duke party this year?

 Hey man!  Haven't talked to you in awhile.  Hope things are good.  David
 reminded me about the game the other day.  Are you still headed to Spain
 for Thanksgiving?  If so, let me know when you want to get together and do
 the ticket/money swap.  I'll be in Florida this weekend, but should be home
 on weekends after that for awhile.  Or, we can do it one week night if I'm
 in town.  Unfortunately, my travel schedule is not slowing down around the
 holidays like I'd hoped.
 
 I also have another favor to ask - is there any chance you would go to our
 Christmas party with me on Dec 8 if I go?  David will obviously be there,
 too.  I'm such a loser that I've had to go by myself the last three years
 and that's such a drag.  Let me know if you think you'd consider it.
