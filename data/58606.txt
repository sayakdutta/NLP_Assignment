  five years
 
 
 The note below was sent to the 20 or so reporters that I have been working
 with on the CA electricity crisis.
 
 FYI.
 
 Below is a press release we distributed today that details a proposal we
 have made to San Diego Gas & Electric to manage their entire electricity
 load (up to 3,300 megawatts) for five years at a fixed price of $60 a
 megawatt hour.  The proposal was detailed in our comments to the Federal
 Energy Regulatory Commission on their recent proposed solutions to
 Caifornia.
 
 As the release indicates, forward contracting for electricity is a very
 effective way for the state's utilities to manage the volitility in the
 state's electricity markets.  With natural gas prices more than doubling
 since last year and last week being up to seven times higher than last year
 on the spot market (up to $19 a million BTU vs. an average of about $2.50
 in 1999), we feel that its imperative for utilities to take advantage of
 these contracts so they can manage their own risk  exposure and their
 customer's risk exposue to this volitility and the associated high prices.
 (The price of natural gas represents about 90 percent of our plant's
 operating costs).
 
 We signed a forward power contract with PG&E Oct. 30 and Southern Cal
 Edison Nov. 15 (announced for the first time in the this release).  The
 Federal Energy Regulatory Commission strongly encourages these kind of
 contracts -- and we hope that we, or other wholesale power marketers, can
 do more of this kind of business with these utilities and SDG&E in the very
 near future to bring stability to the state's wholesale electricity market.
 
 Our proposal is detailed on pages eight and nine in the FERC filing, which
 also includes our other positions on the California electricity crisis.
 These are also detailed on our CA web site at
 www.Duke-Energy.com/California.
