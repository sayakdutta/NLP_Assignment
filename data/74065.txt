 
 So do you know where the piece of the contract came from?  Maybe we can track 
 down the rest.  I have seen an electronic copy of a contract which may or may 
 not be the correct one since the delivery date is last June.  I think ENA 
 needs a complete copy of the contract, including any executed change orders.  
 Do you think someone in your group might have that?
 
 Many thanks,
 
 Kay

 What I have is on the fax to you right now.  I do not have the entire 
 contract.  Sorry,

 FYI, I want to see if we are in compliance with the confidentiality 
 provisions of those contracts.  In fact, I would  like to get a copy of the 
 501 D contract (I have the GE contract).  Do you have a copy of the entire 
 thing?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay

 Kay,
 
 I have that information, provided by EECC and reviewed by Ben J and Jeffrey 
 K.  If you are somewhere where I can fax it to you or bring you a copy, let 
 me know.

 Hi Guys,
 
 I'm trying to figure out what info we submitted from which turbine 
 contracts.  Could someone please identify the contract and what was sent to 
 Allyson?
 
 Thanks,
