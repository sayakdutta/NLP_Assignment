 On January 14, 2000, we transacted with Conective via NatSource for a Nov '00 

 indicates we bought the swap.  The broker confirm indicates we sold the 
 swap.  Our confirm to the counterparty was executed as Enron buying by their 
 operations manager, Joseph Glace.  The counterparty is contending that the 
 broker confirm is correct.  Trading contends our confirm is correct and 
 binding.  How should we proceed?  The value of the position is roughly $3MM 
 of revenue.
 
 Thanks,
