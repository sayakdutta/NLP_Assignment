 
 These flows are due to the timing of the meter change.  So, I have adjusted Sitara to cover the 4th and 7th.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 Daren-
 Looks like the meter statement is showing some gas was pulled on days April 04 & 07  that was not priced or pathed.
 Please let me know what price Tenaska should be billed for these two days.  
 
 Thanks- Katherine
