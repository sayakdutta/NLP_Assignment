 
 Hey Aunt Bonnie,
 
 I thoroughly enjoyed your visit as well.  It has been too long since the last 
 time we got together.  I hope that we get to see more of each other in the 
 coming years.   Hopefully, we can make a trip up to Pennsylvania soon.
 
 Love,
 
 Eric
 
 
 
 

    
 
 Hi Eric,
 
 I really enjoyed my visit to Texas.  It was great
 seeing you and meeting Shanna.  You have grown into a
 fine young man and I'm proud of you.  I hope to see
 you again maybe next year. Keep in touch.
 
 Love   Aunt Bonnie
