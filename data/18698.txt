 Do you know what the subject of the proceeding is?  I'm traveling, but will 
 try to get you info.
 
 Best,

 Drew Fossum needs some info on the CPUC proceeding  11-002.  Addtional 
 testimony was filed by Socal.  We need to know if we can become a party and 
 file testimony at this time if we felt we needed to ?  Also can you find out 
 whether anyone has filed additional supplemental testimony. Please call me at 
 713   853-6981
