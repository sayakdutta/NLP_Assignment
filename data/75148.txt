 Sorry I haven't sent the notice.  Brain cramp or something.
 
 
 
 When are you here next week?

 Dale's probably a likely suspect.  Any luck finding your form of notice to 
 exercise option to take down the equipment??  Please share if it's handy!  
 Thanks. 
 
 I'll be in Houston next week;  I'll find you to say hi.
