 
 Alex,
 
 Thanks a lot. I could open our resume.
 We hire part-time employees to help
 us with our weather effort: the work is
 concentrated in the early morning hours
 6:00 to 10:00 a.m.
 
 I shall check with Mike Roberts who runs the group
 about our needs.
 
 Please, let me know if you are interested in
 a summer internship in 2002. The decisions
 are made in late January and February and 
 you should let me know by then.
 
 Vince
 
 
  
     
 Dear Director Kaminski,
 
 Thank you for your reply! I am trying to use
 Yahoo!Mail to send my resume since something is wrong
 with my default email system, Microsoft Outlook.
 Please tell me if you still cannot read my resume.
 
 Take care,
 
 Alex
