 It is standard operating procedure to copy all assistants (to the extent you 
 know who they are) on e-mails such as this.  In the future please make sure 
 you copy me on any e-mails pertaining to meetings or business lunches in 
 which Mark Haedicke should participate.  Thank you for your cooperation in 
 the future.
