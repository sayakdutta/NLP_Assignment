 Hi!
 
 Just a quick note to say good-bye and thank you after five and a half years!  
 My last day at Enron will be Thursday, August 31st.  I will be heading off to 
 two new jobs -- to be a full-time mom once Baby Lee arrives and to start my 
 own stationary/invitations company.  
 
 I have thoroughly enjoyed working with all of you.  Thank you for all the 
 opportunities you have given me over the years.   For your Community 
 Relations needs, Elyse Kalmans is heading up the department.  She can be 
 reached at 713.853.0565.
 
 Thanks!
 amy
