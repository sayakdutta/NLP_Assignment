 
 Gwen,
 
 Dolores Muzzy gave me your name as a contact for information regarding the 
 redesigned Analyst/Associate programs.  I am currently half-way through my 
 second rotation with the Analyst program and was hoping to get a better idea 
 of the different opportunities available to me upon completion of my current 
 rotation.  Although six months seems like a fair amount of time to plan my 
 next move, I know how quickly it will pass and do not want to find myself 
 uncertain as to what action to take to insure that I am heading in the right 
 direction to meet my current goals.  I would appreciate the opportunity to 
 meet with you and discuss the aforementioned topics at your earliest 
 convenience.  If there is another individual you feel would be a better 
 contact for me at this point I would be happy to meet with them as well. 
 
 Thank you,
 
 Susan Scott
