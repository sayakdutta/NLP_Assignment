 Please have your presentations for the NNG Winter Ops meeting sent to Debbie Moore, who is in Gina Taylor's shop, by August 20th. Debbie will then put all the presentations in the same format. We want to be able to make copies here in Houston and ship to Kansas City rather than pay Kinko's up there to make copies which is very expensive. Your co-operation is appreciated. thanks. sj
