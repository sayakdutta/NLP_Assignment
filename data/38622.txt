 
 We now have a PG&E topock basis product on EOL.  The curve is currenlty 
 mapped to Socal with the differential to Socal being calculated in the 
 physical index curve.  Let's work on setting up this curve on Tuesday so that 
 it shows the accurate value for fin deals.  We can have the curve calc off of 
 a discount to citygate in Keith's spreadsheet.
