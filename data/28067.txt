 a good idea.  DF

 Steve filled in the detail for me on the LG&E issue mentioned in the Law 
 bullets this morning.  A valve was left open between an LG&E facility and 
 Northern for an approximate 3 month period (I'm not sure how recent).  LG&E's 
 gas loss data indicates that the amount of gas that inadvertently got into 
 Northern was approx. 180,000 MMBtu, with a value of about $500,000.   Rockey 
 and Steve have talked to LG&E and it does not appear that we have any good 
 arguments for avoiding the liability.  The unexpected (and unmetered) 
 deliveries from LG&E presumably reduced our lost and unaccounted for balance 
 during the referenced 3 month period.  Accordingly, I assume the cost of 
 replacing that gas should be accounted for in Northern's PRA and so should 
 not affect earnings.   I'm not sure what the timetable is for resolving this 
 matter.  DF
