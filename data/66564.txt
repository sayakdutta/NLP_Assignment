 	How was your trip?  I hope you were able to get lots of sleep.  Huy tried to get me to go drinking last night, but I was far too tired.  I didn't get done with interviews 	until after 7:00 PM.  Trang said you told her to take care of me while you were gone.  I thought that was very sweet, yet I can't help wondering if you think I can not 	take care of myself (that was a joke by the way). 
 
 	Kelly sent me Linda's numbers with plenty of attitude.  She mentioned something about you having an abundance of time while she has a scarcity of time.  But you 	can't tell her I told you.  
 
 	Looks like I gotta go.  I miss you, and look forward to hearing from you.
 
 	Love,
 
 	Andy
