 I've taken a look at both the Sher bill (SB 532) and the 2nd version of SB 78.  The Sher bill has substitute language that is identical to SB 73 -- establishing an RPS for both new and existing sources.  I have several concerns (large percentage of new...1/2 of TX requirement in first year.... unclear REC program.....mandatory bilateral purchase of renewable power output scheduled into CA ISO or LADWP)  and am crunching numbers with Jenn to get an idea the likely impact ($s and mWh).  Will get the numbers and analysis by late morning.

 The following energy bills will be heard today.
 
 SBX2 78 (Polanco/Sher), SCE MOU, will be heard by the Assembly Energy, Costs
 and Availability Committee upon adjournment of the Assembly Transportation
 Committee (approximately 2:30 p.m.) in room 437.  Late Friday, Assemblyman
 Hertzberg informed his caucus that the Assembly may take this measure up on
 the floor as early as today.  Because floor session is currently scheduled
 for 11:00 a.m. this would require the Assembly to reconvene late this
 afternoon, however, this has not been scheduled and such an action would
 likely interfere with several Assembly fundraising events this evening.
 
 SBX2 1 (Soto/Scott), windfall profits tax, will be heard by the Assembly
 Revenue and Taxation Committee at 1:30 p.m. in room 126.
 
 SB 532 (Sher), renewable portfolio standard, will be heard by the Assembly
 Natural Resources Committee at 1:30 p.m. in room 447.  This measure would
 require DWR and/or the IOUs to purchase specified amounts of renewable
 energy.
