 
 Mike Grigsby and I wish to recommend Scott Freeman for the October 29th trading track interviews.  Scott has accepted an analyst position with Enron and will be starting full-time in January, however, he worked as an intern this past summer with West-Power Trading in Portland and comes highly recommended.
 
 Scott's phone number is 512-294-7692.  Please let me know if you anything else from us.
 
 Thanks,
 Keith Holst
