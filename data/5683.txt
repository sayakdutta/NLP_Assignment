  >AP. A Texas A&M University student who claimed he had been raped by
 a dog
  >was yesterday jailed for 12 months.
  >
  >Martin Hoyle, 20, was arrested by police after the passengers of a
 passing
  >car witnessed a Bull Terrier, called Badger, having sex with Hoyle
 on the
  >side of Highway 290, just north of Hempstead.
  >
  >Assistent District Attorney Ben Crossland said the passengers of
 the car,
 an
  >unidentified couple from Houston, had stopped to help because they
 thought
  >Hoyle was being attacked by the animal.  But when they got closer
 they saw
  >that Hoyle had his pants around his ankles, was down on all fours,
 and the
  >dog was straddling him from behind.
  >
  >"The defendant mumbled something about the dog having taken a
 liking to
  >him," said Mr Crossland."The couple were extremely offended and
 sickened by
  >what they saw." Another individual in a passing car contacted
 police on a
  >cellular phone and Hoyle was arrested as he walked with the dog on
 the
  >feeder road.
  >
  >Hoyle, of College Station, told police "I can't help it if the dog
 took a
  >liking to me.He tried to rape me." He repeated the rape allegation
 at
  >the police station and added, "The dog pulled my jeans down."
  >
  >Hoyle, who has been arrested several times on alcohol-related
 charges, was
  >jailed for 12 months after he admitted committing an act that
 outraged
  >public decency. His lawyer said Hoyle had no memory of the incident
 because
  >of his intoxicated state, but was now very remorseful and
 incredibly
  >embarrassed.
  >
  >Jailing him, Judge Alistair McCallum told Hoyle "Never before in my
 time at
  >the bar or on the bench have I ever had to deal with somebody who
  >voluntarily allowed himself to be molested by a dog on the public
  >highway. Frankly it is beyond most of our comprehension. It is an
  >absolutely disgusting thing for members of the public to have to
 witness."
