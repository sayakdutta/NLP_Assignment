 Kaiser is up $10 myn on swaps and we control physical prior to payment on a 
 agent basis
 
 Large Metals Account for us

 Just a note on Kaiser, the agreement we have in place has terrible credit, 
 and Bill Bradford w/Credit refuses to trade under it.  We are in the process 
 of replacing it with another.

 Craig:
 
 Sorry I couldn't get back to you earlier.  I  asked Tana Jones to get you 
 access to our database that keeps track of financial master agreement 
 negotiations so you will always be up to date on where we stand with the 
 process.  If you haven't heard from her, please let me know.  Any word from 
 Justin on which Enron entity we will use for trading in the U.S.?
