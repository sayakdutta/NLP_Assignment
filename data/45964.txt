 
 Attached is the final version of the Enron Corp. Guaranty.  Unfortunately, 
 the ISDA Schedule is in the hands of Deutsche Bank and I need them to turn 
 around the revised draft.  I'm still working on it.

 Tana,
 
 Thanks for this.  It would be very helpful if you could send me the latest
 versions of the Guarantee and the Schedule just indicating which is the only
 outstanding point.  That way we can prepare the versions for EnronCredit.com
 Limited based on these and get things as close to finalised pending the
 outcome of this last credit point that you refer to.
 
 My fax number is 0207 330 9999.
 
 Many thanks for your assistance.
 
 Kind regards,
 
 Clare
 
 
     
 
 
 I bet you thought I forgot about you?!
 
 The lawyer up at Enron Corp. just called me and said he just got off the
 phone w/Deutsche Bank and they have come to an agreement as to the proposed
 form of guaranty.  We have one more credit issue on the master that Credit
 would like us to revisit with them, but otherwise I think we close to being
 done.  If you would like me to coordinate the execution of the guarantees
 you need with Enron Corp., I will be happy to assist you.

 Many thanks for the update.
 
 
     
 
 
 We just received what we hope is a final draft of the documents from
 Deutsche Bank, and I hope to respond back to you shortly, once I have had a
 chance to confirm they made all the changes.

 Many thanks. Apologies for the error, I obtained Tana's e-mail details from
 someone at Enron in London and they had misspelled it for me.
 
 Thanks again for all your help.

 Clare,
 
 Thanks for your note.  Your e-mail trouble is due to the spelling of Tana's
 name - should only be one 'n.'  I am forwarding this on to her.
