 Attached is a draft Response on behalf of the Committee to the Debtor's
 Motion for Relief from the Automatic Stay.  As I do not yet have the US
 Trustee's notice of appointment or a contact list, I did not have the
 complete names of each of the members.  Please email those to me along with
 your comments.
 
 I would like to send the Response to Judge Smith this afternoon, if
 possible, which means that it needs to be completed by 1:30.  Please forward
 your comments by that time.  Sorry for the short fuse.
 
 In addition, please send me your suggestions for counsel and for the agenda
 items for the meeting on March 28, which will follow the hearing that starts
 at 930 am.
