  The GTC is okay to send out for this deal; however, please note the change 
 that must be made to the Delivery Point for this deal.  Call if you have any 
 questions.
  In the future please advise Barbara Gray of any supply deals at points where 
 an interconnection with HPL is possible, excluding EOL transactions of less 
 than one month.
