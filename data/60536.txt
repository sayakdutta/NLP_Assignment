 
 Not really enough detail on specific areas where they are crossing territory.
 
 We know they are talking to munis but are they talking to utilities? We need names etc.
 
 Split the list into areas
 
 Industrials in our SIC codes
 
 Utilities
 
 Munis
 
 Thanks
 
  
     
 Louise,
 
 Attached is the list I have collected so far. Please let me know if this is what you need.
 
 I think the attached substantiates two issues:
 
 1) EES is approaching utilities and other wholesale entities (and they are being quite up-front about this)
 
 2) EES is approaching industrials which fall within ENA SIC codes.

 Get the specifics we are organizing a meeting - need written examples - could you pleae co-ordinate a full list across gas and power.
 
 Thanks
 
 
  
     
 
 Examples of EES working in ENA territory seem to keep coming.
 
 Anything further on this?
