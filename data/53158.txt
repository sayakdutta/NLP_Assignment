 Maureen:  I am sorry for the delay in getting back to you.  Shirley did send me a hard copy of his resume, and I have been trying to reach him.  However, he has recently finished school and moved, so neither his email (at Johns Hopkins) nor his home phone number were correct.  I finally reached an old roommate last night who gave me Dan's cell phone number.  I left a message, and he emailed me late this afternoon with his new address and phone number.  I'll give him a call tomorrow, see what his availability is for interviews, and get back with you with the information.

 Molly, 
 
 Thanks for your help. I'm sure Vince Kaminski would like to be involved.  I would also like to be included in the interviews as well Gwyn Koepke.  I'm not sure who else.  Maybe Shirley arrange with Vince who else he has in mind.
 
 Thanks, 
 
 Maureen

 Also, does anyone have an electronic copy of his resume you could send me?  If not, does someone have a hard copy? 
 
 Thanks,

 Molly, 
 
 Vince interviewed Daniel Bray today and would like to invite him to Houston.  He can be reached at (202) 213-3803.  Please let me know if you need any other information.
 
 Thanks for you assistance in this matter. 
 
 Sincerely,
