 Tana,
 
 I have received the quote for the new files for your area.  The 5-drawer 
 files are $682 each and the 2-drawers are $362 each for a total of $5,948 
 (includes tax).  If you want me to proceed with the order, please send me an 
 authorizing email.  Also, I still need to know how you would like the 
 cabinets to be keyed: all alike, split by banks (by groups) or individually, 
 or a combination of the last two options.  I can submit this purchase order 
 now without this information, but will need that shortly.
 
 I will be out of May 26-28, so if you have any questions, please contact Pat 
 Scarborough (x35368).
 
 Robin
