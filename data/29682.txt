 
 I noticed that for construction and cost overruns you inserted the words 
 "Must Complete" even if we sell EPE or in the case of Petrobras alll of the 
 project.  Is it your view that the gas suppliers will not consider 
 participating in any overrun support?

 Rob - I reviewed this matrix - I added some of my thoughts into the attached 
 matrix below.
 
 Our goal is to get as much of Enron's money out as soon as we can.  How we do 
 that is the difficult part and complex decision tree.  We don't have any idea 
 at this point in time which course of action is likely to be successful - so 
 we can not base our next step with Furnas (assuming tuesday's meeting with 
 Furnas is unproductive) on which of those paths we take.   I was hopeful we 
 could pursue an arbitration course or some other course with Furnas, to 
 increase the pressue - possible get a favorable outcome, and provide 
 political ramifications - and retain our other course of actions by being 
 able to stop the arbitration when it is opportune time to begin our final 
 push (after gas arrives).
 
 
 
 We need to be close to final decision on what we do next with Furnas on 
 wednesday.  John and Rob - please make sure we know if and what we can 
 arbitrate on Wednesday, and lets also make sure we have assessed  all other 
 possible/feasible next steps with Furnas ahead of Wednesday.
 
 Thanks
 
 Pete
