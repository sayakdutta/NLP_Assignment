 
 John,
  I believe that the schedule is self explanatory and no letter needs to be 
 provided.

 As you are aware, Franklin Adkins has removeed his meters from ENA effective 
 February 1, 2001.  Mr. Adkins has a fixed price, firm deal with ENA  for 

 has breached his contract with ENA by pulling his meters 2 months before the 
 end of the contract.
 
 Attached you will find a schedule calculating what we owe Mr. Adkins for 
 January 2001 Actuals, LESS the contractual commitments for February and March 
 2001.
 
 Should a letter as well as this schedule be sent to Mr. Adkins explaining 
 that ENA is reducing his January payment by the February and March 
 commitment?  If so, would you write the letter?
 
 
 John
