 
 We'll need the headcount for commercial people and I know Legal want their assistants.  Hire them as contractors through an agency
 
  
     
 Not sure if we had room in the 12 open positions or if we were able to add headcount at this point (I believe we added an admin spot in legal).  I will verify with David.
 
  
     
 
 
 Where do we get the headcount room from?
 
  
     
 Louise, 
 
 The following  employees currently working on the floor but have not received offers from UBS and are still on the estate payroll
 
 Amy Shewster (sp?)-receptionist.  She is needed not only to direct and answer calls but for security purposes.
 Jessie Villareal-clerk/runner.  Jessie is the only clerk on the floor and is apparently filling a very vital role.  T Jae Black (power), Ina Rangel (gas) and Liz all agree that we need him long term.  
 
 We have two options:
 1.  Leave them on estate payroll and ask for them to be seconded to UBS for a period of time
 2.  Give them UBS offers-I would need to do this tomorrow morning in order to get in before deal close.
 
 Let me know what you would like to do.  Thanks much.
