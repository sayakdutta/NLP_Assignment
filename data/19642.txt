 I plan (at this point) to be in New York until the morning of the 14th.  Maybe we need to stretch out this meeting while the company catches its wind.

 Brad:  Lot of water under the bridge since the 25th, but I just got a note from Perfect.  They're still planning on being in Houston to meet on the afternoon of the 13th.  Let me know if anything's changed and I'll get you the information on Perfect ASAP.  Thanks.

 The 13th would work much better, preferably in the afternoon.  Please contact Lydia Cannon (713-853-4893) to get a specific time on my calendar.  Also, any specific Perfect company information beforehand would be helpful.
 
 Thanks,
 Brad
 
  
     
 How do the 13th or 20th of November work?
 
  
     
 The 15th is Enron's Management Conference and the 22nd is Thanksgiving.  Any other dates?
 
  
     
 Hi Brad:
 I finally got in touch with the people from Perfect.  They'll be in Houston on the 15th and the 22nd of November.  Either of those days work for you?  If so, any time preference?
 
 Best,
 Jeff
