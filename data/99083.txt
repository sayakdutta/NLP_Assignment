 Richard,
  I have been working with Jeff Richter to solve some of the issues
 concerning the bid data and questions that have arisen about the outcome
 information we have already turned over to the experts.  Based upon a
 conversation that I had with Jeff this morning, I believe it makes sense for
 me to meet with Jeff in Portland to try and solve some of these problems.  I
 want to avoid creating multiple databases and both Jeff and I believe it
 will be easier to resolve these issues with both the people and the
 information at his fingertips.  I am also scheduled to meet with the
 Portland General traders on Wednesday to do the audit of their trading
 practices as we discussed when we were both last in Portland.  I also plan
 to spend a few minutes with Tim Belden to learn what additional information
 he might have about my understanding of the trading practices.  If you need
 more details, please let me know.
 
  Hope you had a pleasant 3 day weekend.
 
 Thanks
 Gary
