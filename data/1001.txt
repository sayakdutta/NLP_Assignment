 Phillip,
 
 I got this request.  On the gas side, I think Kean/Lay need an update to a table you prepared for me a few months ago, which I've attached..  Can you oblige?  Thanks,
 
 Alan Comnes

 Alan,
 
 Steve has asked that you update the power point below so that it reflects all of the "stupid regulatory/legislative decisions" since the beginning of the year.  Ken wants to have this updated chart in his briefing book for next week's "Ken Lay Tour" to CA.  
 
 He also wants a forward price curve for both gas and power in CA.  Can we get these three documents by Monday afternoon?
