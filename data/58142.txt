 
 I would like to see research from all of these sources on areas of interest 
 to enron -- energy and broadband, North America and Europe.  Thanks
 
 
 
 

 
  
  
  
 
 Attached are two research reports that I can send to you on a daily basis. 
 One of our many benefits here at our new location is the availability of 
 various research sources. The two reports I have attached are from :
 The First Union Securities Equity Marketing Group
 and
 Merrill Lynch
 We also have access to Goldman Sachs research, and CS First Boston Research. 
 Please let me know if you would like me to continue sending these reports on 
 a daily basis, or if you have any particular companies that you are 
 interested in hearing about.
 
 Sincerely,
 Hank Emery
