 Here's the bill of sale I promised to you.  Why don't you arrange a call/mtg 
 with Rose and me to discuss form of notice/information.  We should probably 
 start with the WestLB Purchase Option Assignment and Assumption form and 
 redraft it to include what we want and think the bank will require in 
 addition to what they asked for.

 And here is the bill of sale, also opened and saved on our system. If Mike 
 had a more recent version of this I don't think we got it. - KW
