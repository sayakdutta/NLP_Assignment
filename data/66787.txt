 Michelle,
 
 A few months ago, TW Marketing and Fac. Planning had a meeting to discuss TW CAS system issues. At this meeting, you indicated that the TW Marketers would like to have some training on CAS. I have discussed with Perry Frazier & he would like to set up 30 minute one on one hands-on training sessions with each individual. 
 
 Can you coordinate with your team & identify a list of TW Marketer's who would like to have CAS training? I will work with Perry to schedule the training times.
 
 Thanks Ramona
