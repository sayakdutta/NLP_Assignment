 Honey, I think we discussed C T Systems doing the filing.  Do you recall how 
 much it was?  If not, I can see what I can find out.
 
 Which is more strange: Joe in Central America or Jack in Egypt?  Clark in 
 Chicago?  Kay at Enron?  Gerry BUYING an engineering company?  Honey STILL at 
 Technip?
 
 Sounds like a great time for a reunion.

 Hello ladies.
 
 I have the signed original (all parnters have signed) of the going out of
 business documents for Anglers.  What is next?
 
 Honey, Kay seems to think there is one more form of some kind, plus a filing
 fee.  What do you know about those items?  I'm ready to make a final
 distribution and let you close out the account.  I'll be happy to deliver
 these papers to whomever is the appropriate person, agencey, etc. and help
 in any way to stop the insanity.
 Can we obtain the final cost for filing the papers, keep that in cash and
 make the final checks out?
 
 My Anglers papers show the following percentages, just in case you've gotten
 rid of your files:
 
 Alves         21.775
 Ashworth        4.265
 Bailey         10.895
 Dill         10.895
 Lockwood      15.235
 Mann           4.265
 Napoli         10.895
 Turner         21.775
 
 And......Kay, before you start making some smart ...comments,  I don't need
 the money and in fact I'll buy the first and last bottle of Krug if we can
 get together for a final distribution ceremony.
 
 As I always tell Dill (a.k.a. Mokhtar, his new Egyptian
 nickname).......Praise Allah.
