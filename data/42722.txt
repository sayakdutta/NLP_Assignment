 Nelson & John,
 
 Terry Franklin has prepared an Appalachian Estimated TCo Metered Production for Nov 01 schedule which she will provide you.  This represents our attempt at calculating the origination dollars (at TCo Index + 1/4 cent) attributable to the TCo Metered Production.
 
 I'm not exactly sure how to create a transfer from John Hodge's book to the Wellhead book for these dollars ($14,981).
 
 Terry will also provide the same format to capture DTI metered production origination.
