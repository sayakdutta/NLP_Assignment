 Mike-
 
 Ok, got the fax.
 
 Just got an email from your counter part for tonight's meeting. He needs to 
 cancel. He just left the office and went home sick. I called his assistant 
 to get a new date and time, but he has already gone home ill for the day.
 
 Email me back to confirm that you got this. Also, what is your schedule 
 like for Thurs, Fri, or over the weekend to reschedule the meeting.
