 Jeff --
 
 As always, your proposal is creative.  After reviewing your presentation,
 here are some tough questions that we can discuss tomorrow:
 
 1.    Would the replacement energy from the market be obtained under
 contracts of similar length and firmness as the QF contracts that the energy
 replaces?  If not, why would the CPUC want to replace long-term, committed
 QF power with short-term firm energy?
 
 2.    Why would the CPUC want to replace long-term QF power over which it
 has substantial regulatory leverage (through SRAC pricing) with market
 energy from sources over which it may have less control?
 
 3.    Are there 8,000 MWs of low-cost replacement energy available in
 California, or in the WSCC with firm transmission to California?  How steep
 is the supply curve for replacement energy?
 
 4.    After a QF is bought out, I assume that it would simply operate in the
 electric market as a merchant plant, if it continues to operate to provide
 on-site power and thermal energy.  Is this correct?
 
 5.    How sensitive are your calculated ratepayer and QF benefits to changes
 in the relationship between SRAC (i.e. gas) and electric market prices?
 
 6.    Assuming that there are both ratepayer and QF benefits from QF
 contract buyouts, why is there a need for a formalized auction process, when
 the same benefits might be captured through bilateral negotiations (such as
 the QF buyouts done to date)?
 
 7.    Doesn't your proposal require the utilities to be back in the power
 procurement business?  If not, why not?
 
 As you perhaps can tell, my questions focus on whether now is the right time
 for such a broad plan to buyout QF contracts.
 
 Talk to you tomorrow,
 
 Tom
 
 
     
 
 
 Tom:
 Here's the presentation that we'll go over with you tomorrow.
 If you have any questions between now and then, just give me a call at
 415.782.7822.
 What number should I call you at tomorrow?
 
 Best,
