 out in his email.  Also, we have about a 5 year old Local Currency ISDA in 
 Place with them, so we could put the trades under that master.  I don't know 
 if we want to upgrade the master at this time, or just stay where we are.  He 
 said we didn't have a master w/Apache, but when entered my notes into lotus 
 notes I noticed we did.  I called him back, he didn't know ERMS was the same 
 as ENA.

 Apache is investment grade, but they are not bank quality.  In actuality, I 
 think they are about the same quality as Fletcher, regardless of Saul's 
 comments.  What is the purpose of the Shell for a day transaction?
 
 
 
     
 Per a conversation I just had with Saul Laureles, an attorney with 
 Chamberlain, Hrdlicka, who has been hired to assist Apache/Shell with the 
 assignment of the Fletcher Challenge business.  He said:
 
 Fletcher Challenge would like to assign their petro business to Shell 
 Holdings for a short time (like one day or so).  Shell would then immediately 
 transfer the agreement/transactions to Apache.  He proposes we get a new 
 master in place with Apache, since Apache is a better credit than Fletcher 
 Challenge.  He said he will send me some letter showing how he would like to 
 do this, along with a draft Apache ISDA (without collateral, of course, since 
 Apache is such a good credit).  I told him that I can't speak for Credit, but 
 we probably are going to have a big problem on that last point.  We never 
 enter into masters without a collateral annex attached.  
 
 I'll keep you posted when I hear from him.
