 to weather the afternoon storm! Let me know what works for you.

 P.S. I hope you had a great birthday party on Saturday! I wanted to make it, 
 but ended up on a terribly boring date instead. Go figure.

 Hey Kate-
 I'd be interested in talking to you more about Deal Control.  Let me know if 
 you want to grab a coffee or lunch sometime soon.
 Thanks!
 Em

 No problem! That's very sweet of you to thank me, though. It was my pleasure.

 Dear Kate,
 
 Thank you for allowing me the opportunity to job shadow with you in Deal 
 Control.  I loved your metaphor for the wheels of the clock and how all the 
 cogs in the wheels need to match up.  I also enjoyed seeing how "scraps" are 
 used and that there is trading between desks within Enron.  You do such a 
 great job at being in the moment and keeping your cool when new tasks come 
 your way throughout the day.  Your time and patience in answering my 
 questions and helping me understand how it all fits together is much 
 appreciated.
 
 With gratitude,
 Emily
