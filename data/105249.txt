 I have not seen any Enron Corp./CSFB agreements.
 
 ENA has two different agreements with CSFB:
 
 (1)  ISDA dated4/21/93.  This had:  NY law, submission to non-exclusive 
 jurisdiction of NY courts/waiver of objections to venue, limitation of 
 liability
 
 (2)  Futures Agreement dated 9/21/00.  This had:  NY law, arbitration, 
 limitation of liability
