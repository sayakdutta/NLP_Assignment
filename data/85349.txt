 swamped.  I am thinking the South Carolina game works.  However, what does a 
 flight to Florida cost?  I need to factor that in as well, as I am planning 
 on going to Spain in November and probably need to watch my $$$.    
 
 I have been to several OU games in Dallas, and it is actually more fun than 
 the A&M game because they split the stadium 50/50 Texas OU.  It is pretty 
 intense.  I am trying to get tickets to the game this year and will probably 
 go.

 Okay, here's the rest of the Gators' home schedule and the Longhorns' schedule
 for comparison.
 
           Gators              Longhorns
 Oct 7          LSU            Oklahoma in Dallas
 Oct 14         Auburn              at Colorado
 Nov 11         South Carolina      at Kansas
 
 Do you go to the game Oklahoma game in Dallas?  I went one year and it was a 
 lot
 of fun.
 
 So, if you have any desire to do this swap, let me know.
