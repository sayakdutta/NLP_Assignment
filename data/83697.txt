 Scott-
  Hey there, this is Chris Graeter.  I wanted to check with you to see about
 getting in touch with the person in charge of internships.  I am sure he or
 she is busy, but in the mean time I was not sure if you or the person who

 know that sometimes it is easier to get in touch with someone by email so I
 wanted to make sure you had this information.  Thank you again for all your
 assistance.  I hope to talk to you soon.
 
 Sincerely,
 Chris Graeter
