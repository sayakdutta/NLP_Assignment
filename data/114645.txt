 
 Geir Solberg in Real Time is fixing this right now - I'll let you know the 
 new deal number in just a second.
 
 Thanks,

 Can you kill this deal or zero out the volumes?  thanks.

 I just spoke with Jesse Bryson in Real Time, and he said this should actually 
 be 2 buy-resales - one from Four Corners to ZP-26, and one from ZP-26 to 
 NP-15. Let me know how that sounds to you, and I'll enter the deals.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate

 Should this be NCPA, since we do not have transmission with them.  Or maybe 
 it should be a buy/resale.  let me know.  Thanks.
