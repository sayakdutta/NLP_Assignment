 
 You guys have probably already noodled on this, but if you haven't, maybe it's worth organizing a meeting next week to discuss the above storage project and benefits / risks to TW.
 
 For instance:
 
 Risks:
 Red Lake connection to Kern cuts into TW forward haul market
 
 
 Rewards:
 expands TW's Park n' Ride capabilities (we offer more capability and back it with a storage position)
 better PnR rates over the short term than what the storage can offer
 more backhaul business on TW mainline (i.e. Citizens Utilities)
 Compression ops agrmt w/ Aquila
 
 
 Let me know if you'd like to get together for a brainstorm session.  Bids are due to Aquila by 3/15 and there are some financial caveats to discuss.
