 
 Good idea.  Thanks.  Yes, I'm around.
 
  
     
 You're just aiming to pick a fight w/ Freeman!!  One point I would really hit home after saying that an inexperienced buyer, DWR, was buying power for the state, is that the amount of debt incurred by the state -- that will now have to be burdened by ALL residents -- has thrown California into financial peril, depleting reserves, taking $$ away from education, etc., for at least the next two decades.
 
 You around today?  I still need to talk to you.

 On October 4th, I'll be trying to fill Rob Bradley's rather large shoes at the Cal State University Center for California Studies' 13th annual envisioning California conference, "Our Year of Disconnect:  The Politics of Power in California."
 
 I'll be participating in a Roundtable at the plenary session entitled: "Lessons Learned, Unlearned & To Be Learned:  A Roundtable on California's Utility Deregulation."
 
 The Roundtable will be moderated by the State Librarian, Kevin Starr.  The other roundtable-ists include:
 
 Chuck Cicchetti (Edison plant?  Anyone know what he's up to these days?)
 Bob Foster--Edison
 Nettie Hoge--head of TURN
 Glen Thomas--Chair of the Pennsylvania PUC (any info on Chair Thomas is appreciated)
 State Senator Debra Bowen
 David Freeman--Self-appointed emporer
 Dr. Joseph Pratt--History prof., University of Houston (any info on the professor is also appreciated)
 
 Each of us will have two minutes to open and then Dr. Starr will moderate the ensuing mud-slinging.
 
 Attached are some draft talking points that I threw together for your review.  All comments, suggestions, guffaws, etc. are welcome and appreciated.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
