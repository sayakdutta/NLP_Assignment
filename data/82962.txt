 Nelson,
 
 I have booked the TDC deal for the remainder of the term.  It is now in the 
 Gulf3 book at Tenn/Zone1.  If locations need to change, and I'm sure they 
 will, please let me know and I will make sure it is hedged correctly.  
 
 sitara #778201
 
 also,  if you could use the same sitara number every month for the central 
 gas it would help make our reconciliation process much smoother.
 
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kam
