 As I mentioned in my voice-mail, this needs to go somewhere that users might 
 actually see it - e.g. a news ticker story.  Simply adding it to the Legal & 
 Privacy Statement, while helpful, is not sufficient.
 
 
 
 
 EnronOnline is conducting a pilot program involving direct access connections 
 (such as a "T1" line or other means of direct access) to EnronOnline, as an 
 alternative to internet access.   Direct access connections might enable 
 users to access EnronOnline more quickly than is currently possible through 
 internet access.
