 
 Wei,
 
 I am showing a position for the book id listed below when I query RMS Open 
 Positions, but I don't see the positions when I query Benchmark Agg_View.   
 Can you refresh the table to see if this position will pull into the 
 Benchmark Agg_View table?  I am including the book id, post id, and position 
 from yesterday.  Let me know if you need any more information.

 Thanks,
