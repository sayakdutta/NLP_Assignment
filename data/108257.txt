 Jeff,
 Thanks for agreeing to participate in the Super Saturday on November 11th.  
 Your speech should be about 10-15 minutes and begins at 7:50 at the Hyatt 
 Hotel.  The interviews are from 8:45 until 12:30.  The decision-making 
 meeting starts at 1:15 pm.  
 
 I will meet with you on Thursday or Friday to review the format etc.  I am 
 out of the office until Wednesday.  Please leave me a message about whether 
 Thursday or Friday is better for you.  Thanks
 Charlene x 3-9523
