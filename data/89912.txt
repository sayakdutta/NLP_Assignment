 
 With respect to Narsima, I agree with Rogers.  With respect to Steve Wang and Guatum Gupta, please work directly with Harry and Dana.   I am continuing to push responsibility down to the desk heads and that includes personnel issues.
 
 Thanks.

 Kevin, Louise was not comfortable on the contract numbers proposed for Gupta, Wang and Broderick.
 
 She feels that it is not necessary to revise Broderick yet as his contract is not up until 4/30/02 and felt the numbers were too rich for Gupta and Wang.  When are you available to rework the numbers or do you want to speak to her about it first?  I know Dana is very anxious to get an agreement to Goutam.
 
 
 Also, I spoke to Rogers last week to follow up on Narsima.  He wanted to change the signing cash to 30k and do away with the retention.  I suggested maybe increasing cash to 20k and 20k in equity and told him that since he was promoted to manager as Don and Juan, Louise may feel that we need to keep all packages consistent.  Rogers felt that there is a considerable distinction between Narsima and Don and Juan and thought would be able to sell this to Louise.  What are your thoughts?
