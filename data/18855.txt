 on the QF issues in California because the terrain has changed considerably 
 in CA.

 Jeff & Paul --
 
 Let's make sure that we know how this information is being used by the 
 commercial people.  I'm always worried about sending out % estimates of 
 future regulatory outcomes because these opinions frequently become "fact".

 Mike:
 Here's the memo on PX-based pricing for QFs that we discussed.  If you have 
 any questions, don't hestitate to get in touch.
 
 Best,
