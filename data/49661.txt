 
 Paul,
 
 Sorry for the late notice. Please, let me know when you are coming to Houston.
 
 I shall be again in London sometimes in November.
 
 Vince
 
 
 
 
 

    
 
 
 
 I would very much like to meet Vince, unfortunately I am in back to back
 meetings all day today.  Maybe we could rearrange next time Vince is in London
 or I am in Houston.
 
 Regards
 
 PAUL

 I am so sorry for the late notice, but Vince will be in London for 1 day
 only,
 Monday, October 2nd.  He has had some time freed up and if Paul and
 Julian could meet with him, they can call him at the Grosvenor House,
 870-400-8500.  His morning is already full, but lunch, dinner or afternoon
 would work.
 
 Regards,
 
 Shirley
