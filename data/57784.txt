 It has come to my attention that there has been some confusion regarding the 
 Lobbying Questionnaire that I sent out on Feb. 20, 2001 and which is due on 
 March 9, 2001.  Please note that it is NOT necessary to gather your expenses 
 attributable to your lobbying activities rather I just need an allocation of 
 your time/hours spent engaging in such activity during the year 2000.  I 
 apologize for any confusion.  Thank you - Tara Rafter
