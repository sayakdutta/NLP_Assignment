 Goodmorning Vince ,
 
 We added a bookcase to the conference room on the 19th floor
 however ,due to the departments growth I think we could use
 another one.
 
 Vince , in the long run it would save us some time.
 
 Please let me know if this is okay!
 
                                                                           
 Thanks 
                                                                       Kevin
