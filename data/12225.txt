 
 Max, I spoke to Pete Metzner of METRIC Corporation about the status of the 
 environmental assessment you need for the above project and he said that he 
 has received the packet you sent him but he needs to have additional 
 clearification on some items which are pertinant for completing the EA.  Mr. 
 Metzner was concerned that he would not be able to complete the EA by the 
 specified time unless he discussed these issues with you.  METRIC has 
 extensive experience with environmental assessments, but is not familiar with 
 pipeline terminology and pipeline actions proposed uder the agreement with 
 the Office of Pipeline Safety.
 
 When you get a chance, would you please contact Pete at (505) 828-2801.
 
 Thanks.
