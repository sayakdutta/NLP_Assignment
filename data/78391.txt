 Congrats on the ride.  Are you standing up at your desk today?
 
 
    
  
 Kay,  I made it through the MS150 alive and kicking. I even rode with Jeff 
 for a few miles.
 
 How are the comments flowing in?  I have not seen anything form anyone.  
 Christi N. said she would be done this morning.  I'll be calling everyone 
 else to find out how they are doing.
