 I spoke with Mark about the Federal law issue and we both feel that our 
 exposure is no greater than what it would be if we traded over the phone with 
 this counterparty.  Because they are a federal agency, there is no way around 
 this issue other than to not permit them to trade with us online.

 Carol,
 
 - Do we really want to accept arbitration in Portland?
 - What is our exposure to Federal Law?

 David:
 Enclosed for your review is a draft amendment letter for the above 
 counterparty.  All of the requested chnages are driven by the fact that BPA 
 is a federal agency.  I look forward to hearing from you.
