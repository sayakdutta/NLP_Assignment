 flowing volumes for May, you need to decrease the total volume at Hastings by 
 3000 dth.  I will try to remind you.  
 
 Kim, please send me an AMTEL at 1:00pm on 4/24/2000  "REMIND ANGIE TO REDUCE 
 HASTINGS BY 3,000 FOR MAY"

 Can you tell me which pools this impacts and how much by pool (hastings, 
 Bridgeport ...)
 
 
 

   
 FYI.  I received a letter today from Ed Arnold with Kriscott Inc. stating 
 that they will be terminating their CNG gas contract effective 5/1/2000.  For 
 volume purposes, his four meters produced about 3,000 dths a month.  Let me 
 know if anyone wants a copy of the letter.
 
 Thanks,
 HG
