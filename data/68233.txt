IT fixed the curves and Burton fixed them on his side, the VaR should be virtually nonexistent.  I am also noticing a high VaR for Virawan Yawaponsiri, can you also run one on hers please.  Sorry to continue to bother you with this, Jeff Gossett just wants this resolved ASAP.  Thanks.

  Bharat ,
  I've done the mapping of omicron but you need to contact book administrators to do the sec-prim. mapping as I don't have permission to do that.
 
  Thanks.
