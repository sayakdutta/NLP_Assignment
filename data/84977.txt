 
 Attached is the form of Amendment to the Gas Conversion Agreement that was 
 executed by TW on Friday.  The Amendment does the following:
 
  1.  Shifts gas flow delivery to commence upon the Start Date instead of the 
 2 month lag.
  2.  Deems the Start Date for all operational documents with TW to be May 1, 
 2000 regardless of when physical start up occurs.
