 
 Sugarbooger,
 
 Looks like Continental is our best bet at $620 per ticket, which I'm assuming 
 reflects the beginning of the official high season in C.R.  American is 
 slightly lower but you have to go THRU MIAMI!  Ick!
 There is a 9:30 a.m. out of Houston on 12/9 and the return trip from San Jose 
 is at 8:10 a.m. (a 3 p.m. was also available).
 They're holding the tickets for us; if we want them, we have to decide before 
 COB tomorrow.
 
 Muchos besos!
