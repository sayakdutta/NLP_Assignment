 
 Dear Richard,
 
 I am delighted that you will be joining us in Capri in September.  I am 
 confident that you will enjoy the discussions, and I certainly look forward 
 to hearing your perspectives.
 
 Within the next few weeks, you will receive the formal invitation along with 
 more detailed information regarding the agenda, attendees and 
 accommodations.  Should you have any questions or need additional information 
 in the meantime, please do not hesitate to call me or my assistant, Sherri 
 Sera, at 713.853.5984.
 
 Regards,
 Jeff Skilling
