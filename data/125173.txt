 
 You didn't answer if you would clean more or less boats this year than the last guy.
 
 And yes, I am with Beth.
 
 And yes, I am still a stud-cowboy.
 
  
     
 I don't clean boats damnit. I manufacture them from powder form
 polyethelene. I bake them in big rotating ovens. It's pretty damn cool. Tara
 is 95% sure she is returning. Notice how I answer all of the questions you
 asked.
 
 
     
 
 So Tara is definitely returning?
 
 Is this job the new boating equivalent of your UH recruiting job?
 Where you will clean less boats this year than anyone else in
 your position in the history of Triumph Boats?
 
 BTW, I have paid much more than $185 for a raw, water washdown, man-whore.
 
     
                 
    By Dec. 1 or Dec. 31, I forget. Her start date is Aug. 5th. I could give
    you
    a raw water washdown, but I'd have to charge you $185.
 
    
                 
 
    So when does Tara have to commit to Big E?
 
    Can you clean my boat? It has this crusty, fishy stuff on the bottom of
    the
    hull.
 
        
                             
       No dillweed. Just building them. Tara got her offer from Enron. It's
       pretty
       nice. Are you still working 547 hours per week?
 
       
                             
 
       Cards win indeed. I like them for the series.
       Are you cleaning fishing boats, too?
 
 
 
 
           
                                         
          Hey there cheese dick. How's life in H-Town? This is my new work
       e-mail.
          I'm
          doing accounting work at this boat manufacturer. If you're in the
       market
          for
          a nice fishing boat you let me know. Capron filled me in on your
       quest
          for a
          Vegas trip. Doesn't look good. Due to my recent bout of
    unemployment,
       I
          don't think gambling would be a good use of my available fundage.
       Tara
          and I
          will be in Houston Nov. 15th thru 18th for Curry's wedding. Plan
    on
          throwing
          back a few that weekend when we get some spare time. Are you and
    Beth
          together or apart at this time? I really could just flip a coin
    and
       get
          as
          accurate an answer as you would give me, huh? Take it easy hombre.
    Go
          Cards!
