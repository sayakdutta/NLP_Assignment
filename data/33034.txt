 
 I'm available. 
 
  
     
 Good morning-
 
 Can we get together tomorrow afternoon to go through recent developments in the Tetco and Sonat 637 cases, and the Transco rate case?  Other than Bob's staff meeting from 2-3, I'm clear all afternoon so please let me know if you're free.
 
 Is there anyone else over there I should invite?
 
 Thanks
 Suzanne
