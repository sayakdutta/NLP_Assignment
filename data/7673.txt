 Leave room for the pie!  Let's review calendars so that we can pin point a 
 time for you or you and Chris to visit.  ( I will keep that date 
 confidential, so that it will be reserved for you.)  --Sally 
 
 
 
 

    
 
 Yes, it's good to have my hubby back!   Am going to Wharton tomorrow to meet
 with Trav - as far as we can tell, the Wharton County Tennis Assoc. is the
 oldest in the state and I'm going to write an article about them.  Hope all
 is well.  Hello to all!   Love, Cara
