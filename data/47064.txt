 
 Per my voicemail, it appears we sent a draft of an ISDA to Susan Pharr at 
 Select Energy in September of 2000.  Susan Bailey, a paralegal in our group, 
 worked on that master with Ed Sacks in our Credit Dept.  Susan's phone number 
 is (713) 853-4737 and Ed Sack's phone number is (713) 345-7712.  You might 
 want to contact Susan Pharr to get a copy of the ISDA.  If you can't find it 
 call Susan and she can get you another copy.
