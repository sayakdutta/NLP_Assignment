 e-mails, when he says "more realistic" numbers, I think he is talking to you. 
 I thought I heard that 1) Sterling's case was weak and 2) she has hired a 
 more reasonable atty.

 As you know there are a couple of pending litigation issues outstanding 
 (Waste Management, Lyon Credit/Hudson United Bank and Victoria Sterling).  
 Per conversations w/ Richard Sanders he suggests setting aside $25K each for 
 WMI and Lyon Credit.  Michelle suggested $250-300K for Sterling.
 
 Based on our cash available and expense projections these reserves bankrupted 
 us about two weeks ago!  I need further guidance on more realistic numbers.  
 We don't have much room to work here and every dollar is precious to keep the 
 lights on while we try and get this sale done.
