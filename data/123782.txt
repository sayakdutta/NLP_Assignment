 Please start the following task in the morning:
 
 Using the Official 11-30 calcs that you exported deal summaries from, add the following counterparty's MTM by desk:
 Constellation 
 Energy Authority
 Sempra Energy Trading
 Public Service of Colorado
 
 I believe the calc that identified our top-levels had extra transactions or values that did not fall out of our books.  Once you have figured out the total for the above counterparties compare them to your top-levels.
 
 Thanks,
 Stacey
