 Mark, further to our conversation... Mercado transacted with Enron North
 America under the terms and conditions of a financial transaction and these
 transactions have been or will be settled financially, however these
 transactions could have been set up as physical.  The structure of the
 transaction changes as a result of a few variables, including the price,day
 of cash settlement, and curtailment issues on San Jan deliveries which
 would then automatically convert the fixed price portion to 100% load
 factor and settlement would be on 100% of the volume regardless as to what
 physically flowed.
 
 Please call me if there are any questions regarding this note.

 Vice President, Enron North America
