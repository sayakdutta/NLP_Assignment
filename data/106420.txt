 Let's add these provisions and send off to George and Tanya.  There are 
 several blanks to be completed after everyone reviews.

 Sara,
 
 The confirms pulled in under an ENA Master Agreement (dated 9/1/94), not 
 under an
 ISDA Master Agreement, as Tanya was mentioning.   
 
 I looked in the Financial Trading Agreements database and confirmed the ENA 
 Master.
 
 After you've incorporated the changes, please send them back to me, because
 Derek is has to send them to George for his review, and then I'll fax them 
 out:
