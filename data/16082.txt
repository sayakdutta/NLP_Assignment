 We are getting considerable traction with the idea of using a "benchmark" to 
 judge utility purchases, similar in concept to what's in place on the gas 
 side.  To oversimplify it:  
 
 1) set the benchmark 
 2) the utility buys for consumers and tries to beat the benchmark 
 3) if (at the end of the year) the utility has beat the benchmark, it shares 
 the profits with consumers; if the benchmark wins, the utility shares the 
 losses with consumers 
 4) the PUC performs no "after-the-fact" reasonableness; no "second-guessing"
 
 California likes the idea and is now looking to Enron to come up with what 
 the benchmark ought to be.  I talked to Calger a bit about it today and he 
 suggested that I get together with you guys.  As always, time's short. Are 
 you available on Monday?
 
 Thanks,
 Jeff
