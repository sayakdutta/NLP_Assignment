 Perfect.  I forgot what year your son was.  Did he graduate with Chelsea and
 the Clintons?  Tons of Bay Area TV coverage of the Clinton graduation (with
 honors they said) from Stanford.  (How can you graduate with honors when you
 are traveling all over the world with mom and dad.)  Fortunately, they plan
 to be gone when you get here...lot less crowded.  I will look forward to
 hearing from Krishna via email or via cell phone at 650.218.3069.  Thanks
 very much for accelerating this and putting it on your agenda.

 Dale,
 
 I shall be in your part of the world on Friday (Palo Alto).
 I shall ask Krishna to meet you in my place.
