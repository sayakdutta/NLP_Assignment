 
 Just talked to Peevey.  He told me that he and Freeman personally worked with 
 Bilas on Bilas' draft decision--the decision designed to make CDWR 
 creditworthy and keep the PUC from touching Direct Access until the 
 Legislature has a chance to fix the AB1X prohibition.
 
 I made the pitch re: decision does what it takes to fix the creditworthy 
 issue and the Commission needs to vote it out immediately.  He said he agreed 
 but expressed his general frustration with the decision making process 
 generally, and said that he is not certain right now if the decision is 
 greased to get voted out at the next Commission meeting.
 
 He said that he's going to be talking to the Governor this afternoon and will 
 push the issue with him.  I asked him to keep me updated.  He said that he 
 would.
 
 I told him that it wasn't helpful that the Governor named names in New York 
 regarding alleged agreements about "haircuts," particularly when folks are 
 trying to negotiate deals with DWR. He wasn't aware of that and asked me to 
 fax him the Merril press, which I did.  I'll also fax him our letter 
 supporting the Bilas decision.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
