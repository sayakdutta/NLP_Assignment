 the call of duty, not only locating, copying and expediting the article to 
 me, but all within two days of my request. And it was for a good cause - 
 we'll be donating the proceeds from our holiday party/auction to the 
 Court-Appointed Special Advocates (CASA). Last year the proceeds went to 
 Emanuel Children's Hospital - $20,000 from auction attendees plus matching 
 dollars from Enron Corp. resulted in a hefty check.
 
 I'm sorry we didn't connect while you were in Portland. I got the message on 
 Monday and figured it was a little too late by then. Hope the reunion went 
 well. I'm scrambling to be svelte and successful by my 10-year high school 
 reunion, which descends upon me in less than four years. I know I'll need at 
 least that much time, having spent four years of my life with that bunch of 
 overachieving Catholic girls.
 
 I just had a surprise visit from some Ashland friends on Tuesday, replete 
 with an extra ticket to see Santana at the Rose Garden. What an awesome 
 concert! I must say I'm thoroughly enjoying city life again. But I'll need to 
 come to Ashland soon for a dose of good old-fashioned familiarity.
 
 So, I guess this was the long way of saying yes, I got the article, and thank 
 you so much for such indispensible help.
