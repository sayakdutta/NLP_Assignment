 
 Hi guys:
 
 I want you both to know that you should be totally embarrassed that the 48 year old fat guy found the web site on his own when you two could not!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
 The web site is:  www.boat-ed.com/tx/
 Ben get on it right away so that you can ride the wave runners by yourself!
 Its going to be fun.
 Congratulations on passing all of your classes.  
 
 See you in a couple of weeks!

 Hello.
 
 Good news!  Ben passed all of his classes...by the skin of his teeth, so he
 is able to come to Houston.  :)
 
 Ben and I both tried to find the web site about the wave runner license but
 were unsuccessful.  Were you able to ask your friends?  Ben is now very
 anxious to take the test so he can drive one of the wave runners.
 
 Love,
 Linda
