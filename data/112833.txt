 Seems that, at a minimum, ARM should join, if it doesn't already plan to.  And we should also consider joining ourselves, since it is low cost to do so, and pretty cost issue for our book.  Thoughts?

 ALJ Pulsifer  --  Pursuant to your instructions at today's PHC, this is to
 inform you and the parties that CLECA will file a Motion to Strike portions
 of the testimony of TURN witness Marcus and PG&E witness Kuga that address
 the creation of specific fees or charges on direct access customers.  That
 issue is specifically before Comm. Wood and ALJ Barnett in A.98-07-003 and
 it is not appropriately part of the inter-utility allocation of DWR costs
 that is the subject of this proceeding.  I believe that other customer
 groups will join CLECA in that filing, which we plan to make on Tuesday when
 the Commission opens for business.  William Booth
