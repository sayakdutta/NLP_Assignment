 Do you have a problem with me taking this to the prayer ministry tonight?
 
 
 
 




   
 
 I am writing to each of you because I need you to be in prayer with me
 this week.
 
 For the past two months, I have been going to the doctor, because of a
 lump I found
 under my arm.  As a result of that I have had to have a mammogram and an
 ultrasound of
 my breast.  Both test came back abnormal and  I am seeing a specialist
 this week to
 determine if I need to have a biopsy or not.
 
 Since God has given me the task of
 doing a mighty work for him the devil has been busy.
 
 I trust and believe that God will heal.  God gave me a revelation several
 months
 ago that ALL IS WELL since that time, my husband and I have reunited our
 family,
 we have been blessed tremendously in more ways than I can share with you
 at
 this time, however, in the midst of those blessings, the devil has gotten
 mad.  So he
 has decided to try and pull me down once again.  I refuse to be brought
 down off this
 spiritual high that is truly a blessing from God.
 
 That is why I am calling on all you prayer warriors
 I need you to be in prayer with me this week.  I see the specialist on
 Thursday
 and I will know then if I need to have the biopsy.
 
 God Bless Each of you
 and
 Season's Greetings
 
 Love
 
 Marylyn
