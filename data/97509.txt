 this am.

 Richard-
 
 We are currently nearing the end of our audit for EnSerCo, L.L.C. and 
 therefore we need to send out an internal legal representation letter.  I 
 know that you were the person who signed the letter last year and therefore I 
 was wondering if you could sign it for us this year as well.  If could let me 
 know, then I can bring this by to you Thursday morning for your signature.
 
 Thanks,
