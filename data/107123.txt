 (1)  Par. 5 - will we agree to a fee schedule now or "as agreed to from time to time"?
 
 (2)  Par. 7 - I have requested the interest rate schedule. Alternatively, I have "borrowed" language from the FIMAT USA, Inc. agreement.  Which do you think is best?
 
 (3)  Par. 8 - is the reference to CAD50,000 for speculative accounts alright?  Or will this be simply a hedge account and that particular language is extraneous?
 
 (4)  Par. 14 - will you need to object by phone (or is fax sufficient)?
