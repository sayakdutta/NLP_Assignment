  Preparation for Daylight Savings Time Transition 4/1/01
 
 
  Market Participants:
 
  Please assure that this information is forwarded to your respective
 Pre-Scheduling, Real Time Dispatch and Metering Operations!!!
 
  The transition to Daylight Savings Time is rapidly approaching.  In
 preparation ISO Market Operations has provided the following Scheduling
 Procedure to help assure a smooth transition.  The Scheduling Procedure is
 the same one used in 2000.
 
   CAISO Scheduling Procedure for Daylight Savings Time
 Transition
 
   The following is a brief explanation of how SC's should
 prepare schedules for submission to the CAISO Scheduling Infrastructure (SI)
 system for the upcoming conversion to Daylight Savings Time commencing on
 4/1/01.
 
   When submitting preferred or revised preferred schedules for
 Trade Date 4/1/01, which is considered a "Short" day because an hour is
 lost, SC's should  schedule all 24 hours of information with the data for
 HE03 being zeroed out in the template or blanked out when using the CAISO SI
 Web Workspace to submit schedules.
 
   The ISO's System Applications (SA) do not read or write data
 from/to the SI database for the "Short" day's HE03.  Therefore, no data will
 be sent to settlements for this hour.  Consequently, settlements will have
 only 23 records for this "Short" day, Trade Date 4/1/01.

   CAISO Metering Procedure for Daylight Savings Time
 Transition
 
   The ISO receives all Settlement Quality Meter Data (SQMD) in
 PST, year around.
 
   Therefore, the transition to DST should require no
 modification to meter data submission.
 
   However, please confirm and assure that all SQMD meter data
 continues to be submitted to ISO MDAS in PST.
 
   If you have additional ISO Metering questions for this trade
