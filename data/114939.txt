 
 I'm continuing to work with IT in Houston in an attempt to restore the EOL 
 Report to its former glory. They are making several changes to the report 
 which seem to result exponentially in glitches. As of right now the 
 application will not create any kind of file with any kind of data; hence the 
 absence of any kind of report. I will keep you informed of our progress.
 
 Thanks for your patience,
 Kate
