 Celebrity Cruise
 
 We at Carnival Cruise Lines didn't forget that a lot of entertainers
 had promised to leave the country if George W. Bush became President.
 With that in mind, we have a Special Offer for those who want to keep
 their promise!
 
 Attention: Would Alec Baldwin, Rosie O'Donnell, Cher, Phil Donahue, 
 David Gephin, Barbara Streisand, Pierre Salinger, and anyone else who 
 made that promise, please report to Florida for the sailing of the 
 Funship Cruise, "Elation," which has been commissioned to take you 
 to  your new homes outside of the USA. The Florida Supreme Court will 
 sponsor a  Farewell Parade in your honor through Palm Beach, Broward, 
 and Miami-Dade counties prior to your cruise.
 
 Please pack for an extended stay...at least four years and you should
 consider the possibility of eight years. Your captain is to be Bill 
 Clinton and your cruise director will be Al Gore. Monica Lewinsky will 
 be your recreation director. Ted Kennedy will act as lifeguard and 
 supervise swimming instruction. Mr. Kennedy will also be teaching a 
 course in emergency procedures. 
 
 Your spiritual advisor and marriage counselor will be the Rev. Jesse 
 Jackson. If you've any questions about making arrangements for your homes, 
 friends and loved ones, please direct your comments to Senator Hillary 
 Clinton.  Her village can raise your children while you're gone, and she 
 can watch over all your money and your furnishings until you return. 
 
 Bon Voyage!
