 The reason why your check went to Portland is because in 2000 the ISC created a US01 address for you so that you would receive your checks while you were in Portland.  I have gone into SAP and delimited your US01 address and you will receive your 10/15 check at your 2906 mail stop.

 Gwen,
 
 There have been problems with my paycheck going to the wrong address. It is still going in Portland, Oregon. Can you please change my mail stop to 2906?
 
 My current address is
 2440 North Boulevard # 5205
 Houston, TX 77098 
 
 and I changed this in the ehronline website. Can you reconfirm this? 
 
 Thanks,
 Monika Causholli
