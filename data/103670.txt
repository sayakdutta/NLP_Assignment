 
 I am a derivatives lawyer with ENA in Houston and obtained your name through 
 one of my traders who is transacting with Jay Carr in Houston (please see 
 attached message below).  When I spoke with Jay earlier this month, I asked 
 him for the name of a lawyer but was advised that all Vitol lawyers were in 
 New York and that he would pass my message along to a lawyer.  I am assuming 
 that you are the trading lawyer who can assist me with negotiating an ISDA 
 Master Agreement between our respective companies.  If not, please let me 
 know and feel free to pass this message on to the appropriate attorney.  On 
 April 12, 1995, Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp., predecessor in title 
 to ENA, and Vitol S.A., Inc. entered into a Master Agreement which is one of 
 ENA's early energy price swap agreements.  Since our companies are currently 
 trading weather derivatives, I think you would agree that it would be prudent 
 to supersede the existing agreement with an ISDA Master Agreement.  This 
 relates to my conversation with Jay in that we confirmed our weather deals 
 under the existing master but incorporated the 1991 and 1993 ISDA definitions 
 into the confirms of our weather trades.  Please let me hear from you.  You 
 can reach me via email, phone (713/853-5620) or fax (713/646-3490).

 Jay:  I am a lawyer with Enron.  I called for you on Friday, you're out, and 
 no one else could help.  I would like to speak with a Vitol lawyer about (1) 
 replacing our existing financial master with an ISDA (to accommodate a 
 broader range of products) and (2) specifically incorporating the relevant 
 ISDA definitions into the recent weather transaction confirmations even 
 though the master is an early master energy price swap agreement.  Please 
 call me at 713 853-5620 with the information so that we can move quickly.  
 Thank you for your help.  Sara
