 According to sources, funds are being told this morning that OPEC is likely 
 to cut production by 800,000 - 1 million b/d in Q1 2001, no later than the 
 end of February.  Most likely scenario as of now is that OPEC will hold an 
 extraordinary meeting in February to make the decision.  In the unlikely 
 event that prices continue to slide significantly, the decision might be 
 moved up to the January 17 meeting.
