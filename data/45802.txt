 Walter, to be able to get a quick turnaround on these counterparty setups, my 
 group needs the address and phone number to these counterparties....our 
 deadline is 10:00 am today, and with the minimal information on the 
 spreadsheet (just CP name) we will not be able to complete setup by deadline 
 and cause delays for the global contracts group.....
 
 Please provide the data above asap.....call if you have any 
 questions....thanks....

 Attached are new ClickPaper counterparty approvals for 10-13-00.  I tried to 
 get these out on Friday afternoon but Lotus Notes was down for everyone in 
 our group...
