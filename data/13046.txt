 I'm out the first week of January, but have nothing else scheduled.  I 
 reserve the right to reschedule anything at anytime if there is a commercial 
 need.

 Hello, everyone.  Please let me know which of these dates works best for 
 you.  It would be most helpful if you give me a range of available dates for 
 both preparation and the deposition itself.  That way, I can find overlapping 
 dates on which you all are available.  
 
 Thanks a lot.
 
 Michelle

 Michelle,
 
  Yesterday, counsel for Richard Clonch called, requesting January
 dates for the Enron depositions.  He provided me with the following dates
 possible dates; 1/3, 1/4, 1/5, 1/8, 1/9, 1/10, 1/11, 1/12, 1/22, 1/23, 1/24,
 1/25, 1/26.
 
  I told him that I would forward these dates to Enron.  I will send
 counsel for Richard Clonch availability dates for Enron Officials as soon as
 I hear from you.
 
  Thanks
