 You have received either a FedEx, UPS or other package in the mailroom on
 2/22/00.  They will delivered on the 11 o'clock run.  If they are either too
 large or too heavy to fit on the mail cart, or are non-priority,  they will be
 delivered prior to 4 PM.  Any questions please call 8505.
 
 Thanks
