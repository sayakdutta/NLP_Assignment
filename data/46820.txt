 If you were responding to this note earlier, Marilyn was asking if you wanted 
 to receive copies of all the documentation.  If so, please provide your 
 location.

 Hi Tana - 
 Cheryl Johnson has the document copies and will send you one. She is going to 
 start distributing copies as she updates the system instead of waiting for 
 the report sendout. If you want to be on the list, send her an email to be 
 added.  Marilyn
 
 
 
     
 I am being told that FirstEnergy Services Corp. is the successor by merger to 
 First Energy Trading Services Inc.  I do not have any documentation 
 reflecting this merger.  Do you?
