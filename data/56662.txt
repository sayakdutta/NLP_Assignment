 
 Ben,
 
 Let me review it one more time from this angle. If you don't hear from me by 
 Wednesday,
 it's OK to post it.

 Vince,
 
 Bijoya is currently working on the development of the website for the new 
 credit trading initiative, and we thought it would be a good idea to put my 
 recent technical article "Measuring Credit Risk" on it. Are you okay with 
 this release, or does it contain any proprietary information we should edit 
 out?
 
 Ben
