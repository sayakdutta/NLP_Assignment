 I enjoyed your presentation at the SIAM workshop last Friday. I have
 a much greater appreciation for the difficult problems you all solve.
 If at all possible, I would like to get a copy of your talk and
 any references to review papers in the general area of market modeling
 and potentially control. Have a great weekend.
 
 Best Regards,
 
 Dean Kassmann
