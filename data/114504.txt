 
 Broker is right - I've changed the deals to Allegheny Energy Supply Co.
 
 Thanks,

 We got a call from Allegheny Energy Electric Cooperative complaining that we 
 have sent confirmations for deals that they do not have.  Could you check on 
 these two deals.  The broker paper has these deals with Allegheny Energy 
 Supply Company.
