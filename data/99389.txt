 Attached is a copy of the Offer of Settlement that will be proposed by the
 Official Committee of Participant Creditors in the chapter 11 case for the
 California Power Exchange Corporation.
 
 As FERC's July 25 Order requires Judge Birchman to make recommendations
 regarding the amounts owed by each IOU to each Seller and to apply the
 methodologies required to make these determinations, the Offer of Settlemen=
 t
 will have to be presented to Judge Birchman as part of the ongoing
 proceedings, at the appropriate time.  In addition, the Offer of Settlement
 will be presented to the bankruptcy court in CalPX's  chapter 11 case at or
 about the same time it is presented to FERC.
 
 We are forwarding the attached copy of the Offer of Settlement to you with
 the understanding that it will not be distributed to any person or entity
 other than the attorneys listed above and the appropriate business contacts
 at their respective clients.  Our discussions regarding the Offer of
 Settlement will be much more effective if we can prevent the Offer from
 becoming generally available to the public, including to those who might
 oppose the Offer, before it is actually filed.
 
 Please review the attached copy of the Offer of Settlement and send me your
 comments and suggestions.  We would like to have your support for the Offer=
 .
 Perhaps it would be most efficient for Ron Carroll to schedule a conference
 call to discuss the Offer in more detail.  Please let me know.
