 
 Paul:
 
   With respect to Valentis:
 
  (a)  Does the MAC apply to both S&P and Moody's?  (not clear from worksheet)
  (b)  Are the financial covenants Events of Default or Termination Events?  
 (looks like these were Termination Events in AIG)
  (c)  Is this deal two-way margining?  You have set 0 Thresholds but 
 indicated Return/Delivery for both parties.  Our discussion of last week may 
 have changed (we discussed one-way margining for CP only).
 
 I'll have the same questions for CD Holdings.
