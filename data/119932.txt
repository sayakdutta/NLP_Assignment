 computer.  I downloaded some inofrmation on EOL regarding technical questions 
 which provides some of the requirements for EOL and sent them to him. Let me 
 know if there is anything else he needs to provide.  I have talked to Julia's 
 secretary and plane and hotel reservations have been reserved for Julie.
