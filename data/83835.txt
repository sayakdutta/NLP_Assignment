 NE-ISO is performing a very detailed gas study for the NE market (for 
 electric supply reliability purposes).  As a NEPOOL member, we will get a 
 copy of this study which will have great supply and demand information for 
 the NE market area.
 
 I will get you a copy when the study is completed.
