 
 I received a call back on the HPL on EOL subject from Ed and it appears that AEP intends to replicate what we have done on EOL via ICE.

 Fine with me.
  
     
 Brian,
 
 Tom and I have talked about what Enron would like to do to keep EOL going on HPL.  I do not know what AEP's plans are for trading on their system ICE.  Tom suggested I talk with Bill about the options, what do you think?  Is this OK with you?
