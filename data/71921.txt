 Kay:
 
 Ben and I are working on a deal that involves the monetization of a Cash Flow 
 Interest which ENA currently holds in Onondaga Cogeneration L.P. (an 80 MW 
 combined cycle plant in NY state)
 
 We would like to begin discussions next week with parties interested in 
 purchasing ENA's interest in OCLP.  Please prepare a form CA and forward to 
 Ben and I so that we may forward it to the interested counterparties.  We 
 also need one draft CA prepared for the following counterparty:
 
  Trust Company of the West
 
 Sheila has inititated the process of assigning the Cash Flow Interest from 
 ENA into an LLC.
 
 Call me if you wish to discuss.
 
 Fred
