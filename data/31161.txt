 This has been, and still is a serious problem.  There are some reports and

 Chris and Judy,
 Please pass on to any of your folks who need to know that we've completed
 the name change from Enron Cap & Trade to Enron North America.  Your new
 business party number is 7973.
 Let me know if any problems arise.  Thanks.   ii
