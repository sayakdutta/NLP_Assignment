 
 I forgot to mention something yesterday.  3 (g) states that within 10 days of 
 closing we will provide Coral with the documents on Exhibit T.  I personally 
 do not know if we have all the documents listed. We need to either verify 
 that we have these documents, or add some language about providing the ones 
 in our possession.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
