 
 we need to pass on penalties to counterparties who cut us on gas day of may 
 11.  many counterparties are swinging on eol deals, so  going foward we are 
 going to rank those counterparties to take the cuts.  as far as this deal 
 goes, the problems incurred were due to logistical issues.  we did rerank 
 wild goose for cycle 4, but pg&e did not allow for renoms on this cycle.

  I am passing on these penalties for non-performance Friday for the
 firm volumes that did not flow.  The firm sales amount of which you did not
 perform was  5000 mmbtu at $6.90.  Gas daily reported that the weekend
 traded as low as $3.70.  Therefore, we are assessing liquidated damages in
 the amount of US$16,000, the amount of which Lisa Feisst will invoice.  I
 would like to ensure that this problem does not happen again. Wildgoose is
 not the swing market, and all transactions completed on your screen are firm
 as are all transactions, unless otherwise specified, with Wildgoose and
 Alberta Energy Company.  We, at Alberta Energy Company consider this a
 serious matter, not the dollar figure associated but the implications in the
 California market place and are treating it as such.  Our companies have had
 a longstanding relationship and we would like rectify this problem so we can
 regain trading together in the future.  A letter outlining the above will be
 sent to yourself  and John Lavorado for your records.
 
  Thanks
