 Kimberly, I was laid off on Monday and have not had my latest expense report electronically deposited into the credit union.  I was assured by management that I would be paid.  The amount is 642.10.  I would think that this is the least enron could do for me since I have only worked for EES for 2 months.  
  
 Please ensure that my funds are deposited as soon as possible due to my current financial crisis.
  
 Thank You,
