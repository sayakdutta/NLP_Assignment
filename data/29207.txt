 Attached please find 2 draft letter to send to acquiring shippers with copies 
 to releaseing shippers.
 
 Letter A is to go to those shippers that have not paid the November 
 invoices.  Pursuant to the tariff, Northern can give notice to terminate the 
 service agreement.  At such point, the service agreement reverts back to the 
 releasing shipper.The letter includes a notice that we consider the agreement 
 extended to 2003 per the rate case even without their execution.
 
 Letter B is to go to those acquiring shippers that paid the November 
 invoices.  For those service agreement with an original expiration date of 
 10/31/99, the payment constitutes acknowledgement that the agreement 
 continues to 2002 pursuant to the administrative amendment that extended the 
 agreement pursuant to the rollover provisions.  The letter includes a notice 
 that we consider the agreement extended to 2003 per the rate case even 
 without their execution.
 
 Do we want to add to both letters that if the amendment is not executed, 
 Northern will consider the releases temporary and the entitlement will revert 
 back to the releasing shipper by x date?  or do we want to just wait until 
 11/1/02 and see what happens.  (the revert back maybe should be in a separate 
 letter to the Releasing Shipper otherwise the acquiring shipper will just do 
 nothing and we'll be fighting with the releasing shipper anyway.  I'm 
 rambling but hopefully you get the jist. 
 
 Please let me have your comments ASAP because I don't know when 30 days from 
 the invoice runs out.  Considering they have ten days to pay and we know they 
 haven;t paid, we for sure only have 20 days.  Thanks, Dari
