 
 I do recall the conversations you and I had (actually a series of pages, I 
 believe), so I'll check with Rebecca and see if she still has those signature 
 pages.

 Kay-are you certain that Enron didn't sign it, because I recall that it was
 signed (and the conversations we had about getting it signed)

 Marissa,
 
 I suppose that's because ENA didn't sign it, as I didn't notice it (opps).
 It will probably be tomorrow since Ben will need to initial, as well as me.
 Can you email me the sig page?
 
 Thanks,
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
   
  
 Kay:
 
 This past Friday, I received six original signature pages to the Letter
 Agreement, but did not receive original signature pages to the Guaranty.
 Could you forward the signature pages to the Guaranty at your earliest
 convenience?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Marisa
 
 
     
 
 Hi there,
 
 I believe Chris should be back today, so I wanted to follow up on this.
 
 I don't have any recollection of where we left the escrow agreement with
 NW.  Please get with MKahn or Jerry DeBerry to see if we can get consensus
 on the current form of escrow agreement.  Once we have that, Enron (Chris)
 will make contact with Citibank.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
