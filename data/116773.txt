 
 Just for everyone's information - I've entered two buys from Seattle City 
 Light to negate an earlier sale of power to the company (Deal 317868). The 
 deals are as follows:
 
 515404
 STCA buys SCL
 2/8/01-2/28/01
 SP-15
 Off Peak
 $115.00
 
 515420
 LTCA buys SCL
 3/1/01-3/31/01
 SP-15
 Off Peak
 $115.00
 
 I'm giving you this disclaimer either because you asked me to enter the deal, 
 the deal is in your book, or the deal will affect your calc. The volume is 
 shaped between 1 and 2 MW. Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate
