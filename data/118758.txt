 I am putting together the request for assistance from local counsel in Japan 
 in preparation for opening up EnronOnline to Japanese counterparties.  If you 
 have a copy of the request you sent to MSJ when you started working on this 
 for Australia it would be very helpful to me.  I have what we've used in 
 Europe but would be grateful for your thoughts as well.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Mark
