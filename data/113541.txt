 I have a document by someone named Marty Howard, who I believe may be
 associated with Portland General. The document was sent to me by Richard
 Tabors. According to the email Howard used to work for McCullough.
 
 After a very brief read through, I think it tries to show that the
 statistical link between prices in CA and the PNW was WEAK in peak hours. I
 suppose they are trying to show that the "contagion" effect from California
 show not be an issue? I have some problems from an initial read with the
 econometric analysis, but I have not yet reviewed it fully.
 
 However, it also leaves open the very possibility that was discussed earlier
 on the call. If there is a refund, and it is based on some notion of "PNW
 prices", it could be a very large one. I think we need to consider this
 issue quite carefully.
