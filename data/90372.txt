 Please note that this is a NERC OC ballot. As your rep to the NERC OC, I
 will cast one ballot for SERC RRC. My current intent is to vote in favor of
 both these items. If you have additional input that should be considered,
 please send your comments and suggestions for voting to me.
 THANKS, John

 =09Dear Operating Committee:
 
 =09To date, we have received no comments on either the Control Area
 =09Criteria or Policy 3.  I need your ballot on these two documents by
 the
 =09end of the day on May 4.  If they pass by 2/3 affirmative vote, then
 =09I'll send on to the Board for approval in June.
 
 =09Both docs are attached.
 
 =09I've also attached a spiffy little ballot for you to use.  Just
 enter
 =09your name and click on the Yes or No boxes, and then send it to me
 as an
 =09e-mail attachment.  Remember to press your mouse button hard -- I
 don't
 =09what to have to deal with hanging chads.  The ballot is "dumb" and
 you
 =09can press both yes and no for the same item, so just don't do that
 or
 =09I'll have to call you.
 
 =09If you don't want to mess with this form, just drop me an e-mail.
 
 =09thanks,
 
 =09don.
