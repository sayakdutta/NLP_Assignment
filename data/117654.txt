 Nony,
 
 I believe that Marcus von Bock in the Legal Dept is working on this and the 
 huge project concerning the legal  issues surrounding the internet around the 
 globe  (I  did the first Xtranet site for Switzerland towards the end of last 
 year).
 
 I have copied this message to Marcus.
 
 Kind regards
 
 Mark

 Mark:
 
  Mark Taylor would like to have an update from someone in the London group 
 regarding the internet trading plans in Europe.  In particular, he is 
 wondering if there are enforceability/statute of frauds type issues in Europe 
 like we might face here and what research has been done to date in that 
 area.  I remember that during our January meeting you briefly discussed 
 websites for Germany and Switzerland for power trading as well as procedures 
 for contracting electronically, etc.  Would you be able to address Mark 
 Taylor's questions in our upcoming meeting on Tuesday?  If not, could you 
 help me identify someone else in the group that can address this issue?
 
 Many thanks.
 Nony Flores
