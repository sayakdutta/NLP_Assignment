 Attached are my final comments.  They deal more with the proposal to curtail exports (including muni).  I don't really care if we file this with the material we have already put together, or do something with it separately.  With respect to the ATC and TTC questions we were addressing earlier, I haven't added anything to what Steve put together.  The CAISO's argument about restricting ATC because of Path 15 congestion, because, as Steve points out, any technical problems would affect both TTC AND ATC.  If anyone has any questions, let me know
