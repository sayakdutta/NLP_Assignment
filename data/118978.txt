 I have a commodity futures account in which I only trade cattle and grain
 futures, no energy.

 We  are  in  the  process  of  preparing  applications  for  position limit
 exemptions  for  ENA's  NYMEX  energy  commodities  futures trading.  These
 applications  require  that  ENA represent whether its officers, employees,
 owners,  or  agents  have  a power of attorney, control or have a financial
 interest  in any related commodity future(s) account either individually or
 acting with another person pursuant to express or implied agreement.
 
 Please  direct  any responses to my paralegal, Tana Jones, via intercompany
 email or call her at (713) 853-3399 by the end of business on June 15, 2001
 if  you have any power of attorney, control or have a financial interest in
 any commodity futures account (other than an ENA or other trading affiliate
 account).
 
 IF  YOU DO NOT HAVE A COMMODITY FUTURES ACCOUNT, YOU DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND
 TO THIS REQUEST.
