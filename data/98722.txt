 Richard,
 
 Below is the resume of a friend of George Hope, a member of the Online Team.  
 As head of legal recruiting, if it meets the needs of any particular group, 
 please pass it on.

 Shari,
  I hope that you had a good holiday. This resume is a very good friend of 
 mine who wants to get on here at Enron and I wanted
 to forward her resume on to you. I was hoping you could take a look and let 
 me know if you have any needs in your group or if you could
 recommend that I send it to any other groups. I have spoken to Tana Jones who 
 said that she has no needs at this time, thank you for your
 time.
  George Hope
