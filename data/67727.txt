 
 Please replace your physical tabs in your P&L to the file format attached=
 =20
 below.  This should eliminate interdesk variances.  You will need to add th=
 e=20
 MTM information and any transport/flash to actual items that you currently=
 =20
 may have on your physical tab.  I would suggest doing this tomorrow morning=
 =20
 when you roll your P&L.  Shout with any questions.  Thanks.

 Attached is a revision of the current =01+Physical=01, tab found in each de=
 sk=01,s=20
 Regions/Last Day files.  In an effort to standardize and more efficiently=
 =20
 identify and eliminate Interdesk/Intercompany variances we propose that you=
 =20
 replace your existing physical tab with the attached template by Thursday,=
 =20
 February 22.
 
 Please re-link those cells pulling information from other sheets within you=
 r=20
 file (i.e. Third Party Sales, Third Party Purchases, CPR Fuels, CPR=20
 Imbalance, CPR Cash Out, CPR Pipeline Exchange, and CPR Storage).
 
 Follow these steps when entering data:
 
 1. Select your desk=01,s name in the drop down box.  The desk name appears=
 =20
 exactly as it does on your desk level summary report from CPR. =20
 2. Select the "counterparty name" involved in the transaction.  It also=20
 should appear exactly as it does on your desk level summary report.=20
 3. Enter the Volume and Dollars.  No need to summarize the numbers under on=
 e=20
 general name.
 
 The template automatically assigns the correct =01+OA Code=01,, which is dr=
 iven by=20
 the company numbers.=20
 
 Please provide me with any feedback by Thursday, February 22 if the templat=
 e=20
 creates issues for your desk.
