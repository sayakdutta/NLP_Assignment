 Thanks. Enjoy your trip.
 I hope you come back in one piece.

 Vince,
  
 I learned late last week that if this deal goes through, I will be joining NETCO.  Unfortunately, my responsibilities, as you can imagine, are going to change, and I will no longer be supporting your group. Kymberly Booth will be your new HR representative, and will be setting up a meeting with you shortly.  I would have liked to have been able to take the time to introduce you to Kym, but with my ski trip, I don't think that is going to be able to happen.
  
 Please know though that I will always be of service to you and your great team, and if there is anything that I can ever do for you, do not hesitate to let me know.
  
 Outstanding Issue:
     Rakesh:  I am going to try and get in touch with Robert Jones today so that we can get this wrapped up.
  
 Thanks again for all of your kindness and support,
 Anne
