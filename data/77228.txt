 be a private party as SeaWorld, which could be fun. They usually do 
 everything first class all the way, since it is the officers shindig.  I get 
 to see some nice people I only see once a year.  Everyone parties hard, too.
 
 Diet time!  I've done ok so far, considering the travel.  This means I've 
 lost the weight I gained when I was on the road every week.

 I will put this on our calendars.  Too bad you won't make the Compaq thing, 
 but maybe next year.  San Antonio, wow what a let down from the other 
 cities.  That will be a nice time of year though.  I can recommend some good 
 restaurants since I took Ric there last year for his birthday.  We stayed at 
 the Menger and had a great time.

 This Friday - Michael goes for a visit at  St. Francis, which may be his new 
 school (so far, so good).  I'll be in around1000
 
 Most Fridays I'm going to TRY to pick Michael up since I'm away so much, 
 which means leaving by 445 or so.
 
 October 4, ENA orientation in the am.
 
 October 19/20, Neil is out of town, so I have to pick Michael up from school 
 (leave at 430)
 
 October 26/27, hope to be vacation time.  Neil has a meeting in San Antonio 
 (usually it is in Miami, San Francisco, Phoenix - not so great this year).  
 It is the officer's meeting for Enterprise, and spouses are invited.  This 
 means we won't be in town for the Compaq thing. Figures, of course.  Thanks 
 for asking.
 
 I'm watching for some good vacation days, also...
