 I would emphasize that they have had more than enough time for a response and 
 while we would like to think they are cooperating, the lack of response 
 little reason to believe otherwise.  Suggest that any further delay would 
 require us to explore all our options for access into CMS.
 
 At this point I would feel more comfortable with suggesting we would need to 
 go to FERC via a phone conversation with CMS.   Let me know if you want to 
 discuss this further.
