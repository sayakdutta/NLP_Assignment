 Looks okay.  No chance of going $.01 wider on non-tailgate?  Also, I don't think we'll be able to take Clear Lake gas until Phase I is completed (sometime around 5/7 I'm hearing).
 
 
     
 Lauri,
 
 Here are the rates for May.  Again the A/D long haul rates are irrelevant for most of the month.  Call me if you have any questions.
 
 
 Thanks,
 
 Tom
