  including Beth Apollo on invites to participate in recruiting.  I think th=
 at I mentioned her to you.  She is a VP who joined my team in January after=
  spending four years in Enron's London office.  She graduated from Trinity =
 and worked in public accounting before coming to Enron.  She would be great=
  to have on a team.  I would love for her to join us at UT, but if she has =
 another preference that is great, too.  If she is not on your list yet, why=
  don't you call her for an introduction and give her the rundown on the sch=
 ools that you are responsible for so that she can make a choice.  Thanks.  =
