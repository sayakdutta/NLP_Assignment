 
 I am forwarding a copy of Leslie's email, as a sample for you.  I input 
 Leslie's responses in my EOL Legal Database, so I can keep track, product by 
 product, of what we said for a counterparty, and then our rationale behind 
 it, in case we need to reconstruct why we said "no trading" at a later date.  
 If it's an "amended" counterparty, she will tell be whether or not she is 
 changing an earlier approval.  Further, I put Leslie's notes about any 
 particular contract issue in the database, like "override letter", "online 
 GTC", or whatever.  Again, it's our memory of what we approval, and I hope 
 with thousands of approvals out there, I know I can't remember everthing.
