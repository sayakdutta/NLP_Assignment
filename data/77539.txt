 I left you a voice mail, but being an email addict I thought I would send you 
 a note as well.  
 
 Our son, Michael is in a Montessori kindergarten, which we have decided may 
 not be most suitable for him.  We discussed it with Vivian Shudde, and she 
 suggested that I give you a call about the Grace School.  
 
 My husband and I would like to visit Grace.  We are wondering if it might be 
 possible to visit tomorrow.  Please let me know what you think.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay Mann
