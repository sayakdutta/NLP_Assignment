 Gina, 
 
 I was thinking about calling you and suggesting an "Italian only" 
 lunch. I can also introduce you to my associate, Rakesh Bharati, 
 who studies Italian on his own. 
 
 What about Tuesday next week?

 Mr. Kaminski; 
 
 It was a delight talking with you the other day, and I was especially happy to have such a pleasant conversation in Italian.  
 
 I hope that we can get together again sometime to for a chat, and maybe a lunch.  I look forward to meeting you again.  
 
   
 All the best 
 
 Gina Corteselli
