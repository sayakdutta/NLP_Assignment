 I have scheduled a conference call for tomorrow (Wed.) at 2pm to follow-up
 on the draft amendments to AB 60x and Calpine's meeting in the Speaker's
 office.  In summary, Calpine was not able to convince Rick Simpson to drop
 the bill, nor was he interested in moving it in another direction on the
 Assembly side.  On tomorrow's call we will be discussing what steps IEP and
 member companies should take as this bill moves forward.
