 
 Hi Helyette,
 
 Congratulations on your papers.
 
 The purchase contract is in the last stage of approvals
 (it's circulating through different parts of the company
 where it has to be signed). I think we should be able to execute
 the contract  in the first few days of December.
 
 I shall let you know as soon as our internal process is completed.

 Dear Vince,
 I guess time has been flying for you by since our brilliant show
 in Paris.In my case,it is the same:I got 3 papers accepted in THE
 3 major Journals in Finance(Journal of Business,Journal of Finance
 and Journal of Financial Economics).We should write a piece!
 Our software seems to be quite satisfactory for the oil people.My
 lawyer had added a paragraph to Karla's document:since she had
 mentioned the right for Enron to check at any time the code source
 etc,he wanted to request Enron to pay his fees in the case D-G
 disappeared.In any case,if you are still interested,we are ready to
 use your escrow account to make things simpler.Moreover,I am
 striking an agreement with a software company ,13years with
 people from Polytechnique+finance,to be our hot line(with us paying
 royalties,of course).This would complement my 2 associates.
 Looking forward to hearing from you
 Helyette
