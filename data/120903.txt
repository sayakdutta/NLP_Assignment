 
 Thanks so much for sending the CDs.  I really didn't think I would ever see them again!  I take it that you are still considering coming back to windjammer.  I guess it will depend on what happens when you get home.  Kim 1, Stacy, Susie and I are considering the Poly trip in January.  I haven't been to those islands (St. Martin, St. Barts, etc.) yet so I might have to go.
 
 I can't imagine a place better than the caribbean - I would love to see it!  So if you're not serious - don't tease me!
 
 Take care and thanks again for the CDs -
 Love,
 K2
 
  
     
 Glad you had a good time, hopefully we can catch up
 again at some time in the near future. If I dont come
 back to windjammer and stay at home you are most
 welcome to come visit.
 Were I live is even better than the Caribbean.
 
 PS> Your CDs are on there way to Miami, I sent them
 to the office today with the other mail, so they
 should have them soon this week.
 
 Take Care
 Love Lyndon
