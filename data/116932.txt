 
 Who's ready to rhumba? Crystal Ballroom holds salsa classes on the first 
 Tuesday of every month. The hour-long class begins at 7p.m., with live music 
 and dancing afterward. Cost is $8 for the whole evening. The other Tuesdays 
 of the month have live music and dancing, and sometimes classes too. Anyway, 
 I'm sure it won't take us more than an hour to become master Latin dancers on 
 par with Ricky Martin and Christina Aguilera.
 
 Do you want to try it out? Next class is Jan. 23. And there is actually a 
 salsa event going on at the Crystal this Friday night with bands and dancing 
 and all kinds of mayhem - it's $12 and doors open at 7 p.m. Mark your 
 calendars and tell all your coordinated (and/or good-looking) friends to come 
 along.

 *Does this mean "live dance" or "dance lives" or "my friend Viva likes the 
 way you dance" or none of the above?
