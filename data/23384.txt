 Dear Sir:
 
 My understanding is that Mr. Rick Bergsieker and you are the only directors
 of Enron Middle East, Ltd., and that Mr. Darrin Donegan is the current local
 manager of this company.  I also understand that Mr. Bergsieker is not with
 Enron any more, Enron Middle East is still solvent, and it has very limited
 indebtedness, other than my outstanding expense claims.
 
 PLEASE READ ON.
 
 I was an employee of Enron from 9 September 1999 to 5 December 2001 and from
 1 February 2001 to the end, my Enron employer was Enron Middle East.  During
 this time, I incurred business related expenses with the prior knowledge and
 approval of my supervisors totaling US$90,000.  I have duly filed and had
 approved these expense claims, but unfortunately have not received the
 reimbursement yet.  Mr. Clay Harris was my last boss and he is still with


 documentation relating to the claim.
 
 PLEASE READ ON.
 
 Albeit very limited, Enron Middle East does have some assets.  I plead with
 you to instruct Mr. Donegan to sell Enron Middle East's assets reimburse my
 pre-agreed, appropriately lodged, and duly approved expense claims, whose
 non-payment has been ruinous for my family.
 
 I thank you for your help at these difficult times.
