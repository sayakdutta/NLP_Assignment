 I assume that this is being done to meet the needs of Richard Sanders' legal

 I have attached a revised version to the complaint that I sent out last 
 night, along with a redlined version.  In addition to some wordsmithing and 
 the like, please note footnote 1, which is new.  We are still researching for 
 California cases that support the FERC cases we have cited (for proposition 
 that economic hardship does not constitute force majuere).
 
 This needs to be filed today, so please give me your comments quickly.  
 Thanks.  Ron
