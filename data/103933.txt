 willing, we'd love your participation in the credit/legal meeting.  SS

 Sara:
 Great news!  I will give her a call on Monday!  Hope all is going well.  
 Again, I'm happy to participate in the legal/credit meeting on Tuesday by 
 phone.  Alos, do we need to go through my memo?  Just call or e-mail me.
