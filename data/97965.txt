 Mike Diamond (for PaineWeber) has negotiated an agreement with Mike Swartz
 that none of the defendants need respond to the pending discovery at this
 time.  We will be having further discussions.  I think some of the
 defendants "demurred" today rather than answering.  A demurrer is roughly
 the state-court equivalent of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion.
 
 I will keep you advised.
