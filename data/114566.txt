 
 I'm not sure why you're seeing a price of $65.70 come through on this deal, 
 but I'm looking at the deal in EnPower right now and I see a price of $65. If 
 you could let me know what report is showing the incorrect price, I might be 
 able to figure out why.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate

 Your deal # 581358.1 is showing a price of 65.70 but on the Real Time 
 spreadsheet, I see 65.00.  Which is correct?
 
 Thanks for you help
