 
 I've been working with Laura Wente to locate these documents for a couple 
 days, and I think I've found what you need. If you could call or e-mail with 
 your fax number, I'll send what I have over to you and expedite the process. 
 If you'd like to peruse the EIS documents online, go to 
 www.tis.eh.doe.gov/nepa/ and click the heading DOE NEPA Analyses.
 
 Please let me know if I can be of further assistance. My phone number is 
 503.464.3748.
