 
 Attached is the URL to get to what should be a real audio broadcast of 
 tomorrow's PUC business meeting.  The meeting starts at 10 AM PST.  Many who 
 have tried to use the link in the past have been unable to connect, but the 
 PUC may have since worked the kinks out.  I will be at the meeting and will 
 report back via email.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
