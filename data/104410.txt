 Folks,
 
 National Bank of Canada has forwarded the attached draft documents for our 
 review.  I asked if they had electronic versions of the ENA - NBC  documents 
 and they have apparently gone a step further and actually generated the draft 
 Garden State - NBC documentation without the confirms.  Finley will continue 
 to drive forward on the confirms.  I would appreciate any comments on the 
 attached documents by mid-day tomorrow so that we can possibly get this in 
 place.
 
 Thanks,
 Rodney
