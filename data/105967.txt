 I don't know anything about this swap and Mary is on vacation.  Would you 
 please provide me with more information about the swap, deadlines, etc.?  
 Thanks.

 the latest is that they are going to put equity and warrants into raptor and 
 not the debt.
 deb, did mary leave you the questionnaire of jim's re this asset?
 that needs to go to mary/sara to do the swap (i can't remember mary's 
 vacation schedule, but sara i think she is gone now??)
