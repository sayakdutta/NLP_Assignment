 	Can the two of you coordinate a revenue model for Sun Devil that incorporates a Straight - Fixed Variable rate design along the following parameters using 15, 20 and 25 year terms:
 
 San Juan utilization: 85% of 780,000/MMBtu/d
 Mainline: 85% utilization of 810,000/MMBtu/d
 Phoenix lateral: 75% utilization of 500,000 MMBtu/d
 
 Also, prepare some ROE sensitivities if the above utilization falls by 10% and rises by 10%. 
 
 I will be out of town till Tues 11/13.  Can we get together that morning and review your analyses?
 
 page me if you have questions at 888-582-7421
 
 thanks
