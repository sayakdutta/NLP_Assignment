 I am glad that I was able to add a little more happiness to her life.  Tell 
 Aunt Twila and Uncle Gene hi for me and have a good time this weekend.
 
 Love, Eric
 
 
 
 

    
 
 
 Hi Guy. Do hope you have a great trip to Vegas. It  should be fun. Do not let 

 tables the greater the odds are that the house will take  your money. I talk 
 from experience. Nice touch on the flowers to your Mom. She  really is 
 enjoying them. It made her feel good that you remembered her on  Valentine's 
 Day. Call us when you get home. Love-Dad
