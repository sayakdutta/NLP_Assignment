 that Hancock funds would not be able to be scheduled for release for 
 Wednesday AM due to Enron's inability to deliver Escrow agreemens and Turbine 
 Contracts, consents, etc.  in a timely manner.
 
  This deal has been sitting out their to long and there is a concern that 
 Delta is buying time in order to survey the power markets in California.  
 Delta issued an RFP earlier in the week for power sales from their Pegasus 
 project and asking for responses by Thursday 4/26.
 
  Immediate closure is critical.  Please provide me with the complete list of 
 Enron Deliverables that are outstanding and standing between Enron, Delta, 
 Hancock and Funding.
