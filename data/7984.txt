 
 Gwynn,
 
 Sally wasn't quite sure what you wanted.  She put together a little something 
 - if you can use it fine, if not, that's fine too.
 
 Opportunities for accounting professionals in traditional and in 
 non-traditional roles, such as transaction structuring, risk analysis and 
 commodity operations.

 Laura Schwartz and I are working on pulling together the article that goes 
 with the photo taken last week for the NABA national newsletter.  We get 
 approximately 550 words to tell the Enron story in anticipation of our 
 recruiting presence at the NABA national conference in July.  Are there any 
 particular messages you would like us to get out there with regard to 
 opportunities in EWS and EES for accountants?  Please let me know your 
 thoughts before the end of next week (the sooner the better - the final due 
 date for photo and story is April 13).
 
 Many thanks
