 Please forward this to the appropriate person in your group.
 
 I need someone to look into deal Sitara #833675, referenced below.  Why were these deals actualized to zero?

 To recap what we talked about this morning.  The following deals were done for June.  ENA is not showing these deals in you system so therefore they won't pay.  
 





 
 Thank you, in advance, for your help with this.
