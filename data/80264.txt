 Mr. McConnell,
 
 This is Jason Stirman, Don Stirman's son.  I e-mailed you my resume a few
 weeks ago, and you sent it to a couple people from Enron.  I haven't heard
 back from anyone yet, so I was wondering if you knew of someone I could
 contact to follow up?  Thanks again for your help.
 
 Sincerely,
 Jason Stirman
