 Steven,
 
 I understand you indicated to Louise Kitchen the other day that you may wish 
 to provide a list of contacts to receive brochures about EnronOnline.
 
 Could you please confirm if you wish to do this, and if so, send me the list 
 so I can ensure that it is included in the mailing?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Dave
