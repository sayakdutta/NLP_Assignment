 
 Molly,
 
 It  seems that we got only Bill Bradford so far.
 
 Given that almost everybody will be out that week,
 we probably should move the interview to the
 beginning of January, even if it means higher
 costs.

 Bill Bradford has returned our call, and is scheduled to see Iris at 11:30 am 
 on 12/28.  More info as it becomes available.
