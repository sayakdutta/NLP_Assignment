 Interesting info for those of you who follow or have an interest in this type 
 of data regarding succes of market liberalisation.  Further interesting to 
 note that household prices fell in Sweden and Finland, markets that already 
 had liberalised wholesale markets, after furhter market opening to 
 residential secotr.  Note fall in German prices, which, despite bad access 
 regime, ended up with a suicidal competition in the wholesale market by 
 incumbents.  Let me know if you need more/have any questions.   mcs
