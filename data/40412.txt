 outside counsel on it.  I don't know who legal typically uses although I'm 
 pretty sure Dale used Dan Watkiss of  Bracewell and Patterson for one 
 project.  Power marketers proposals are tariff filings for market-based rates 
 under Section 205 of the Federal Power Act.  The Commission has 60 days to 
 accept them from the date FERC notices the filing in the Federal Register or 
 the filing is deemed accepted.  EWG applications are made under Section 32 of 
 the Public Utiluty Holding Company Act.  Thereunder, the Commission must make 
 an EWG determination within 60 days of its receipt of an EWG application.

 Mary-- I have several "new guy" questions for you.  How do we prefer to take 
 care of the required FERC filings for Market Based Rate Authorization and for 
 EWG status in connection with power plant developments?  I ask this in the 
 context of the PSCo project, where we have a project LLC as the development 
 vehicle, and we anticipate selling the LLC before commercial operation.  
 Specifically, do we do this in-house with govt. affairs people, through Enron 
 DC office people, through outsside counsel for the project, through outside 
 counsel not otherwise affiliated with the project, or otherwise? And, when do 
 we  usually do the filings? Thanks.
