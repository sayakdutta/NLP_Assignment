 
 Lori - here is the initial "wish list" from the credit derivatives people.  
 If you can focus on these first and let me know about them I'd appreciate it.

 Bryan,
 
 I believe Mark Taylor is out of the office until Wednesday.
 
 At this point, I believe there are 6 approved Reference Entities for 
 EnronOnline.
 
 We will add more up to the previously discussed 20 as approvals are received.

 After reviewing all of the lists, attached is the list of reference credits 
 that I forwarded to Mark to load on Enorn Online.
 
 
 
 Call me if you have any concerns.
