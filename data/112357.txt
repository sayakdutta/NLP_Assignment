 Contract Details
 For info. on the parties, contracts, etc. see:  http://www.sco.ca.gov/power_page/whatare/longterm.htm.  Note, I have the complete set of all the contracts with me, but the Controller's site has copies of the pages of the contracts with all the important details, which is all you probably need.
