 
 Laura,
 
 Here is a draft transfer price agreement:
 
 
 
 I'm sure we may want to add some details, etc, but at least this gives us a 
 beginning point.
 
 I'm hoping that you received the revised draft of the Manlove LOI on 
 September 8 which incorporated your initial comments to the first draft. We 
 can discuss what you see as the most efficient path forward, and any 
 additions, etc, you think are necessary.
 
 I look forward to seeing you on Thursday, and breathing some cooler air for a 
 change.
 
 My cell phone is 713 304 8716, should you need to reach me in the meanwhile. 
 I will also be checking my voicemail, but will not be picking up email.
 
 Kay
