 Okay!  I have to be the bad guy and say I can't meet Monday.  I have a meeting with Kevin Hyatt from 9 - 10 am.  Can't skip that one.  Mansoor agreed we can meet on Tuesday at the same time in his office.  Is this still okay with you Michelle?

 Is Monday Mar-4, 9-10 am or Tuesday-Mar-4, 9-10 am ( my office) good for you to discuss the Baker Field project?
 Please let me know. 
 
 Thanks, Mansoor
