 As we discussed on our public affairs committee conference call earlier this 

 Regency, Sacramento. 
 
 The objectives of the meeting are to:
    Establish a strategy for upcoming Senate Investigation 
    Develop key messages and list of collateral materials needed for summer 
 2001 
    Discuss strategy for potential ballot initiative campaign
 
 If you have not already done so, please forward your outage standard report 
 to Katie or me ASAP so that we can incorporate it into the collateral 
 materials we are developing in regards to ongoing price gouging and 
 withholding allegations.  We would like to represent each IEP member in our 
 materials. 
 
 An agenda and specific location will follow prior to the meeting.  Please 
 RSVP to Katie or Carol if you will be able to attend.  Hope to see you 
 there!  Have a great weekend.
 
 Thanks,
 Jean
