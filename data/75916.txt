 Attached are the execution copies of the Turbo Park documents that are 
 relevant to power plant equipment procurement and development.   I have asked 
 Finance to provide us with summaries of the relevant provisions since the 
 120+ page Participation Agreement, which is largely a loan agreement, is very 
 complex.  I will nevertheless attempt to summarize the "process" of getting 
 into and out of TurboPark.  In the meantime, please familiarize yourselves 
 with the documents.
