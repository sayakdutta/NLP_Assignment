 
 Karen,
 
 Both Lisa Bills and Rose Engeldorf are out of town this week, which means we 
 don't have all the players from Global Finance available.  Humberto (can't 
 remember how to spell his last name) from Global Finance/ENA may be 
 available, and he has participated in similar discussions on two other 
 projects.  At some point he will need to be involved.  
 
 The time is fine with me.
 
 Kay

 Is everyone available at 2:00 Pacific time on Monday for a call to discuss 
 the GE turbine contract assignment issues in the Pastoria EPC contract?  
 Please confirm with Jan (503/464-8814) and we'll set up a call-in number.  
 Thanks.
