 
 As an FYI, from time to time I will be preparing NDAs for the Networks team 
 headed by Mark S. Palmer working with Travis on "Project Offline".  Project 
 Offline has evolved a form of NDA and added a non-solicitation clause and a 
 residuals clause.  I wanted you to be familiar with the form in case Travis 
 is not here, you,as are my backup lawyer for the Networks team.  The form, 
 like all my Networks forms is kept in my "Confidentiality Agreements" 
 subdirectory under "Forms" (in case you ever need it and I'm not around).

 The nonsolicitation clause is one way (rest is bilateral)  so if it is 
 included you have to remember to fill in its blanks.  (You probably would 
 remember this anyway!)
