 	Kim--
 
 	I think we finished all the letters.  It was fun helping you guys out!
 
 	By the way, do you have any books in your dept. for ordering supplies with logos/names etc. on them?  I was trying to 
 	find a place from which I could order some napkins, plastic glasses, etc. with a name on it, as a B-day gift for someone.
