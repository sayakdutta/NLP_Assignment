 
 Rae, 
 
 I am not sure if Jeff Hodge has already volunteered me.  If he has not, I 
 would like to volunteer to be on the drafting committee.  I am not available 
 May 29th through June 1st.  Otherwise, I can make myself available whenever 
 the drafting committee meets.
 
 Thank you, 
 
 Stacy Dickson
