 
 I sent an electronic copy to John Baker.  Maureen could you send one directly 
 to Jason and schedule lunch? thanks

 Steve,
 
 Thanks a lot for coming to class and talking to us on Tuesday.  
 I think your presentation had a strong impact on Rice students, and many of 
 them, including me, got a much better idea of Enron and its businesses.
 
 I am not sure if you were going to distribute the copy of your presentation 
 to us, but I certainly would consider it useful for my self-education about 
 the company.
 Let me know if I could possibly get a copy from you.
 
 As I mentioned to you on Tuesday, I am starting full-time at Enron on the 
 15th of January as a manager in Research Group, under Vince Kaminski.
 I would like for us to go out for lunch sometime in January, if this is OK 
 with you.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Jason Sokolov
