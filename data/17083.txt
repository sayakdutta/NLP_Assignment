 John Neslage is trying to pull together exactly what you're requesting.  
 He'll get it to you as soon as we've got it pulled together.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Jeff--can you send me asap  a real quick message listing all of the current 
 "X" legislation that is out there that we are following, along with a brief 
 description of what each bill is about and whether we support or oppose.  
 That will help me keep track of the alphabet soup.  Thanks.  MDS
