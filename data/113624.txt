 We had a short conference call on Friday to discuss next steps with respect to the FERC's NOPR on affiliate standards.  We will be having another call on Friday to identify the issues which Enron should address in its comments (Geriann will be arranging for the call).   Please be prepared to offer your assessment of which issues require our attention.   Leslie and Tom will be drafting the comments, with Leslie focusing on gas issues and Tom on electric.  
 
 The Notice was published in the Federal Register on September 27th.   Our comments are due on November 19th. 
 
 If you're unable to make the call, please forward an email with your list of issues.  I look forward to talking to you on Friday.
