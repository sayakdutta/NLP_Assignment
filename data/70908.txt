 
 Hi Dave,
 
 I received a signed change order from Randy Milcer (not sure about that) 
 yesterday.  The form he signed indicates that ABB will be paying Enron, and 
 has one small mistake in the amount of payments made on the cancelled 
 transformers ($400 off).  With your permission I will substitute the correct 
 version so ABB gets the money.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
