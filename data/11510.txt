 
 We have submitted your request for $30 million of UK Power VAR to the Board for approval. I thought about this issue a lot before doing so because I don't feel we are fully in control of the infrastructure there and a large limit can add to the danger. My understanding is that there is an IT and backoffice effort underway to improve this situation and it needs to have focus to complete. Please keep the pressure on over there to get the infrastructure where it needs to be. Thanks, Rick
