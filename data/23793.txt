 
 Paul, 
 
 Attached is the most recent versions of the above-referenced agreements which 
 incorporates the changes you negotiated with our Credit Department.  There 
 was one additional change to the Master Agreement to Section 4.2(ix).  I have 
 also attached the letter agreement which cancels the physical gas deals for 
 April.  Please review and give me your comments.
