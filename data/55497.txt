 
 Dale,
 
 Sorry for a delay in responding to your message.
 I shall talk to the head of our B2B unit on Friday this week and
 shall remind him about your visit.
 
 I hope he can make a decision at this time whether he is interested
 in pursuing this opportunity

 Vince:
 
 I sent you an email a couple of days ago to inquire if we might get together
 at your offices on July 5 or July 7 in Houston to follow up our earlier
 discussions.  I notice I have two email addresses for you, so I am sending
 this to both.  I am not sure the earlier transmission got to you.
 
 Would you be available the afternoon of the 5th or the morning of the 7th to
 continue our earlier discussions?  Give me an email or phone shout at
 650.218.3069.
 
 Thanks
 
 Dale Nesbitt
