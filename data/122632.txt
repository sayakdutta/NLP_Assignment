 
 Cameron,
  
 I'm glad you found the bulletin board.  The units are in MMBtu/d, the month should be specified by the column.  
  
 Thanks,

 Kimberly, 
 
 As per our conversation this afternoon, I was able to find the information on the unsubscribed capacity portion of your website but I am unsure of the units.  For instance at the Loc Name "PNM RIO PUERCO BI-DEL" there appears to 70000 available for delivery.  Is this MMBtu/d, MMBtu/month, Mcf?? Any help would be appreciated.
 
 Thank-you,
