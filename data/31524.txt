 Why doesn't Enron promote from within.... same old story. It just took a
 long time before EOL had the markets out there.
 
 I leave Tuesday evening. There is a dinner Monday night... you should get
 an
 invite... since Goodell has to do the family thing... as always.
 
 What happen to Dick??
 
 
     
 
 
 Scott is your main man - I guess.  I don't know if he is going to keep
 doing it or if he's going to hire an analyst.  I think Susan will be doing
 Texas Eastern.  Mr. Goodell will be going to the CGAS/TCO meeting on
 Tuesday.  I may be going Tues afternoon.
 
 When do you leave Houston?

 Vickey told me yesterday was her last day. I see Scott Neal is on Tenn Z0.
 
 There are no quotes out there... just for Enron's info.
 
 I'll be in town this weekend.. going to TCO/Gulf meeting Monday and
 Tuesday.
 Hope to see you.
 
 Hope your back and other aches are okay.
