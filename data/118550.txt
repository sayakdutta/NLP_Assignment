 Aquila and others continue to transact under the wrong company (ie physical 
 under the financial company and financial under the physical company).  I 
 have had several conversations with them concerning this however, they have 
 requested that we provide som sort of legal framework which will allow them 
 to transact under one ID for seperate companies.  Mark has discussed this 
 with outside counsel and are comfortable with such an arrangement.  
 Essentially the document would state that physical transactions done under ID 
 XXXXXXX will be with Aquila Energy Marketing and financial transactions done 
 under ID XXXXXXXX will be with Aquila Risk Management.  
 
 Please let me know if we can proceed with this type of document.  The only 
 other alternatives at this point are to 1.) assign transacations as they are 
 completed 2.) remove execute rights according to the company.
