 
 Tough times - and lots of work.  I know that you must be swamped, and that you had already been immersed in what was believed to be a tough budget process.  I am sure it is even tougher now!
 
 Got a call from Melissa Becker today regarding retention.  On Rick's behalf, she was asking about London operations.  I assume that you have covered that.  Her specific question related to Mike.  I told her that you and I hadn't talked, and that my assumption was that you had this one covered.  Accurate?  
 
 
 Take care.
