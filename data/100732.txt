 
 Hi Mum!  Well, I mustered the courage to start my bathroom painting project 
 yesterday.  I chose a medium blue that looks very nice.  Guess who helped 
 me?  Bill!  He got pretty enthusiastic with that roller.  So we were able to 
 knock it out in about 3 hours.  There was a lot of woodwork to tape off.  
 Tonight I will finish the tub area, which needed some 
 repair/caulking/spackling.  Now I am anxious to do the bedroom, but probably 
 will not get to it until next month.  Maybe you will be able to help me 
 decide on a color when you are here this weekend.  I'm torn between "Happy 
 Yellow" and a lighter version of the blue I used in the bathroom.  If I 
 decide to paint any of the downstairs, I believe I will entrust that work to 
 the professionals.
 
 Got 4 tickets to the dance performance.  Since Bill seems to genuinely enjoy 
 dance, I invited him.  So that leaves us with one ticket.  If you would like 
 to invite someone, just let me know; otherwise maybe one of my friends around 
 here will join us.
 
 Hope your weekend project was a success.  
 
 Talk to you soon!
 
 Love,
 S.
