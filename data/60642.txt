 Paul received the standard business reorg package as a consequence of the storage group under Jean Mrha being dissolved.   Based on his service and salary, Paul will receive 59,232.92 (assuming he signs a waiver and release)
 
 Additionally, Scott Hendrickson, after 30 days of looking for a position (requested by Lavo), will receive 32,691.38 (assuming he signs a separation agreement).  He was terminated for performance.

 If anyone ever gets from us a leaving package I or John want to know about it.
 
 Thanks
