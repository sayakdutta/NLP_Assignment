 I was recently informed of a risk-reducing strategy that we have on the 
 Merchant Asset portfolio.  It seems that we have a vertical bear spread 
 hedging our holdings of Hanover Compression.
 
 Since these holdings represent about 10% of the porfolio, I felt that 
 parametric VaR would not be accurate enough.  As a result, I have changed the 
 model to a Monte Carlo simulation with the following details:
 
 Following my conversation with Vince, I changed the method of parameter 
 estimation to RiskMetrics standard (assume a zero mean and estimate daily 
 volatilities and correlations using exponential weighting with a 0.94 lambda).
 
 I use the Cholesky decomposition to produce correlated random normals, which 
 I then use to simulate Geometric Brownian Motion prices.
 
 I treat the Hanover Compression stock holding and bear spread together as a 
 synthetic short put at 34 and long call at 92.  I do full revaluation of the 
 options with the Black-Scholes.  I keep volatility and the interest rate 
 constant for the sake of computational speed.
 
 I write my Monte Carlos through VBA and formulas in Excel, so this model does 
 not need Crystal Ball.
