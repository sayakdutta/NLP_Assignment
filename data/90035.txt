On-Peak in FRCC, however, I will be moving down some, particularly in the shoulder months starting in 03 as alot of combined cycles are added in Florida by both utilities and merchant players.
 
  
     
 Kevin -
 
 Are you comfortable with your FLA off-peak marks?  When I look at them as relative basis values to SOCO/ENT they look ok, but when I look at them as rates they may appear low as that region definitely has some building to do and everything incremental should be gas.  They are probably fair - just wanted to check and see if you were comfortable.
