 You are invited to participate in one of three workshops designed to
 solicit input into training issues which will help NERC understand what
 operating and marketing personnel feel they need in the way of training
 programs and study materials.
 
 Attached is the announcement and registration form. The announcement is
 also posted at the following NERC web site:

 Let me know if you have any questions.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Glenda Rodriguez
 
 
 Please note there is still room available for all three workshops.
