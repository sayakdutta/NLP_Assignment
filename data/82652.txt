 
 I'm sorry, I came looking for you on Friday at 3:00 p.m.  I thought I had 
 responded to you and indicated that Friday at 3:00 was okay, but I checked my 
 e-mails and discovered that I did not respond.   Anyway, my fault, what's 
 good for you next week?  ( I promise I'll respond when you e-mail me back, 
 instead of just putting it on my calendar.)
 
 Thanks
