 
 Ed:  As I mentioned to you, CP want to utilize as much of the Cargill, 
 Incorporated ISDA as possible.  Cargill, Incorporated was hightly negotiated 
 and does not provide for affiliate setoff.  DO YOU WANT TO APPROVE THE SAME 
 LANGUAGE FOR CP?  
 
 Please let me know so that we can send the amended master to CP.
 
 Thanks.  Sara
