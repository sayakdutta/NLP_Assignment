 
 Hey guys - welcome home!  At least I assume you're home by now.  How was the 
 trip?  I heard a bit about the departure but with any luck it must have 
 gotten better.  Any hope you took digital pictures?
 
 I have already told Linda but I wanted you both to know how great I thought 
 your wedding was.  There is no doubt in my mind that it was the most special, 
 beautiful, fun wedding I've ever been to.  Magical doesn't seem like too 
 strong a word.  Thank you very much for letting me be part of it.  It's been 
 about 30 years since I had been to that part of the world - it's easy to see 
 why you enjoy it so much.  
 
 I was serious about sailing in the Caribbean at Thanksgiving.  If you are 
 still interested, we really need to start planning right away.  I tentatively 
 booked a boat but the real difficulty may be in finding flights - it is a 
 busy travel season.  Just let me know.
