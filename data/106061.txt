 
 Please call.  Brent and I missed you this morning.  Here's the extent of what 
 I was able to find out.  We called Andrea Bertone and left word.  I think 
 she's calling Brent (as I was on a conference call when she rang back).  Pat 
 Cini will join our Friday morning meetings.  Is Michael Herman taking over 
 Brazil financial?  SS

 pat, sorry, but we did go forward with this very small deal before taking all 
 the normal credit provisions.  The deal is not signed yet, and is still 
 "technically" awaiting management approval.  Please work with Remi Collogne 
 and or Gustavo to get information on this company.  let me know how I can 
 help.  thanks 
 
 





  
 Christine:
 
 Let me know if you have heard about a 10 year deal that Brazil did.  Gustavo 
 advised that they are going to buy 1.7MW (24x7)at 40.00Real from a sugar mill 
 beginning in May 2000.  The purchase price is suppose to be inflation 
 adjusted starting 2001.  ECE will be selling this power to Elektro at a 
 biomass pricing that is government controlled and adjusted annually.  The 
 price to Elektro is approximately 80.00Real.   
 
 I believe that this deal may have been already executed, but have not 
 received a response from Brazil yet.  I have not had a chance to review the 
 sugar mill's profile and make any type of credit assessment.
 
 Let me know if you have heard from Brazil on this and whether we have a 10 
 year power curve from them.
 
 Regards,
 
 Pat
