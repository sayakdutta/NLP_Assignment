 
 Looks like it is ok to keep the same.
 
 How's the GE master form agreement coming along?  When do you think we will 
 have a draft?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay

 Kay-
 
 Lee is correct, I'm the one that marked up the performance section.  Since we 
 were writing a breakout agreement for Austin, I thought I would make it apply 
 to site specific performance as well.  Thought it might be helpful.  However, 
 I was not aware of the agreement that Bruce and Lee had.  If Lee really wants 
 to keep the original guarantee, I can live it.

 Kay,
 
 The guaranteed performance values in section 10 have been edited, & I'm not
 sure why.
 
 I'm not sure who to go to on the Technical side of your team.  Maybe Eric
 Booth can explain, but months ago Bruce Golden and I discussed whether the
 guarantee values should be revised for site conditions. The decision was
 made that a site  specific guarantee was not needed, that it would be
 acceptable to correct for the difference in elevation (sea level to 435 ft)
 and exhaust losses (6" to 12" backpressure).  
 
 I'd prefer to stay the course.  However, if there is now a compelling reason
 to change, I'd like to request the guarantee based on the revised basis
 conditions given in Appendix A and verify these performance values.    (We
 don't have a record of supplying these numbers.) Our guarantee process
 usually takes several days to a week, depending on the backlog of requests
 in house.
 
 Please let me know asap.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Lee

    Pursuant to Kay Mann's instructions, attached please find a
 clean copy of the most recent version of the City of Austin Agreement
 (the second document below), as well as a blackline showing changes from
 the last version circulated on December 14.  The Agreement deletes
 references to specific performance guarantees for combined cycle plants.
 The Agreement now has the exhibits rolled in. To complete the agreement,
 we need to include the date of execution, the addresses and contacts for
 Sections 25.1 and 25.3, and Exhibit H-2.
