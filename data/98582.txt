 Richard and Elizabeth:  
 While I was away on vacation, Steve Hall included this statement in a status 
 report to me;  
 
 " >While you were gone I learned a new one from Smith Day, which involves 
 submitting bids for less than one MW, i.e., .0005 MW.  Because of a glitch in 
 the ISO's rounding system, the MW get rounded down, but the payment gets 
 rounded up.  Playing this game is worth about $9000/day. "
 
 9,000 X 365 = 3,250,000.
 
 Let's discuss.  ----cgy
