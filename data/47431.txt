 Samantha sent them to counterparty's outside counsel on 3/15/01.  I just 
 spoke to Maureen Donley-Hoopes at outside counsel and asked her to fax me the 
 signature pages of the ISDA and counterparty's guaranty to me ASAP.  Once we 
 get those Russell will be a happy man and we can send a confirm out under the 
 ISDA.  I'll let you know as soon as we get the fax in.
