 posting, and added in a sentence saying ties will be decided by lottery (but 
 omitted reference to the lottery provisions of our tariff this time).
 
 My only other comment is that I think the group needs to discuss beforehand 
 how a shipper's request for alternate points is going to be treated.  As 
 currently drafted, this notice prohibits shippers from conditioning bids on 
 use of alternate points at the bid rate, which calls into question our 
 granting the winning bidder use of alternate points at a discount.  If we do 
 intend to let the winning bidder shippers use alt. points at a discounted 
 rate, we should take this statement out (end of paragraph 5).  
 
 If we're still living in a max. rate world, though, this really is not much 
 of a concern since use of the alternate points would also be at max. rate.
 
 Any questions -- give me a call.
 
 S.
