 
 I have received an inquiry through one of our employees (David Barr)
 from Chicago Partners, a consulting firm in Chicago. They specialize, among 
 other
 things, in regulatory economics and could be useful as experts in our 
 discussions with
 the government and regulatory agencies.
 
 One of the partners, Christopher Culp, is a well known commodity markets
 expert.
 
 Please, let me know if you are interested.
