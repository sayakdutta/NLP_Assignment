 
 Joe,
 
 We are working on the JCC project with the crude desk (Vasant
 Shanbhogue and Nelson Neal are involved in the project).
 We are meeting with Marc de la Roche tomorrow to present
 our findings about pricing and hedging.
 
 We shall be glad to send you the presentation and walk your through the slides over
 the phone.

 P.S. You are right. The margins are fat. It looks like a great opportunity.
 
  
     
 Another JCC possibility as well.  
 
 I don't know if you have looked too closely at the MS price sheet that I sent over the other day, but we calculate, based on Enron's curves, that they are earning upwards of USD .50/bbl.  Clearly the effects of little competition.
