 Mark:
 
 Recently, you requested Jim provide written feedback on David.  
 Unfortunately, due to the large number of requests received, Jim is unable to 
 provide written feedback.  However, you can either call Jim (x3-3354) or set 
 up a meeting if you would like to receive verbal feedback.
 
 Thanks, 
 Lucy
