 plan? 
 Michelle, I don't know if I have the final restated plan document.  I'm not sure what changes anyone made after my last draft.  I don't even know what the design decision  was regarding the formula.  I think that Kriste has it or Mary Joyce should have it. 
 The best way to incorporate the revised paragraph into the plan would be to cut and paste the revised paragraph over the existing paragraph B.
