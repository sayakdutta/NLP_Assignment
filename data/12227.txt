 help.  Why are we collecting so much groundwater.  Im concerned that charges 
 for twice weekly disposal may be perceived as excessive, even though the 
 costs are reasonable.  Are we trying to dewater or what?  Other than that, I 
 dont mind ensuring the protection of the upstream spring and think we should 
 get busy on the well installations.  Do you think this will do it with 
 respect to no more wells needed.  Id like to get to that position as quickly 
 as possible.
