 
 Hi, Jan!  I hope you are all doing well.  I'm sorry to hear that your mother 
 is ill.  I'm sure it's frustrating to be so far away.  
 
 I know you have other things on your mind right now, but I wanted to check 
 with you about our visiting this summer.  We were thinking about the second 
 week in July.  We have not made any definitive plans.  Let me know if that 
 will work.  If this summer doesn't work, we can always try next summer...
 
 Take care.
 
 Susan
