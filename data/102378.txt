 
 Hey girl!  Thanks for the book and the CD.  I lazed around the house enjoying 
 both yesterday morning.  After we played tennis, Bill took me to Berryhill 
 for fish tacos (al fresco) and later that evening we went to yet another 
 Christmas party, where I drank champagne (but luckily not too much).  So it 
 was a good birthday.  
 Have a good day!
 
 
 
 
 

   
  
 
 
 Hi Susan! I meant to call you yesterday but somehow I never did. Hope you
 will accept a late Happy Birthday from me! I am assuming that mum passed
 along our gift to you whilst we were in Houston last. I hope so! Anyway, I
 hope that you had a good day and that Bill took you out for a nice dinner.
 
 Except for maybe a lipstick for the mem's,(was totally confused by the
 selection at the HEB - need help) this elf is finished with Christmas
 shopping. Good to have it done. Picked up some sox at Tar-zhay for her to
 wear w/ the clogs.
 
 More later!
