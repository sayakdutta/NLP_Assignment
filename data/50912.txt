 
 Chris,
 
 We don't have yet any report on Broadband that might help you, developed 
 internally
 by my group. We are working on a tutorial and we shall send you a copy when
 it's ready.
 
 The person who can give you an introduction  to this market is Ravi 
 Thuraisingham.

 Vince:
 
  I am working now in EES as the Chase National Account manager and  am 
 developing new products to sell Chase. One of the products  I am working on 
 integrates the provision of broad band with  a  package of   computer 
 hardware and software for a company's employees. 
 I can explain more if you are interested.
 
 I understand you put together a  report on Broadband which has helped educate 
 people as to the technology and economics. Can I get a copy?.
 
 Also do you have any analyses on Chase that might help me  detect other 
 opportunities?
 
 Is there anyone on your staff with whom I should talk?
 
 Thanks
 
 Chris
