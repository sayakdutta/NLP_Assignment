 
 Ehud,
 
 November 15 is a bad day for me. I shall be in San Antonio for our
 annual management conference.
 Practically everybody who  counts in Enron will be there.
 
 Still no response from Louise. I shall catch her tomorrow
 in person.

 Vince,
 
 Good morning.
 
 Further to our conversation thereon during your Austin visit 10/11, I am
 writing at this time to inquire whether we might schedule a circa 7 p.m.
 dinner next Wed. 11/15, to include the participation of your Enron Training
 arm colleague.  We could then discuss UT partcipation in Enron training
 activities, as well as the forthcoming Spring 2001 Conference.
 
 Best,
 Ehud
