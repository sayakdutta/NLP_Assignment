 
 Well, I only went to the gym once last week, and then pretty much ate and 
 slept all weekend, so I'm feeling like a pasty white blob of winter blubber. 
 I'm just starting to get "homesick" for Maui, so Mexico will come not a 
 minute too soon. Also, Molly and I went to see this movie last night, Requiem 
 for a Dream. It was psychotic! It made me feel like moving to a farm and 
 becoming a marathon-running vegan or something. Truly a horrible, horrible 
 depiction of modern-day addictions and the messed-up way our society quells 
 them.
 
 So, needless to say, I am MAKING myself go to the gym today.
 
 Anna's job opportunity sounds great, although I'm bummed we won't be roomies 
 anytime soon. Maybe I'll get transferred to Enron's Colorado office.
