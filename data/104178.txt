 Sara,
 
 We have about 4 new people in our mid marketing group, and I've been putting 
 together meetings with Credit, Risk and the Back Office.
 I think we're about ready for the Legal perspective and I would like to have 
 maybe 30 minutes of your time next week if its possible.  
 
 
 Regards,
 
 Lucy
 
 P.S.
 Hope you're doing well.
