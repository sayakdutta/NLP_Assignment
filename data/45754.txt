 
 Can you forward alison the template for an omnibus swap.  The attached 
 appears to be an EOL template.

 The Confirmation I'm wanting is the other form you gave us which under 
 General Terms starts with "Notional Quantity per Determination Period". Do 
 you have it? Thanks.
 
 
     
 That's what I just sent you....

 Thanks Tana. Do you also have the Confirmation (SWAP) form that said "EOLID"? 
 I think that was the form we understood you to say was the "preferred" form. 
 Thanks again.
 
 
     
 The omnibus swap below, plus this Annex A make up the "omnibus" confirm.

 Tana,
 
 Here's a Draft I had in my personal file.  I thought this would be easier 
 than deleting the coding from the system template
