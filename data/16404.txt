 		CPUC PRESIDENT LYNCH AND COMMISSIONER DUQUE STATEMENT 
 		California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) President Loretta Lynch and 
 Commissioner Henry Duque today issued a statement regarding revisions to item 
 8 on the Commissioner agenda of December 21, 2000:
 		We note certain revisions to the Commission's published agenda for December 
 21st. Item 8 has been revised to reflect the scope of options available to 
 the Commission in addressing current financial conditions facing Pacific Gas 
 and Electric and Southern California Edison. The financial problems faced by 
 California's utilities are the result of the failure of the wholesale 
 electric market to ensure just and reasonable prices for this necessity. The 
 Commission need not act on this agenda item on December 21st, but the fact 
 that it is on our agenda allows the Commission to act if necessary. 
 		The financial stability of California's utilities is of paramount importance 
 to California, and to this Commission. The CPUC stands ready to act to 
 protect the financial viability of California utilities. The exorbitant and 
 unjustified prices now being charged in California's electricity market 
 demonstrate the necessity for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) 
 to intervene and control the opportunism of the electricity sellers. FERC 
 must act to solve the underlying market failure so that all energy consumers 
 are assured of reliable delivery of power and protected from exorbitant 
 energy costs. We urge FERC to act immediately. 
 		For information on this item, please contact Harriett Burt, Deputy Chief of 
 Staff for Loretta Lynch at 415-703- 2444, Mary Lou Tousey, 415-703-2593, or 
 Commissioner Carl Wood, 415-703- 2440.
