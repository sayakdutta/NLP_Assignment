 
 Give her 13
 
  
     
 Louise,
 How would you like me to proceed?
 
 Thanks!
 
  
     
 We currently have 13 employees in Upstream Products.  Louise is aware of this and a seat reallocation needs to be done.
 
  
     
 The attached spreadsheet represents a schematic of the ECS 5th floor.  Louise has taken the time to assign locations and number of desks to the various groups.
 
 The Upstream group is located in desks 410-413, 416-419 and 425-426.  I recall that your original request was for 15 spaces, however Louise has allocated 10.  Please assign names to these desks and return to me by end of day Wednesday.  Please include first and last names to assist IT with workstation audits.  
 
 Thanks in advance for your assistance.
 Tammy
