 
 517518 and 517520 have been changed to FPL Energy Power Marketing; and Tom's 
 sticking by his price on 517518. Would you mind sending me Jeff Wallace's 
 phone number if you have it? These guys are still busy trading, so I'd like 
 to take care of it myself if I can.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate
 
 
 
     
 Kate, same thing on this trade. I think it should be FPL Energy Power 
 Marketing b/c I received a confirm on it. Secondly on the confirm it states 
 that hour 0100-0600 is priced at $95.00 and then again at hours 2300-2400. 
 7-22 is priced at $140. However I do not show in the system 1-6 and 23-24 at 
 $95. Did he forget to put in the off peak or is FPL incorrect.
 
 Thanks,
