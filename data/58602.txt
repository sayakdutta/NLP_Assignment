 
 I have a reception that evening (coincidentally with another Rice group -- 
 from the engineering school), so I will not be able to attend.

 Rice recruiting team,
 
 As some of you are aware, Enron is sponsoring  sell weekends (Dec 1 and Dec 
 8) for all the candidates that have received offers.  The Rice team is 
 organizing a dinner for the Jones School candidates this Friday evening (Dec. 
 1) at Tony Ruppe's.  I am looking for 5 to 8 Enron Jones School recruiters to 
 attend the dinner on Friday.  
 
 Please let me know if you will be able to attend.
 
 Thanks,
 Jaime
