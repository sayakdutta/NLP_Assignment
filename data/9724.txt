 
 Thanks for your note.  Sorry that all we managed last week was a wave.  My 
 last trip to London was March of 2000, so I certainly had a very full 
 agenda.  Mike Jordan kept my schedule very full, but productive, and even 
 lunches and dinners were filled with business meetings.  
 
 Do stop by when you are in the office next week.  I should be in town all 
 week.  --Sally

 Hi Sally
 
 Congratulations on your promotion!
 
 I was hoping to congratulate you in person while you were in London - but you 
 seemed really busy.  Every time you walked through our area I was on the 
 phone!
 
 Hope to catch up with you next week when I visit Houston.
 
 Best wishes 
 
 Amita
