 Chad just loves his apple checkboard.  Thanks again for it.
 
 I am still feeling sick.  Last week my Dr. told me its just allergies/asthma, but I'm still feeling puny.  I trying to get in to see if I have a touch of bronchitis or something.
 
 I'm going to forward this little list while I'm thinking of it.  Ordinarily, I'm not one of those people that believes in giving people a gift wish list.  It seems kind of rude and presumptious.  However, given that we may be traveling in the November-December time frame and unable to field the normal questions I receive about what Mr. Chad is into -- I thought I'd provide this list:
 
 Things Chad Says He Wants for Christmas (That Santa isn't bringing) if anyone asks -- not he should expect to get these items (since some cost more than $20)
 
 -Harry Potter Game for Computer (MS-Windows)  (more expensive item)
 -Backyard Football Game for Computer (MS-Windows)
 -Harry Potter Trading Cards
 -Video or DVD of "Cats and Dogs"
 -Harry Potter Snapes Potion Kit (More expensive item)
 -Ultra Grip Nerf Football
 
 Incidentally, Chad is asking Santa for the Harry Potter Legos Set, a Levitating Game and an Air Snare Drum Game.
 
 
 More Later
