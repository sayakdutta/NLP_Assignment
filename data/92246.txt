 
 Hey,
 
 What's going on?  I've had a fabulous day...at least it hasn't been boring.  
 Anything interesting in your world?  
 
 It's the first night and I already want to skip my GMAT class.  I may come 
 visit you before I go to my class.  I don't want to hang around down here 
 until 6.   That is if you aren't too busy today.  
 
 Talk to ya later,
 Robin
