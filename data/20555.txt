 Attached is a final version of the letter faxed today to Loretta Lynch.
 Please call or write if you'd like a faxed copy with the signatures. 
 (And
 lemme know your fax number.)  If this letter needs to be distributed to
 some service list, I will assume an attorney-at-law will perform that
 duty.
