 We were having some retention problems with Jacek for a variety of reasons.  After discussion in London we decided to increase his package.
 
 I believe it is highly unlikely that Jacek would be interested in working out of the Warsaw office for Enron Poland.

 The package is significantly higher than what the industry peers would receive in this position and in this market. I wish we had a chance to discuss this issue internally first.
 
 In case I were to retain him as part of Enron Poland at a later date - I can not justify this level of remuneration as part of my budget.

 I have discussed this with Jacek.  The reason for increasing Jacek's package is retention.

 Has this package been discussed with Jacek yet at all ?
