 
 I am open for luch Wednesday and Thursday.  Let me know which fits your 
 calendar the best.  DK did tell me about the Mark Marin tournament.  If your 
 Mom saved the paper let me have it for reference.  Did you see the Sunday 
 paper RE: the 100 highest paid executives in Houston?

 Good morning Daddy!!!  How are you today?  Did you enjoy your nice long 
 weekend?  Did Debbie tell you about the golf tournament Mark Martin is 
 hosting in New Smyrna the week you'll be there that you can play in or at 
 least watch?  If not, I'll tell you all about it tonight.  Have a great day, 
 and I'll talk to you tonight.  By the way, let me know if you have any days 
 free for lunch this week.  I love you!!
 Love,
 Caron
