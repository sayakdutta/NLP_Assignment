 Hi All, 
 
 Sorry about the delay.  To delete your spool files, please follow these steps:
 
 	
 	1. Menu path: System>Own spool requests
 	2. Check box of spool file to delete 
 	3. Menu path: Spool request>Delete
 	
 or you can go to transaction code SP01.  The attached goes through the steps showing the screens.  
 
 Please instruct your users to delete all spools they do not need and to use the spool function whenever possible rather than rerunning reports, etc.  
 
 Thanks,
 
 Maura
