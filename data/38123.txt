 Today, October 9, 2001, Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) filed an
 application with the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC).
 
 In this application, PG&E proposes a market structure and rules for the
 northern California natural gas industry, beginning 
 January 1, 2003.  PG&E's filing was in response to a recent Commission order
 (Decision 01-09-016), which directed PG&E to file a "Gas Accord II"
 application.
 
 If you have any problems opening these documents, please contact me at (415)
