 Debra,
 
 Just spoke with Lupe Gonzales at Kinder Morgan who agreed to amending the GISB Base Contract to make Enron the confirming party.  The customer has not been sending us confirmations in a timely manner.  Details are as follows:
 
 Contract #:  96039682
 Contact:  Lupe Gonzales

 Phone #: (713) 369-9427
 Fax #: (713) 369-9375
 
 If you would like, you can send me the amendment and I will get it out to Lupe.
 
 Thanks,
 Ann
