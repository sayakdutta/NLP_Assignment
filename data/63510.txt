 The next World Economic Forum will be held September 11-13 in Melbourne.  I 
 have received information from the Control Risks Group that several 
 anti-capitalist and anarchist groups are planning major demonstrations to 
 disrupt the proceedings. Like the earlier incidents in Seattle, large-scale 
 clashes between demonstrators and police are expected.
 
 If you or any of your staff members are planning to attend, you might want to 
 consider your personal security when making hotel and local travel 
 accomodations.  Corporate Security can provide local personal security agents 
 if you desire.
 
 Any non-essential travel to Melbourne during this time frame should be 
 rescheduled.
 
 Regards,
 
 Mike Hicks
