 Has anyone begun to address the issues surrounding the EEI product definitions and the new rules associated with "transporting" power across the new RTO/ISO control areas? Upon discussions with parties involved with the Midwest ISO ("MISO") when scheduling power through the MISO control area a party will no longer designate an interface but only a source and a sink and the Control Area will determine the best path through its system. How will this affect the obligations of the products as defined under EEI. In particular how will this affect the "Into" product definition if the buyer and seller no longer have the ability to select an Interface?
