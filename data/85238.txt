 
 Ken,  Attached is the letter.  Please sign and forward the original to Kent 
 Harris via Fedex.  We should request a signature acceptance of the letter and 
 a confirmation receipt of such signature acceptance for our files.
 
 The letter has a header for Crescendo on it.  Not sure if you had stationary 
 for Crescendo yet.
 
 Send a signed copy to me  and I will copy all the Enron CCs.
