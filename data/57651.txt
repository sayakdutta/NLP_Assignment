 Mark Palmer has asked me to send you the attached reactive holding statements 
 in relation to the above.  It has been signed off by everyone here except 
 Michael Brown and John Sherriff, but we do not expect any material changes.  
 The result is due mid-morning London time tomorrow and we will advise you of 
 the outcome as soon as possible thereafter.  
 
 If you have any queries you can reach me tonight on +44 7967 381557.  Thanks.
