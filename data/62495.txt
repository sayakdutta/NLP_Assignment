 Joe, you should come clean on this one - you know what the understanding was ...... At  least for the North American piece maybe not EE&CC.
 
 John, take a look at the DASH - I think I wrote several comments.

 That was a pretty clear answer and pretty speedy too.  Suggest we have a chat at some point Dave on how we move forward on this.

 I am NOT taking the P/L swings or funding this investment.  If there is confusion, let's get together with Dave.

 We have the AIG Highstar Fund in ENA.  As I understand it ENA committed to $12.5M on this with the other 50% coming from EE&CC.  I understand from Dave that you are taking the P&L swings on this fund.  As they are about to pull further on this money (<1m to date), I wondered how you wanted it treating.
 
 Let's discuss
