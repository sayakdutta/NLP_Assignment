       Attached for your review are (i) an execution copy of the Assignment
 of Membership Interest, (ii) a draft of the Swap Termination Agreement, and
 (iii) a draft of the Guaranty Termination Agreement.
 
  I told Michelle Vonderhaar that we would e-mail to her copies of the
 Termination Agreements after you have had a chance to review them.  Please
 let me know when you would like me to send them to her.  Michelle also
 indicated that it would probably take a couple of days to locate someone who
 is able to sign on behalf of Bankers Trust International PLC, which means
 that we will have to execute those documents as of a date after March 28,
 2000.
 
  Please do not hesitate to call should you have any questions.
