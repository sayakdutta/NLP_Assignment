 Sheila tells me that you are working on the docs requested by Global Finance 
 for Turbopark (does this ring a bell?)  If you can get me the docs on this 
 LLC, I'll see if we can pitch the angle Sheila suggested.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay

 Yes please.  I do not know of a single project LLC that is ready to commit to 
 Phase II Turbo Park.  So I suggest we send them corporate docs from 
 Pleasanton Local Reliability  Facility LLC and tell them that all of our 
 LLC's are basically the same.
