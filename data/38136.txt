 Mike, 
 
         I just wanted to shoot you and email to let you know I've spoke with Chris Gaskill about the possibility of making the Daily Cash Trades Report automated.  We are in the process of refining our ability to capture EOL deal data, but I expect we should be able to generate this report for you in the near future.
 
 I understand you are out today, but I'll swing by next week to give you some more information. 
 
 Thanks, 
 
 Dave
