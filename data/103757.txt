 Hi Sara,
 
 Gareth and I were going over the documents this morning and was wondering if
 you have any comments on the revised Swaps (the three currency swaps and the
 two option swaps).  Could you fax me your comments?
 
 Could you also forward to me the Master Agreement btw UBS and Enron and
 Enron's std language with respect to set offs, jurisdiction etc.. (as per
 your e-mail two weeks ago).  Thanks.
