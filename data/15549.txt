 
 Let's discuss further, but I believe that the tariff would be a "generic" one 
 for network service, with the price, terms and conditions dependent upon the 
 size and other attributes of the customer.  Not aware of any negotiated rates 
 available from the US/Mex border to the burner tip in S.D.
 
 Best,

 Jeff,
 
 We've obtained a tariff filing that Sempra made with the CRE in Mexico to 
 determine the transportation rates charged by Sempra International to 
 transport gas in Mexico.  Can you help us determine the transport rate 
 charged to move gas from the California border to the Mexican border through 
 Socal and SDG&E?  I understand that SDG&E may be able to negotiate a rate 
 that includes the fee paid to Socal?  Is that correct?
 
 What I'm trying to determine is what will be the rate for us to obtain a 
 backhaul from a new LNG regas terminal in Mexico, through the Sempra 
 International pipeline in Mexico and through SDG&E, to an end user behind 
 Socal?  Do you know how this works or do you have a suggestion on how we can 
 determine the max rates, plus determine what "actual" rates have been 
 negotiated?  We have discussions with Sempra this friday and want to table 
 the issue of firm backhauls.
 
 Thanks
 
 Kurt
