 
 Thanks very much to all for your assistance.  Is it possible to get some idea 
 of exactly what the amount to be refunded is?  Thanks so much again for your 
 help.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Michelle,
 We have corrected Mr. Dasovich's tuition reimbursement to non-taxable.  Due 
 to SAP configuration, the system will not deduct any taxes from his pay until 
 the total is refunded.  Therefore, on his 8/31 paycheck, he will not have a 
 tax deduction for FICA/SS/MED.
 
 Thanks,
 Andrea

 Hi Andrea,
 
 Jeff Dasovich (508152) received his latest tuition reimbursement on 7/31/00, 
 unfortunately it was not supposed to be taxed.  A letter was sent with his 
 tuition on 4/15/00 that was paid correctly - but I think Gwen forgot to send 
 it with the July claim.   It is being required by his Managing Director, Rick 
 Shapiro, and should therefore not be subject to income tax.  Can you please 
 process a refund for the the taxes that were taken?  I will insure that we 
 send the letter with all future claims.
 
 Should you have any questions, please feel free to contact me on ext 36023.
 
 Regards,
 Michelle
