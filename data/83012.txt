 Attached are initial comments of ENA which were filed Thursday in the Order 
 637 Compliance Filings of the indicated pipelines.  For all other pipelines, 
 we filed plain interventions.
 
 
 Objected to "use it or lose it" provision on alternate primary points on 
 segmented capacity.
 
 
 Protested no tolerance on imbalance based on highest or lowest daily price in 
 the month.
 
 
 Protested additional charge to create a primary point on segmented capacity, 
 forced daily balancing service, and change from unauthorized overrun penalty 
 (which is credited) to a service which is not.  Requested technical 
 conference.
 
 
 Same as Tennessee
