 Just wanted to let you know that we still have not heard from TVA, re dual 
 interconnect with Southern. In the next week or so we will give them a call.  
 On the Gleason facility, TVA has been relatively helpful and has agreed to 
 let us go "commercial" sooner than they otherwise would be required to.  
 Maybe this is a thawing of relations.  Just dreaming.
 
 Talk to you soon.
 
 Hope all is well.
