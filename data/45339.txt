 
 Keep me posted on what you find out from this corporate search company.  I'd 
 be interested to see what prices we can work out.  I am also going to contact 
 Kate Cole and see if she uses anyone special.  If Enron Corp. does and they 
 have negotiated any special rates, maybe we can piggyback off of it.  I'll 
 keep you posted.

 Hope you are well.
 Try "Experion" which provides online and offline services. Search fees range
 from about o35 to o135, and the info you receive varies depending on the
 country concerned. Best thing is for you/Scott/? to speak direct to Mary
 Keane at Experion on 0800 3280059.

 Global counterparty is trying to locate online corporate search companies
 that
 can check company names in Europe and Canada.  In the U.S. we can access
 this
 information via Westmate in Westlaw.  Are either of you aware of any online
 search company, or can you direct me to someone who may be aware of an
 online
 search company, for Canada and Europe?  If there are no online search
 companies
 available, is there a reasonably priced corporate search company that can
 verify
 this information for us?
 
 I appreciate your help.
