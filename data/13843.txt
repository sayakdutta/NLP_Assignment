 Michelle,
 
 We have a reconciling item between SAP Account 0530-10220019 Outflow Clearing and the actual bank balance with Citibank New York 40781075 in the amount of $5,346.46.
 
 On 10-26-01 your forwarded to Treasury Wire Transfer Requests as follows:
 
 Payee                                   Amount     Curr    US Amount
 Denton Wilde Sapte Tokyo   $492,120      JPY    $4,024.20
 Rajah and Tann                   $2,425.65     SGD   $1,332.26
 
 It appears that these two (2) Wire Transfer Requests have not been forwarded to A/P to record the expense.
 
 Please arrange to forward the appropriate documentation to A/P during November 2001.
