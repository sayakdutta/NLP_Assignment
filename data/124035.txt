 
 Can you get with Doug and show him what documentation we do have for Green Mountain?  Also, have you requested from Anita Luong the documentation we sent them for Green Mountain's Schedule C.
 
 Thanks,
 Stacey
 
  
     
 stacey,
 
 As the rules for ERCOT have changed and we are looking at a pool, with sandhill (the Austin Project) right there, this risk is mitigated. Does this suffice as a reason to  unwind this.
 
 Please let me know,
 
 Thanks,
 
 Doug
 
 PS Also wondering about the green mountain one...

 I am still tracking down the Green Mountain documentation, but here is the documentation for LCRA.  I'll forward the rest when I get it.
 
 Thanks,

 I need to get with you regarding the existing schedule C I have for LCRA and for green mountain. I believe market conditions may have changed sufficiently that we can release some of it but I want to reaffirm this by researching the reasons again.
 
 Trust you are well.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Doug
