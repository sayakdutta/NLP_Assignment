 In preparation for his meetings with Commissioner Newsome and Congressman 
 Stenholm, Mark H. has asked for  information including a bullet point list of 
 our key issues and any appropriate background material.  I have prepared a 
 draft issues list which is attached.  Would you please take a quick look at 
 it and see if there is anything you think should be added and then forward it 
 on to Mark?  He probably also needs the final itineraries.  Thanks for your 
 help.
 
 Mark T.
