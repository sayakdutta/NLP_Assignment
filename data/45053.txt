 don't change the report for a 1 month approval only.

 SECOND REQUEST
 
 
 Tana,
 
 
 I was hoping that you could answer a question for me. 
 
 I have a copy of a NYMEX approval letter dated June 5, 2000 plus the 
 interoffice memorandum
 detailing the increase of Henry Hub Natural Gas positions from 17,000 to 
 20,000.  They state that
 this is in regards to the July ONLY contract.
 
 However, the ECT generated report for Limits (the report Moscoso's group 
 creates) dated June 19, 2000 
 doesn't show this increase under the "Delivery Month Limit Amount" column for 
 July NG contracts.
 In turn,  the red flag, "approaching limit", pops up on the 21st.  This is 
 b/c  the limit is still at 17,000 instead
 of 20,000; the red flag probably wouldn't have popped up if the limit had 
 been raised.  
 
 Tell me your thoughts.
 
 Thank you so much for all of your help.
 If you have any questions please give me a call, x31684.
 
 Sincerely, 
 
 Jack Ehrig
