 
 I want playoff tickets but am undecided about next year.
 
  
     
 I have gotten the form to sign up and pay for 2001 playoff tickets.  All the
 other participants have agreed to join in.  We will have some sort of
 lottery to determine ticket usage.  Unused tickets will be credited to next
 years season tickets.
