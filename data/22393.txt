 A bit of good news:
 
 Of the $2.582 MM payable to Bear, Stearns in conjunction with their advisory 
 work on our behalf in selling our position in FirstWorld Communications last 
 February, a total of $2.251 MM was accrued in March of this year.
 
 The net P&L impact will therefore be limited to $331,123.
 
 Regards,
 
 MLM
