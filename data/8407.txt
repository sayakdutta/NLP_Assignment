My understanding is that there are only a handful of people who are involved in managing the invoicing efforts through the outsource providers.  We will know this week exactly which positions would come under wholesale, and we will evaluate whether or not the people will move with those functions.  I don't think we are in danger of getting Mark back.  --Sally 
 
  
     
   I am concerned that Mark has gone back into a group that we will end up with From Evan Hughes.
 
 Wouldn't that be ironic!
 
 I am not sure which piece Bob Hurt is responsible for, but I know he works for Evan.
