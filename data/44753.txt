 
 Larry Gagliardi has been talking to Valero Marketing and Supply Company about 
 doing some gas crack business, and it appears Valero  will not trade with us 
 under the current form of Master Swap Agreement we have in place with them.  
 They will only trade under their form of ISDA Master, a copy of which is 
 attached below.  I spoke to their lawyer, Kim Bowers, who is very nice, and 
 she asked us to make our comments to their form by email.   After talking to 
 Tanya while you were out, it appears that we need to revisit their credit 
 situation since the credit under our existing master swap is quite old.  We 
 will try to work on reviewing the legal terms while we wait to get the credit.

 Dale, Pat  Markey referred me to you. Valero sent me this request, can you 
 process it or tell me who can?

 Thanks for your call this morning.  I was in the middle of legging some gas
 cracks and had to go.
 
 Before we begin trading with you, we need to execute an ISDA.  I am
 attaching a copy of our standard schedule.  We have this agreement in place
 with all of the major dealers; and so, in general, we will not accept
 substantial changes to the agreement, particularly with regard to credit
 terms.
 
 Again,  thanks for your call, and I look forward to dealing with you in the
 future.
 
 John
