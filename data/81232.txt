 Jon, 
 
 Since the Time Execption System has been disconnected Tricia has asked that we manually record the days off people request.  
 Chad had requested Friday August 3rd as a Friday off and Monday August 6th - Friday August 10th as vacation days before the system was disconnected.  
 Unfortunately, I can no longer acces the system to see if his days off were approved.  He made his request prior to Zufferli's transition, so I am unsure if you are to approve his days or if it is John.
 
 If you could me know if his days are approved, that would be great.
 
 Thank-you
 Carlee
