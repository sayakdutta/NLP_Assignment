 
 Saturday was fun - it was nice I think for all of us to go to the shower 
 together.  That was a nice group of women - and fun.  
 
 Cara did tell me about the scrapbook idea and I think that it sounds good.  
 Tell me what I can do to help you, but I am probably shorter on time than 
 anything.  But if I can get you get addresses or whatever, let me know.  
 
 Payment plan sounds fine.  I am not worried about the timing on that, so 
 don't start this until you feel that it makes sense for you and your family.  
 With the Viviance thing, you may prefer to defer the start of this until a 
 little more certainty is on the horizon.  I can't think of a better place for 
 the money to be invested than in you and your family.  
 
 Austin would be fun - but I am glad that Houston is a reasonable distance for 
 a day or weekend trip.  Not quite the same as being in town, though.  Maybe 
 someday we will be there!  --Sally 
 
 
 
 
 
 

    
 
 
 Hey,
 ?
 It was so fun being  with you on Saturday.? It is always nice when someone 
 else spills--it is  usually me....
 Actually do wish you  were closer...although I am grateful that you are no 
 further than  Houston.
 ?
 What did you think  of the scrapbook idea for Mom and Dad?? That is something 
 that I could do  that would involve labor--will not be able to make a huge 
 contribution  $-wise.? (If Cara did not pass on the scrapbook idea to you let 
 me  know!)
 ?
 Also, setup an  automatic payment each month to begin to pay you back.? It is 
 a fairly  paltry sum ($35) at this point but wanted to at least get 
 started....hopefully  will be able to increase it at some soon in the future.
 ?
 Cindy
