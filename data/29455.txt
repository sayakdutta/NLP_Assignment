 I think I beat your deadline for internal distribution, but we need a bit 
 more time to make sure this approach will work.  In particular, Julia and 
 Rick need to take a quick look at the true up mechanism and  I need to go 
 back through it one more time to make sure I haven't forgotten something and 
 to clean it up.  I look forward to your comments.  DF

 I would agree with Paul, unless Drew thinks we can get the agreement out of 
 here in the next 30-40 minutes.
 
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 

  
  
  In order to comply with the request we have made to P G  & E of a 12:00  
 P.M. CST deadline, Chris Chung of P G & E has advised that our proposal has 
 to be submitted to him by Noon today in order to effect a  wire transfer by 
 the Monday deadline. Drew is close in the completion of generating the 
 Agreement, however, with the internal review and approval process, it is 
 doubtful we can achieve the timetable needed by P G  & E. It would be my 
 recommendation that we extend the deadline from Monday, January 29 at Noon to 
 Tuesday, January 30 at Noon. This would permit our internal review with the 
 expectation of sending P G & E our Agreement by Monday morning and allowing 
 time for their review. I have spoken to Drew and he is comfortable with this 
 approach. Additionally, in my conversation with Chung, I indicated that our 
 approach and proposal would be for P G & E to wire transfer the necessary 
 funds prior to our providing transportation for February and then payment 
 would be expected to be made for the January transportation on the 
 appropriate due date in February. (Approximately the tenth )
 
  Please advise your comments at your earliest conveniece.
 
  Thanks and Regards.
