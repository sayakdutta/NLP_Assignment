 I need your help...  I did a quick comparison for the 2000 and 2001 budget 
 and I am showing a significant increase from last year.  Did we have an 
 increase in headcount?  I do not know your actual budget for 2000.  I used 
 the information for the last 5 months of 2000 budget to estimate for the year 
 (see 2000 Budget tab in the attached file).  The attached file contains the 
 following tabs:
 
  Budget vs Budget Comparison of 2000 vs 2001
  Allocation  Allocation - please allocate the rest of the 21.7% to ENA
  2000 Budget  Estimated 2000 budget based on the last 5 months information
  Research  2001 budget
 
 The calculation for taxes and benefits does not equal to the calculation in 
 your template (Corp).  Plus, I have to add A&A overhead cost that Corp will 
 bill us for A&A program (line 78).  Can we meet to discuss the allocation to 
 ENA and the increase in plan?  I am open all week except for Wednesday 
 between 10 and 11.  Thank you.
