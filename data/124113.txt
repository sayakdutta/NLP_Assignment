 Frank,
 
 We were just informed by Norman Lee's group that ENPower is going to put out a new instrument type code called 'TRANSMISSION' and it basically is a kind of SPREADOPTION, so we will modify the code and capture them as SPREADOPTION.
 
 Also we were told that we should handle one existing instrument type code INDEX-OPTION as SPREADOPTION too.  INDEX-OPTION has been captured as OPTION so far.  We will also make the code change for this.
 
 Anytime when ENPower introduces new instrument type code in the future, we need to be informed because there are 15 - 20 instruemnt type codes existing in ENPower system and we need to convert them into one of the six instrument type codes in RisktRAC.
 
 I am going to make the changes tomorrow.
 
 Regards,
 
 Wei
