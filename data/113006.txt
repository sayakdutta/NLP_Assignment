     Thanks, Larry.  What is the date of this document?  Are there  ongoing settlement talks with any party or the staff?
 
     Here's the most  recent document that I've seen.  I am not aware of any agreement  yet. 

 
      Larry, is there a proposed  settlement in this case that is circulating?  I
 just heard a rumor,  and our clients are clamoring to know.  If there is such
 a settlement  document, could you email it to  me?
