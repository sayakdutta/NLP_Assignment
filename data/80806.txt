 Dear Mr. Lay:
 
 Because you were recognized Business Week in 1999  for "taking Enron into
 the red-hot communications industry" by "developing an intelligent network
 platform to facilitate online business and building a market for trading
 bandwidth", we'd like to get your opinion on how we can contribute to your
 initiative.
 
 TBD Networks is a Secure VPN Management software company here in Silicon
 Valley. We believe Enron could benefit from using our highly scalable
 software to manage VPNs Enterprise-wide by:
 
 1) Speeding up the setup and provisioning time for tens of thousands of
 VPNs.
 2) Uniquely Vendor-Independent: Supporting all types of VPNs (Remote
 Access/Site-to-site/Extranet), based on equipment, products and technologies
 from Cisco IOS, PIX, Altiga, Nortel and Check Point.
 3) Reducing training and support needs by using our easy-to-use, web-based
 GUI based on high-level policies, hiding low-level, vendor-specific
 interfaces.
 4) Providing significantly higher levels of security and control VPNs via
 advanced features such as random policy auditing and proactive service
 monitoring.
 
 We would be very interested in meeting with someone at Enron to find out how
 you would like to proceed. Who would you suggest we contact?
 
 Sincerely,
 Simon Stokes
 Director of Sales
 TBD Networks
