 All-
 
 Please forward this message to the appropriate members of your groups.
 
 Risk Analytics has created a new inbox to handle Risktrac requests that have typically been sent directly to one or more of those individuals included in the Cc. line above.  Effective immediately please send all new book requests, curve requests and Risktrac related questions/issues to Risk Analytics, a new addressee in the global address book. We will manage your requests from this new location. Note - do not use the Risk Analytics and Benchmark Reports id,  also in the global address book.
 
 Also - Burton McIntyre has left the group and will no longer be handling Risktrac related requests.
 
 Thanks for your cooperation in this matter.
 
 Regards
 
 Keith Considine
