 
 John, I just spoke with Dan Walker, Vice President  of Development for the 
 Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation about Enron's initiative for a corporation 
 partnership.  After we had discussed our interest and desire and what 
 opportunities are available with the Foundation for Enron, Dan stated that 
 will be visiting with the Foundation's CEO next week and one of the issues to 
 be discussed will be development of  an MOU or Agreement between Enron and 
 the RMEF.  Looks like things are beginning to progress.
 
 Im having quite a bit of interest from some of the Houston based Enron 
 employees about how they can get involved.  Any suggestions on how I can 
 "advertise" opportunities within the Corporation for employee involvement 
 with the RMEF?
