 are you using the same format as midyear, and how many people do you need? 
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
    
 Jeff,
 I am following up on the voicemail I left you on Thursday October 5th, 
 requesting a recommendation for a Director and Vice President to represent 
 Analyst and Associates in the final 2000 PRC.  Due to promotions and 
 additions to the Associate and Analyst Programs, we have an additional slot 
 for both the Associate PRC and Analyst PRC that we would like to fill with an 
 EGM participant.  This will keep the distribution throughout the business 
 units equitable.  
 
 We would like to finalize this by Friday, October 13th in order to load the 
 PEP system and communicate to the A/A pool members.  Please forward your 
 choice for Global Markets representation to me by this date or contact me to 
 discuss.  Thanks so much for your continued support.
