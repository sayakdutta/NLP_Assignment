 I wanted you to be aware of the REASON for the holdup on your FX online 
 product.  We are trying to resolve this issue as quickly as possible.  Sara

 Your summary is correct based on information to date (in this regard the 
 agreement between ENA and EEFT still requires amendment in respect of RMT and 
 I undertake to get this done). 
 
 However, please note that there have been some last minute changes in the 
 Japanese tax advice, received I understand only as of last night. Susan Musch 
 will be following up on these changes at a meeting today with Sheila Glover 
 and Darren Delage, and has undertaken to keep you appraised of the position. 
 The effect of the change would be to permit RMT to be the principal for the 
 Japanese FX desk, with a Japanese entity acting as agent to arrange the 
 transactions. 
 
 Best regards
 Janine
 
 
 
 

 
  
 Janine:
 
 With respect to the attached (internal) FX product for EOL, I just wanted to 
 verify with you that internal counterparties should transact on EOL with:
 
 (1)  RMT  (as principal for Houston FX desk)
 
 (2)  EEFT as agent for RMT (as principal for London FX desk).  In this 
 regard, was the services agreement between ENA and EEFT ever extended to 
 include RMT for internal trades? 
 
 (3)  Enron Japan Corp. (as principal for Tokyo FX desk)
 
 There appears to be some confusion since our meeting of November 3.  Thanks.  
 Sara
