 Saturday, May the 20th looks good.
 I shall be in NYC May the17th through 19th (flying back on Friday).
 There are several good movies I would like to see.
 We can connect later next week to select one.
 
 Take care,
 
 Vince
 
 
 
 
 
 

    
 
 Vince,
 It was nice to see you and hear you speak the other day.  I am sorry we
 didn't get to  visit more.  You are a "popular" guy!
 
 How does Saturday, May 20, 2000 look for dinner and a movie with us?
 
 Let me know.
 
 Jana
