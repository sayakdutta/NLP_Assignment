 
 Folks:
 My apologies.  This is not proofed, but I wanted to make sure that everyone 
 had a chance to review and comment.  Apologies for any unintentional 
 omissions and errors.  I think it tracks closely with the direction agreed to 
 on the call today.  All comments are encouraged and welcome.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
