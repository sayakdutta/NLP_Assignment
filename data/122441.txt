 We'll be back with you soon, I hope.  :>)
 
 Thanks, Kim. 
 
  
     
 Response number 2 - it would be for myself, Davis and my assistant Terri Bachand.

 Kevin,
 
 Donna and I are working on the floor plan.  We have you slotted to move with us (although we don't know exactly where yet), but we were not sure if we needed to make space for anyone else that works for you.  An assistant?  Davis Thames?
 
 Please advise.
 
 Thanks,
 Kim.
