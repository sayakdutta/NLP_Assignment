 Yair:
 
 Attached is my redline.  Call me so that we can discuss the remaining
 issues, including:
 
 (1)  Calculation Agent.  We believe that the existing dispute mechanism is
 adequate.
 
 (2)  Procedures for Entering into Transactions.  There is no procedure for
 dual confirms.  This is too confusing.
 
 (3)  Transfer.  We cannot agree to your assignment provision as it is too
 subjective.
 
 The other changes were not substantive.

 Sara, any thoughts on my comments ISDA I sent out last week?
 
 
 
     
 
 Sara, I have good news, I think we are very close to executing this baby.
 
 I am attahcing comments to the ISDA.  They reflect comments by our outside
 cousel which highlight the differences between this contract and the side
 letter/ML ISDA.  They are not much.  I have also made some changes directly
 on their draft where I either concurred with Enron or needed to make some
 of my own changes.  Pls review and let me know what you think.
 
 I will be leaving the office soon, so if we can wrap it up tomorrow that
 would be great (I'm out Monday for Passover).

 Yair:
 
 Attached is a blacklined (against the Enron North America Corp. draft of
 3/15/01) Schedule and Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex.  I
 have tried to incorporate the essence of the March 19, 2001 "swap side
 letter agreement."  Please call me to discuss as it would be nice to
 finalize by April 6.  Thanks.
