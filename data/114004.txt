 
 Please set up Jason Kaniss with a stack manager login and password effective ASAP.  He will be trading US East Power and US Natural Gas.  All transactions under his login should go into EPMI Mid West risk book.  Jason works for me on the MidWest desk and is in training to be the new short term SERC trader at the beginning of next year.  If you have any questions, please call me at  x 3-9684.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Fletcher Sturm
 
 p.s.  I'd like him to be able to get started tomorrow (Thur.) morning 6:00 am, if possible.
