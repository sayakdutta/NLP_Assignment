 Hey Debra, how are you?  The guy next to me was searching the enron web page
 and so I thought I would check in a see what is going on.  I am on page
 30-35 of my seminar paper.  I have about 15 more pages to go.  I found a
 place in Berkeley for the summer too.  I hope Richard is doing well and you
 are taking care of yourself.  Please tell everyone hello.
