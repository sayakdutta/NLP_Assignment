 FYI.  Attached is a copy of the Project Why status presentation that will be 
 made next week at Stan's May 9 staff meeting.  The purpose of the 
 presentation was to present a list of brainstorming ideas from an Apr. 16 
 offsite session to GPG management & get some preliminary feedback on the 
 kinds of ideas they would like to see proceed.  It was never meant to be a 
 definitive plan for implementing those ideas.  I always envisioned the 
 individual commercial groups picking up on which ideas they liked and wanted 
 to implement & developing their own detailed plans for implementing.

 Attached is a current draft of the Project Why Presentation.   
 
 The first set of slides includes the overview, an explanation that the 
 presentation focueses in on only a few of the ideas, the electronic 
 contracting presentation, the team 2 real time invoice vision, and team 3's 
 auction thoughts.
 
 
 
 Next in the package would be team 3's knowledge call center concept
 
 
 
 Last but not least would be the Team 4 Internet/Intranet concept
