 
 The change order #4 for the compression was Fedexed to Ralph Townsend today.  
 I am holding Change Order #5 the Dew Point Plant until we have the 
 specifications.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 Gerald,
 Where are we with this and the plant doc.  I know we are still working on the 
 plant spec and scope, but I thought we were ready to go with the compressor 
 change order.

 Attached is a draft Change Order for the Electric Drive Compressor Station.   
 Please review. Specifically note the Compressor Contract Price Sheet and how 
 Merrick Modified the Target Price definition.  Also I envision using this 
 same format for the Dew Point Plant Change Order
