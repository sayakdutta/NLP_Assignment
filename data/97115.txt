 Bill,
 
 As mentioned during our conference call this morning, we have significant
 Lend and Park activity with ENA (and some activity with Enron Energy
 Services).  Potential stressed net exposure peaks at $ 12.4 million in April
 ' 02.
 
 Due to the recent downgrades of Enron Corp.'s (Guarantor of ENA's
 obligations to PG&E) senior unsecured debt rating to BBB- by S&P and other
 rating agencies, we respectfully request that Enron North America provide
 PG&E with a Standby Irrevocable Letter of Credit in the amount of $ 6.5
 million expiring no earlier than October 30, 2002.  This request is made
 under the provisions of PG&E's Gas Rule 25 (Gas Services-Customer
 Creditworthiness and Payment Terms).
 
 I would appreciate your letting me know when the L/C will be issued.  Thanks
