 As you know, the Enron Law Conference will be in New Orleans May 5-7.  I will 
 be helping Shonnie Daniel of ECT Legal and Vickie Wolk-Laniewski and Laurie 
 Hamlin of PGE Legal to obtain CLE certification from your respective state 
 bar associations.  This certification will enable you to obtain CLE credit 
 for attending the conference.
 
 We will be applying to the state bars of Texas and Oregon for certification.  
 Please send me a return email message by Tuesday, March 16, 1999, if you 
 desire  certification for any other state.
 
 Thank you,
 Mary C. Ogden
 Legal Specialist
