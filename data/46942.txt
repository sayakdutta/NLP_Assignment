 We are planning a Financial Training meeting next Tuesday at lunch.  This is 
 the first part of our training sessions on the Financial business. The 
 training will be facilitated by Brent Hendry.    I wanted to see if there are 
 any employees in your groups that would benefit from this training.  If so, 
 please let me know how many people will attend by tomorrow afternoon (Friday) 
 so that we can plan for proper seating as well as lunch.  Thanks!
