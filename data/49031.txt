 
 Christie,
 
 Thanks for taking initiative on the trip so quickly. Let's meet with Jeff 
 Shankman
 to discuss the agenda. I shall try to organize a meeting next week after PRCs
 are over.
 
 I agree with your assessment of the group. I was greatly impressed with the 
 caliber of the students.

 Hi evryone!
 
 Vince, Vasant and I are very excited about the Tiger Project!  We all 
 thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to meet with such an incredibly 
 interesting, enthusiastic and intelligent group.  Thank you for your time!
 
 For those interested in the Houston trip on January 18-19th, please let me 
 know by the 15th of December so that I can get the best deal on air fare 
 (one-month in advance).
 
 Also, I'll be forwarding the Enron information packages to Donna Piazze for 
 your receipt next week.  I am including Jeff Shankman in this reply, as Jeff 
 is a Wharton grad, leader of one of our Enron business units, and one of the 
 most enthusiastic Enron/Wharton cheerleaders.  
 
 Please feel free to individually contact me if there is anything I can do for 
 any of you.
 
 Thanks again for your enthusiastic interest in Enron!
 
 --Christie.
