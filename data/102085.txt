 
 Lia Hernandez, currently of ET&S, has accepted a position at ENA effective 
 August 2, 2000.  To ensure that ET&S continues to be in compliance with the 
 marketing affiliate rules, Lia's access to any ET&S or GPG-related LANs or 
 applications should be removed at the close of business on August 1.  In 
 addition, Lia's email profile should be changed and any GPG or ET&S mass 
 distribution  lists should be changed.  
 
 Please send a reply email to me after these changes have been completed, 
 verifying and indicating the date that employee was:
 - removed from the LAN
 - EBB password was changed/canceled (if applicable)
 - removed from ET&S or GPG-related applications
 - email post office box was transfered.
 
 If you have questions, or if you believe there is someone else I need to 
 contact in order to accomplish the above, please let me know.
