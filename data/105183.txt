 
 The agreement must be executed by a VP or higher level.  Do you want us to 
 have Jeff Shankman execute?  SS

 In case any of you have tried to contact Sara, she is not in the office today 
 (her voice mail message states this).  She has laryngitis.  Her doctor has 
 asked her not to talk at all.  She is planning to be in the office tomorrow.  
 If possible, could you try to commuicate through email as much as possible.  
 She can hardly whisper and I promise you will feel really, really guilty if 
 you ask her to talk.
 
 I'll be happy to deliver any messages to her.  My extension is 3-5968.
