 
 Rob,
 
 I have researched your question regarding a confirm from ENA for the April 
 2000 delivery of 5000 MMbu at 2.77.  This transaction was papered under ENA's 
 General Terms and Conditions.   A conformation was sent to Arizona Public 
 Service on 3/29.
 
 I hope this clears up any confusion.  If I can be of further assistance, 
 please do not hesitate to contact me.
 
 Regards,
