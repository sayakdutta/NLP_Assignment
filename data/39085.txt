 Dear Mark,
 
 We, at IBJ, started working on developing Japanese language confirms of
 weather- and energy derivatives. We would like to make them as identical
 to the standard document adopted by the market makers like yourselves as
 possible.
 
 I would appreciate if you could bring some of your standard form
 confirms with you to London, although most of them would look exotic
 enough to our traders.
 
 Thank you in advance and see you next week.
 
 Regards
 
 Terry
