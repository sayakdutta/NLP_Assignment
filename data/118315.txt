 
 I've put an hour on my calendar tomorrow afternoon to discuss conference 
 issues.
 
 
 
 
 Taffy Milligan

 Please advise at your earliest convenience on the below items.
 
 I also need to go over the Master Billing Authorization form with you.  I 
 will need to fax a completed form to the Conference Center, Tuesday, 9/28.
 
 Recreation
 
 The following recreational items are available for the conference attendees.  
 Do you want to offer?  If so, what type of limitations:
  (TPC Golf $106 per person (includes cart fee) plus box lunch ($5-6.00))



  Spa - See Taffy for menu of treatments - 3 treatments for a 10% discount??
 
 Barbara suggested that we recruit Bob Walker to organize the golf outing.  Do 
 you have any objection?
 
 Business Center
 
 I would suggest that we rent at least two additional faxes to accomodate our 
 75+ attendees, since there is only one fax machine in the business center.  
 The rate is $60 per additional line, plus rental of the fax machine.  Do you 
 have any objection.
