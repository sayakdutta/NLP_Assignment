 Cheryl,
 
 Thanks for taking care of these so quickly.
 
 I have reattached the central book request with some additional books.  The blue highlighted "Cent" books were on the original request but were labeled as "FB" and should have been PB as the book name.  I assume you did nothing with those books because there was no id next to it.  Is that correct?
 I corrected them and also added two new books at the bottom.
 
 Thanks again,
 
 Kam

 Cheryl,
 
 The risk management group will be taking over the duties from the controls group as far as setting up new books.  I have attached five book requests that need to be set up for Netco.  Once these are set up can you please call me so I can tell Cecilia.  I will also need the Global ID # to give to EOL for their needs.
 
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kam
