 
 Carolyn,
 
 I believe the commercial operations terminology is appropriate, not 
 takeover.  Please verify with the LV CoGen documents which I forwarded just a 
 few moments ago. The changes I made to the definitions in the prototype 
 letter were a result of the fact that the Blue Dog contract with GE uses 
 slightly different terminology than the LM 6000 contracts.  We need to revert 
 to the appropriate underlying contract.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
