 season.
 
 We are planning on spending Saturday night.  Neil and I will stay at the B & 
 B.
 
 Enjoy this great weather.  I hear more rain is forecast for the weekend - 
 hope they are wrong!
 
 Love,
 
 Kay
 
 
 
 

   
  
 I forgot to tell you Paul was in a wreck Saturday afternoon late. He is
 O.K. except for a broken arm. He was with the Mayor of Palacios and his
 grandson. They were on the way to the high school and someone pulled out
 intothem. Mother
