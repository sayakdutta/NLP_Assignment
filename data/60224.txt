 
 The only contracts out before a bidder is awarded are the PA and ETA.  Essentially the set up agreements for online trading.  The PA is one page and the ETA several.  These are standard and not long.
 
 Let's discuss tomorrow.
 
  
     
 Thanks. Will talk with you tomorrow. One issue that should be discussed is
 the timeline that you sent to scott flood earlier today. My guess is that
 any bidder will have their own minimum master and contract wording that they
 will want to use as well as credit department needs. And so sending out
 language to counterparties before a bidder is awarded should be carefully
 thought out because it may not be acceptable to the bidder. This is only a
 timing issue I think but is important nonetheless.
