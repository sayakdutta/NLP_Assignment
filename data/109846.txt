 
 Dear John,
 
 Jeff Skilling is out of the country until March 5, 2001, and will likely be 
 able to review before his return.  Is this something that can wait?  Please 
 advise.  Thanks, SRS
 
 
 
 


  
  
 
 Jennifer/Jeff:
 
 Enclosed is a proposed term sheet and capitalization table for the proposed
 financing.  Jennifer, before it is circulated further we should give Jeff a
 brief opportunity to review.
 
 If you have any questions please call at 713-690-4848.
 
 Regards,
 
 John Blaisdell
