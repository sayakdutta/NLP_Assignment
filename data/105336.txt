 
 Earlier this year, I negotiated this agreement with GS&C.  I cannot locate 
 the agreement so GS&C is sending a copy.  The Enron party is ENA.  We now 
 need to amend the authorized trader list which I will email to you.  ENA's 
 use of GS&C's platform is for trading US treasuries, agencies, money market, 
 corporates, JGB's.  We need to:
 
 (1)  remove Harry Arora (who was the sole authorized trader)
 
 (2)  add the following:       Darren Delage
    Shane Dallmann
    Ellen Su
    Pushkar Shahi
    Gary Hickerson
 
 THIS IS A VERY HIGH PRIORITY FOR GARY AND WE SHOULD TRY TO COMPLETE TODAY.
