 Sara,
 
 With respect to the amendment to the B of A ISDA Credit Support Annexe, the 
 contact at B of A is James Allred (MD Energy Finance Group & Credit 
 Products). He will pass the docs onto the relevant lawyer.
 
 Tel: 713 651 4830
 Fax: 713 651 4841

 
 As you suggested, I have spoken with Tanya re. the Credit Support Annexe, & 
 she will be sending you a worksheet. 
 
 I have left messages with Teresa re. Mahonia docs. I would be grateful if you 
 would speak with her so that we have consistency in the Chase & Mahonia 
 contracts.
 
 Please give me a call if you need anything else. 
 
 Many thanks, 
 
 Soma
