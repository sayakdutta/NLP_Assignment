 Hi Tana,
 
 I know that you are expecting to get back to me next Wednesday but our
 traders faced credit issues with Enron today and they asked me to push
 forward the process of getting all agreements in place as soon as. Thus, I
 am sending you a draft of a restated and amended guaranty agreement hoping
 that this will help to speed up the process. I will call you on Monday.
