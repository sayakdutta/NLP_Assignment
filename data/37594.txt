 Thanks. I want to let you know that ENA's price is now $.1148 higher than 
 what Agave invoiced for 08/00. I have paid at the invoiced price, since it is 
 less. The difference in the price is in the value for Crude Merc. Your 
 spreadsheet has $31.138 and they show $29.965.

 Genaro,
 
 The Sitara was not updated for Aug.  I just corrected Sitara.  So you can 
 redraft in Unify.  I attached the completed calc-sheet.  Sorry for the delay.

 Darron,
 
  Do you put together a spreadsheet calculating the price for gas purchases 
 from Agave on NNG at the Hobbs Plant? If so, can you forward a copy to me? 
 For 08/00 production, there is a $.56 difference from what is in Sitara and 
 what the customer invoiced us.
 
 Thanks,
 Genaro
