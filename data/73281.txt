 
 Taking asset management to a new level of pain.
 
 Commericial vision is to form a joint venture with NRG to manage a portfolio 
 of generation assets.  I'm meeting with Janelle et al at 10:00 to discuss 
 what we want to do.

 Attached is a rough outline of the information that we might want to 
 incorporate into a LOI with NRG.  We can discuss this at the 10 AM meeting.
 
 Thanks-
