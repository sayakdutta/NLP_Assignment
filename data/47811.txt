 
 Mark, when you send out documents can you put the counterparty's name in the 
 subject line so when I'm looking for the documents I can find them easier.  
 Much thanks.

 Mr. Goldsmith -
 
 At the request of Bob Shults and consistent with your e-mail to Bob, attached 
 are the documents for the BrokerClient products - the BETA and Fee Agreement.
 
 If you should need anything further, please let either me or Bob know.
