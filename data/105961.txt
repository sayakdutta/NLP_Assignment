 I think the draft is fine, although I see no reason to attach the side 
 letters.  Kate should be the recipient of signature pages

 attach the form of each side letter to the agreement for clarity.

 minor comments to LOC Facility that have been faxed to ABN Amro.  We expect 
 that ABN Amro will execute the LOC shortly as soon as they pick up the fax.

 various contracts, we shoudl be prepaerd to exchange signature pages upon 
 conclusion of the LOC Facility.  Lauren will send the LOC together with the 
 Side Letters to Enron and Kate.

 her.  Locke, should signature pages be sent to you as well as to Kate?

 correspondence be directed?
