 Lee Clarke... Sounds like a fag. Garrison woods that is the place my mom was talking about. Do you live near there?
 
   [Dorland, Chris]  
     
 Nice brownstones in garrison woods, the remodeled area of altadore, that
 area offers lots of options from apartment condo's to houses to townhouses
 etc. Kerri? Haven't seen here for a while, hear she is pretty serious with a
 guy named Lee Clarke....
 
 
 
 
 
     
 
 I really want to live in Altadore. I hear that is where all the fly bitches
 hang. I don't know to be honest Killarney / Altadore / West Hillhurst ?
 Close to downtown. I am thinking infill / townhouse. My mom has a friend
 who says there are nice brownstone townhomes in Altadore. I am thinking of
 checking those out. I am looking for minimal maintenance. Do you have any
 ideas? Seen Kerri Murray lately?

    Actually lots. Keep this on the QT for now but this kid is moving back
    to
    cow town. I'll be in town next week shopping for somewhere to live. Just
    in
    time for ski season.
