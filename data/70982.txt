 care of it.

 Can you please fax Karla Hesketh at ABB a copy of the signed change order?  I 
 have a copy of the change order with Mike Sandridge's signature on it, but 
 I'm not sure which signature page we're using as the final official document 
 and therefore which version I should fax to Karla.
 
 Thanks,
 Rebecca

 Hi  Rebecca,
 
 By any chance did Ben leave a copy of the signed contract change order with 
 you?
 If so could you fax a copy to me at 713-821-3526.
 
 Thank you,
 Karla
