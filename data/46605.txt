 Enron North America Corp. dated 11/10/99 appointing Dale Neuner and Robert 
 Shults as agents and attorneys-in-fact to execute Password Applications on 
 behalf of the Company  for online trading.  The original Consent will be sent 
 to Kate Cole for inclusion in the corporate minute book and copies will be 
 sent to Dale and Bob.
 
 When signing the Password Applications, Dale and Bob should sign them as
