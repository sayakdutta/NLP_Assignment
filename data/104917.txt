 
 As you now know, I did not fly to BA from Sao Paulo.  Please let me know if 
 you would like to set up a conference call (from Houston) or wait for me to 
 return to Sao Paulo.  Sara
 
 

  
 
 
 
 
 I heard either you or Susan Bailey are coming tomorrow to BA. It would be 
 great if we could get some time together and go over the MSAs so you can 
 explain to John and I how this transaction works.
 
 Let me know if you will be available some time tomorrow.
 
 Regards,
 
 Rolo
