 Are you available?  If not give us 10 minutes this morning to discuss.
 
 We think the best option is to balance the month with a sale/purchase at $R0 price and push the income and cash payment/receipt into the future.  Remi is giving us a Dec 2002 expected settlement date which is discounted at about 25%.
 
 Other than Lavo's approval does there have to been sound rationale for a Schedule C for AA?

 Please plan to attend a meeting in my office (ECno 2328) at 1:45 today.
 

 
 Martha, I think this will link back to our discussion last week and the decision to "schedule C" some amount for the liquidity issue.
 
 Thanks,
 Jody
