 OK, 
 I'm going to send to each of the schedulers the EPE procedure. Services is not part of UBS's horizons so my status is unknown. EPE needs have thier schedule completed. I'll do it if I'm still here. I plan on doing it Friday. We'll see next week.

 Les, I am still not back from medical leave, please communicate with all 3 schedulers whenever you plan to be out.
 
 
 
  
     
 I'll be out tomorrow. Could you please have one of the schedulers fill in the tag numbers. 
 
 Les
