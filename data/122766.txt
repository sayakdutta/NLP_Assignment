 I figured you were exhausted so I didn't call - I hope Melissa and Hunter are
 better.  I have updated your address and they made me update my pin number - 
 it
 is 68966896 - they now have to be 6-8 digits.  I got my new subscription today
 - it is really neat - thank you.  Also, for tax purposes am I right in 
 thinking
 that I will only have to claim $2,000 as earned income since that is all we
 moved - the year before it was much more and I had to pay taxes.  Let me know.
 Love, Margaret
