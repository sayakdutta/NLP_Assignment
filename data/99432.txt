 
 If we go to Las Vegas for Thanksgiving, we probably can't meet you. Julie is waivering on Las Vegas though. I'll call.
 
  
     
 Very sad.
 
 Hey, yall really need a break from Houston.  Any chance you want to meet us
 at the Perd next weekend.  I would do all the grocery shopping.....to make it
 easy for you and Julie to get the kids out of town.  We have not seen you
 forever....and I have not been to the Perd since July.
 
 I transferred the bunk beds out there, but they still need to be put together
 and in a room.
 
 It would be the 16 and 17
