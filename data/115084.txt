 
 I just want to clarify something, because we were here until about 9 p.m. 
 last night trying to flatten our position, and just figured out this morning 
 that we were off due to the Williams deal that I changed yesterday evening. 
 Apparently Jeff Richter didn't do any deals with Williams for 50 MW through 
 APB, but he did do one for 50 MW with Prebon. So I'm wondering why APB was 
 checking out like this? If possible, I'd like to avoid this in the future. 
 Let me know if you can find anything out from APB.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate

 the williams deals with apb at 215.00, should total 150 mw.  we are just 
 missing 25 mw.
