     the team and encouraged them to do so.  I will talke with Diana to get some feedback from her without
     her having to fill out additional forms if that sounds OK with you.  Thanks. Lynn
 
 
     
 
 Lynn, I have no problem with Shirley, however, since she has began working from home, I have had limited interaction with her due to our work schedules.  She mostly works with the late person (Jean) and the early person (Jerry).  Therefore, if it is at all possible to choose someone else from the team that I work with more closely, I would appreciate it.  Thanks.
  
 Randy

         Randy, I had to change one of your reviewers from Diana Porter to Shirley Walden.  Please 
         let me know if you have any concerns.  Thanks. Lynn
