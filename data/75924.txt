 Kay:
  
 Per the prior e-mail, I am forwarding the InterGen draft of an ENA
 incumbency certificate for your reference.  (Ben also received it directly

 Citibank has advised me that we need Enron to provide an incumbency
 certificate.  I've attached a blank one for you to fill in the appropriate
 people.  They need this as soon as possible.  They also need us to insert
 wiring instructions into each of the Escrow agreements - I am in the process
 of inserting our instructions - please provide your wiring instructions as
 soon as possible.
