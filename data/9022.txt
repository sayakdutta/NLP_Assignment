 
 I didn't have this on my calendar, Lexi, because I wasn't on the list for 
 this event that you handed out regarding the recruiting strategy.  My husband 
 has a commitment away from home for Wednesday night, and with the children in 
 school already, I can't really ask the older kids to babysit for the two 
 year-old during prime homework hours.  Patti has some names that I have 
 suggested for this event and she plans to call you with those names.  Very 
 few of the names on your e:mail message were on the Recruiting Strategy 
 Schedule that you handed out, so I would be surprised if any of these folks 
 have this on their calendars.  You may need some of the names that Patti has 
 for you.  
 I have put the other dates on my calendar, however, and I am in the process 
 of lining those up with our home schedule to make sure that these will work 
 for me.

 Dear UT Recruiting Team Members:
 
 As most of you should know, we are scheduled to participate in the MPA Dinner 
 Cruise on Lake Austin Wednesday, August 23 at 6:30pm.  We are co-sponsoring 
 this event with KPMG, so our presence is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT!!!
 
 Rick Causey will be unable to attend as he has been chosen for jury duty!!! I 
 have also had a few participants notify me that they will be unable to attend.
 
 With this in mind, I am hoping that you will make yourself available to 
 participate in this event.  
 
 Please respond via e-mail or give me a call (3-4585) and let me know if you 
 will be able to represent Enron at this event.  I will then give you the 
 logistics for the event.  It is scheduled to begin at 6:30, so we are 
 expected to arrive between 6:00 and 6:15.
 
 Please let me know ASAP if you will be able to help.
 
 Thank you!
