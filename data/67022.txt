 Please plan to attend our next meeting on Order 637, Imbalance Provisions, on Wednesday, October 31, 2001 at 9:00 AM in conference rooms 1336 (Houston) and 724 (Omaha).   We want to review our list of "Keeps" and "Trades" and also discuss our next steps.  If you need a copy of Lindy's Sept 20th memo with the list, let me know.  gh
