 Following please find our Corporate Lawyers comments to the changes you
 requested to the Guaranty we are working on:
 
 1.	Recitals.  We do not see why it would be necessary to add that
 "The Guarantor will directly or indirectly benefit from the
 Transactions between the Beneficiary and PMI".  Please explain. [Heard, Marie]    Because (i) it is a correct statement and (ii) it clarifies the element of consideration which is essential for purposes of enforceability. 
 
 2.	Section 1.  Considering that Pemex normally needs 5 business
 days to request funds in foreing currencies to the Central Bank, we
 need to change the payment date to be 5 Business Days after receipt of
 the Payment Demand instead of 3 days. [Heard, Marie]    We are okay with this change. 
 
 3.	Section 6. Jurisdiction.  We think that New York Jurisdiction is
 a good option and probably the most experienced in terms of derivatives
 trading, and therefore we prefer to keep the "exclusive" jurisdiction
 of any federal court sitting in the Borough of Manhattan. [Heard, Marie]    We are okay with the "exclusive" jurisdiction. 
 
 The rest of your comments are acceptable to us.  Carlos Riveroll will
 be sending you PMI?s comments to the amendment to the MSA, so we can
 finalize this as soon as posible.
 
 Best regards,
 
 Martha Navarro
