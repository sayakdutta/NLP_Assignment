 Jeff:
 
 As you know, last Tuesday I left message for Harald Jensen in EES to follow-up to his request.  I have not heard back from him. Shall I contact him again or just wait for him to get back to us?

 Greetings Ms J:
 
 Could you do me a favor and call harold jenson (sp?) in EES and see what he's looking for?  He's apparently looking for deregulation info about CA.  Greatly indebted, as always.
 
 Unfortunately, I'm not likely to get to the CERA conference.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
