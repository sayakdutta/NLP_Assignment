  We received approval from Lavorato to do this transaction. Please check the  
 attached confirm. I have removed the language which required COO approval and 
 also changed the option premium to $150,000 from $140,000.  Also Pride signed 
 the ISDA and faxed over the signature page. How do we or can we  assign a 
 date to the ISDA for the confirm?
 Thanks for you help!
