 Thanks John.....
 
 
     
 
 being done as I write this
 
     
                 
    734 and we're done
 
    
                 
 
    we have already done the aug 03, how many may 02 do you want us to do?
 
        
                             
       John
 
       The simplest thing would be to disregard the 926 Aug'03 instructions
    and
       to
       do the 1660 May 02 only....
 
       Your call

       The answer would be yes if it were the only ex-pit instructions we
       received
       today.
 
       Given that you have instructed us already to ex-pit the 926 August 03
       position, we would only want you to transfer 734 of the May 02
    futures.
 
       If you only do the 1660 May 02 or, if you do the 926 august 03 and
    734
       May
       02 then YES, we will wire the money immediately after one or other of
       those
       expits are achieved.

       Will you wire the money immediately when this is done?

          Dear John
 
          In place of the original transfer of options that we sent you
       yesterday,
          I
          propose the following transfer instead. You will note that it
       includes
          no
          options at all.
 
          short 1660 May 2002 futures
 
          Please understand that this entire affair is making me as
       uncomfortable
          as
          it is clearly making you.
 
          Kind regards
          Kevin R Davis
