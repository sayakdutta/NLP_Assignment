 Hello, attached below is an example of a monthly option and a daily option.  
 The only difference being one is exercised once a month and the other is 
 exercised daily.  The times that options are exercised varies by delivery 
 point and whether the option is daily or monthly.  We can send you a list of 
 these rules if needed.
 
 
 
 Let me know if you need anything else.
 
 Thanks,
 Melissa
