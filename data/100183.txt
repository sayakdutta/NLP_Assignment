 A triple B is actually better than a triple A
 What do you think?
 
  
     
 i'm not so sure that i will put anymore into ENE.....just depends on how low it goes!
 
 We go to Dallas this weekend.
 We may have a couple hour layover in Houston on Sunday evening so may have to have you come visit after the baseball party.
 
 I'm making an except by responding to your e-mail.......it is usually my policy not to respond to such things!!! hahahaha

 The sky is falling! The sky is falling! 
 Oh, never mind that's just Enron stock price!
 It is probably crazy but I'm buying some more here!
 Good thing that with Equity that you can not lose more than your investment!
 
 Josh lost his last baseball game last night 6-11.
 It was not so much they got beat as they gave it away.
 They were ahead by 2 going into the last inning and had 9 runs score on 11 errors.
 I think we figured the other team had something like 9 outs that inning.
 
 Josh and I are going to LSU this weekend.
 Jarrod is staying with Joan since he has an end of season baseball party on Sunday.
 The party is at 2:00 and we are scheduled to get into Hobby at 1:10 so I hope to make it to the party.
 
 Be Safe and may the FORCE be with you!
