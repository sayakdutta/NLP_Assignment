 You e-mail worked perfectly.  I was going into the board meeting when it was 
 received, so sorry I didn't respond.  Your Dad hasn't seen your message yet, 
 but hopefully he can call this afternoon.  I hope that works for you.  He is 
 leaving early this afternoon as he and Linda have an appointment at 4:30.

 Dad,
 I need to talk to you about the contract I am drafting
 and wanted to know a good time to call. Can you please
 let me know when we can schedule a call. It should
 only take about 15 minutes.
 Thanks
 Elizabeth
