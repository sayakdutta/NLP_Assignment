 I spoke with Clem and he is preparing the amendment for immediate execution 
 as the signers will be at an offsite tomorrow.  I'll let Tom know as soon as 
 the amendment has been executed.  Anna Meytina is on vacation so I left a 
 message with Sharon Chernick.
 
 In order to complete our files with respect to the Enron North America Inc. 
 ("ENA") Securities Loan Agreement, please provide me with copies of the 
 following documents:
 
 (1)  assignment of the Securities Loan Agreement from ENA to ECI (or was a 
 separate agreement with ECI executed?)
 
 (2) termination of the prior Enron Corp. guaranty on behalf of ENA in the 
 amount of  USD25 Million 
 
 I spoke with Stephanie and she could not locate your Bear/ECI files on Friday 
 of last week.  
 
 Thanks.
