 	To further respond to questions about the ENA imbalance as we reported in the accounts meeting on Thursday, the Receipt Point imbalance of 9,896 was the result of measurement PPA's for Nov. 01,  Oct. 01, and Aug. 01 at Matagorda 665 and Northwest Frisco on ENA's pooling agreement k5166. 
            The No Notice imbalance of 1,616 that was recorded as ENA's imbalance should have been on Pratt and Whitney's own DPOA contract, but was not because the old system and the new system needed to be synchronized.  Most of this imbalance was traded with FGU (they forgot about the 40 mmbtus of fuel) leaving only a small amount on ENA.  This situation has now been repaired so it will not be a problem prospectively.  Starting February,  the Pratt and Whitney point in on FGU's DPOA.
