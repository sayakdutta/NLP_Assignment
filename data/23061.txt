 
 Bob, congratulations on this matter and on the Baltimore matter.  In light of your admirable batting average, we may need to reinsert you in the CATS Litigation! All the best.  Jim

 We settled this case at mediation yesterday for a $125,000 payment by Omnicomp and a $125,000 payment by Steve Heinz.  The reason we settled is that we had some exposure (the two mock juries both came back in favor of Linton, awarding an average of $1 million in damages), and the estimated cost of litigation through trial and appeal was $150,000-$175,000.  Our counsel, Tom Allen of Reed Smith, did an excellent job with the case, and I would recommend using him again.  Please call me with any questions.
