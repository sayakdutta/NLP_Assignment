 
 I have to leave the office now.  I will call you around 11:00 and we can meet somewhere. OK.
 
  
     
 Well, nothing in life is ever free. It will cost you!!!!!!!
 
  
     
 I think it is stronger than that, however, we have never experienced anything like that and I was a little unsure of how you would react. Are you free for lunch?
 
 
 
  
     
 Of course I do! Just because you are upset with me or see things differently doesn't make me not love you all of a sudden. Hopefully, our relationship is stronger than that.
 
  
     
 I still love you.  I am not sure if you still love me?  I was a little confused after our conversation yesterday.
 
  
     
 Missing you. Are you OK? Do you still love me?
