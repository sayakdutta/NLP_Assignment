 already fully booked.  Will you be in San Antonia later?  Maybe we can meet 
 then.

 I will be in Houston Wednesday morning and would like to see if I could get 
 on your schedules for 45 minutes to discuss current Argentina issues. I will 
 ask my assistant Maria Jose Minguillion to contact each of you to see if this 
 is convenient
 
 Joe maybe we could have an early coffee of late evening discussion.
 
 
 Thanks
