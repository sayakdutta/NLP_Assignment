 
 did i mention that rental fees to use the truck are $67/day?
 
 that aside, our net account is now:
 
 Nancy owes Jeff for Abalone ($67/entree) =  $149,756.39
 Jeff owes Nancy for parking fees ($67/day) =         $189.00
 Nancy owes Jeff     $149,567.39
 
 
 Also, thanks a million for the delicious dinner, the very competitive game of 
 spades, letting me do my laundry, and compelling conversation about 
 watery/non-watery tomatoes.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
