 
 Kristin,
 
 Thanks a lot for the resume.
 We shall arrange a phone interview with Richard. This is out standard procedure.
 A phone interview is  followed by the on-site interview, after we determine what is the best team to interview
 the candidate.

 Vince,
 
 Last week I was contacted by one of my friends who is very interested in becoming an Enron employee.  He has a PHD and several years research and lab experience.  
 
 Richard is afraid that being a PHD is a dying breed and may need to go back to school to obtain an MBA.  I was wondering if you would mind looking at the attached resume to assess if you have any interest in Richard, or if you feel I should encourage him to go back to school.  I am unclear as to the qualifications for your group so I apologize if this request is way off base.
 
 Thank you for your help,
