 to your request early next week with an acceptable time.  Thank you.  Sara
 
 
 
 

    
 
 Sara, could we schedule a time to talk about the margin loan agreement and
 the form of guaranty? I can do it anytime tommorrow (Friday) afternoon.
 Kris will not be on the call. I would like to see what points we can
 resolve before we resort to the business people. Thanks.
