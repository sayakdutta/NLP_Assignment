 Mack McLarty and his people would like to get together with you in Los 
 Angeles during the Dem convention to discuss our Southern Cone issues, 
 strategies, etc.  Will you be there on the Monday?

 Steve:
 
 Speaking of LA, I have spoken to Mack's scheduler, Andrea, and it appears
 that he'd be available for this on Monday AM -- don't know how that fits
 into the Enron schedule.  It probably makes the most sense to have her
 coordinate any such meeting.  How would you recommend that we proceed?
 Thanks, Kellie
