 The committee has started working on the first phase of the Technology Plan 
 which is to develop an intranet web page for ENA Legal.  Our department's 
 organizational chart will be provided as well as a description of the area(s) 
 of responsibilities for each group.  Would you be so kind as to provide me 
 with a short paragraph describing your group's responsibilities?  The group 
 is scheduled to meet again on Wednesday, October 25, so if I could have the 
 description of your group's responsibilities as soon as possible it would be 
 greatly appreciated.  
 
 Mark Haedicke is eager to have our intranet web page designed as soon as 
 possible.  Many thanks for your time and attention to this matter.
