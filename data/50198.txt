 Vince,

 Hello.? I hope you are well.
 ?
 Through the course of our work in developing an energy  product, I have 
 learned?the publication Derivatives Week is  preparing a special report on 
 weather and energy derivatives.? They have  asked us if we know of anyone who 
 could contribute to the  editorial.
 ?
 I thought of you.? Would you be amenable to my presenting  your name?
 ?
 Look forward to hearing from you.
 ?
 Regards,
 ?
