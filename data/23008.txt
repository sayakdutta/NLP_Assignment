 I will be sending four copies of PwC Local Deliverables Agreement, initialled by legal, for your signature. 
 
 The  agreement forms part of the Global Outsourcing Contract for compliance services with PwC for European Commercial Finance Sarl.  It details what services we require PwC to perform i.e. tax compliance, statutory accounts preparation.
 
 I'd be grateful if you could sign it and then return to me. 
 
 If you have any questions please contact me on ext 37408. 
 
 Many thanks
