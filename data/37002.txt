It rose at least 3 feet (and it's a big lake!) in a matter of 5 hours.  My boat is on a lift out of the water.  In the morning it was floating.  Their dock is underwater.  I've never seen anything like it.  I hope everyone over there is alright.  Have you seen the newest edition?  We hope to get down your way sometime this summer.  Until then stay dry and take care.
