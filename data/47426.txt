 Tana-
 
 I work in the Tax Department with Mark Ng and I was wondering if you had the 
 information on which entities will be included in the ENA footnote as of 
 12/31/00.  If you are not the right person to contact on this matter, I 
 apologize for taking up your time.  Please let me know the contact on this if 
 possible.
 
 
 Thank you,
