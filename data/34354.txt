 
 Hi gang.  We still need to make some changes to Sea Robin.
 
 I believe we need 2 pricing zones, Mainline Pool and Offshore.  The new Sea 
 Robin curve will be used to value the Offshore zone and we will use CGLF/La 
 curve to value everything else.  Per my discussion with Christine, the 
 following meters should be moved/mapped to the Offshore zone;
 
 Meter
 4743
 4747
 4741
 4754
 4771
 4753
 4794
 4728
 4700
 4749
 4751
 9740
 6335
 6333
 4794
 4700
 4850
 ISRP84
 FSRP3
 2SRP9
 
 
 Please let me know what I need to do or if anyone has any questions.
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
    
 
 Chris,
 
 Here is the thread on the Sea Robin Curve

 I think the best thing to do would be to create a separate zone for all of 
 those ISRP meters.  The traders typically take deals from ISRP to the Pool 
 and incur transport.  Therefore having two zone would more accurately 
 represent what is actually happening.
 
 I am in London helping Brent Price with some audit work that he is doing.

 Well, whenever we map specific meters on a zone to curves that are different 
 than what the entire zone is mapped to, we create an alternative facility 
 mapping for each specific meter that you want mapped differently.  Currently, 
 there are 137 active meters on the Sea Robin Pool zone with a prefix of 
 ISRP.  That would mean I would have to create 137 alternative facility 
 mappings.  Another alternative would be to have all of those meters moved to 
 their own zone and then just create one mapping for that whole zone.  
 However, this will also take a great deal of time, since Global Facilities 
 would have to change the zone on every single facility record.  Plus, we 
 would have to see what type of activity is on all of these meters and we 
 would have to update the zone on all of these deals after Global Facilities 
 made it's change.  So, let me know what your thoughts are.  What are you 
 doing in London???

 Imelda,
 
 I am in London right now, and dont' have access to a phone.  The only part of 
 Sea robin that should be moved are the meters with a prefix of ISRP.  I'm 
 sorry if that wasn't clear.  Please let me know if that will be a problem to 
 fix.

 David, Sea Robin Pool is a zone on the Sea Robin Pipeline (SEAR).  The Sea 
 Robin Pool zone includes many different meters some of which do have a prefix 
 of ISRP.  However, there are also other meters in that zone that have the 
 following prefixes: LSRP, FSRP and PSRP.  I mapped the entire zone to the new 
 curves you sent us.  Given your message it seems like things might not be 
 peachy after all if you only wanted the ISRP meters mapped that way.  Please 
 call me as soon as you get a chance.

 I am not sure if Searobin ISRP is a meter level location or Zone level, but 
 as long as only Sea Robin Pool ISRP locations are mapped to the new curve, 
 then everything will be peachy.

 Dave - they called me on this to see if it was a meter mapping or a zone 
 mapping.  I said zone.....

 Imelda and Karie,
 
 The East desk traders have asked me to set up a new curve for the Sear/Sea 
 Robin Pool/ISRP zone.  The curve is already set up in Erms.  Please do your 
 sitara voodoo to map the above location to this new curve.
