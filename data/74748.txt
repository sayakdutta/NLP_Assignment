 
 Hi Bart,
 
 I think it is an East deal, so I wouldn't think it would be dumped on you.  I 
 just think it is nice to see the good stuff.

 Kay,
 
 Just a thought....Bart Clark used to work in the coal business.  I've worked 
 with Bart before and found him to be an excellent practical attorney and 
 individual.  Would you consider using him?

 Hi John,
 
 I'll be glad to consider using Aaron.  Let me take a look at the agreements 
 first, before we commit.  Did Bob Carter work on these agreements?  He might 
 have copies, and he won't charge us for them.  At least I don't think he will.
 
 Thanks for your understanding and patience this week.
 
 Kay

 I hope everything is going OK.
 
 With Kathleen's help and Jeff Hodge's review the CA went out on Wednesday via 
 email to BPUB.  Mitch and I are reviewing the TEX/MEX agreements to determine 
 an appropriate commercial structure with the intent of preserving as much of 
 the "legalese" in the original agreements (i.e., the development agreement 
 and the participation agreement) as possible.  Our major concern is to keep 
 this off Balance Sheet.  
 
  I'll call B &P to see if they have electronic versions.  Would you consider 
 having Aaron Roffwarg of B & P work on this agreement, he was previously 
 involved in the drafting of the agreements and he knows all of the players 
 and their habits.

 I'm still out of town, but now I have email access.  Did your CA get taken 
 care of?
 
 You mentioned that you feel like we can use Tex-Mex as a go-by.  Do you have 
 electronic copies of the development agreement?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
