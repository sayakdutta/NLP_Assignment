 I'm not working on this project but the forms of agreements are modified from 
 forms I prepared and had reviewed by outside counsel in Mississippi and 
 Alabama for legal sufficiency.    I prepared the basic forms for Steve Walton 
 in March of this year after he had contacted Steve Van Hooser for assistance 
 in drafting real estate documents on the Caledonia project.  Steve Walton 
 then provided them to Robert Shaw to use for acquisition of property in ENA's 
 name.  I haven't heard anything about the project since then.

 This was sent to me by one of the developers.  I believe it relates to an 
 expansion (or new interconnection) of the Caledonia facility.  I don't know 
 which lawyer has been working on it, so I'm sending it around to see if 
 anyone claims it. Chris thought that someone from Power Trading may have been 
 working on it.

 Kay,
 
 This is the format for the land options that Robert Shaw of New Century is 
 using in Caledonia, MS.  Please advise if these documents are appropriate.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Chris
