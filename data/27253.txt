 Mr. Forney,
 
 Thanks or giving me a moment to speak to you today.  I am looking for a
 position at Enron for the near future.  I have been serving as a day ahead
 and hourly trader as well as a scheduler for BTU.  Other tasks have included
 designing automated spreadsheets to assist with trading and settlements and
 various IT work.  I am looking for something high paced, something that will
 keep me busy throughout the day.  I am quick with analytics and have taken
 courses in Calculus, Differential Equations, Statistics, and Econometrics to
 add to my BS in Economics.
 
 I am looking to move to Houston for personal reasons, to be with the girl I
 am planning on marrying next year.  I like it here at BTU, but staying in
 this area is not presently an option.  Please take a look, ask me any
 question you can think of, and feel free to contact me at any time.  I will
 be in Houston Saturday through Wednesday visiting my girlfriend who is a
 consultant for Sun Gard, working at Reliant.
 
 Thank you again,
 
 Brandon Whittle
