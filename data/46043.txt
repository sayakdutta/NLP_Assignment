 
 Can someone talk to Coral so I can get out of the business of assigning 
 "oops" trades...

 These are all Enron Online deals.  Evidently, the Coral traders are logging 
 into EOL incorrectly.  We have one other deal that Joe Hunter emailed you 
 previously.  I am uncertain whether or not the Coral traders can be prevented 
 from logging in as Coral Energy Resources.
 
 
    
  
 Why do we have so many deals from Coral that need to be assigned?

 Tana,
 
 Coral Energy Resources has six more deals from Thursday 11/02/00 that need to 
 be assigned to Coral Energy Holdings.  The deal numbers are as follows:
 
 Q74176.1
 Q74562.1
 Q74565.1
 Q74569.1

 These deals will have a status of "Pending - Sent to Legal" until I hear back 
 from you.
 
 Thank you.
 Kevin
