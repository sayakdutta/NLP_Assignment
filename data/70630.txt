 Attached please find a clean draft of the Enron South America Turbine
 Agreement, as well as a blackline showing changes made to the from
 document agreed to by GE.
 
 The only additional information that we need to insert into the
 agreement is the Agreement Number in Section 6.7.1.
 
 I will send the exhibits in a few moments.
