 GOVERNOR DAVIS ANNOUNCES PRINCIPLES OF AGREEMENT WITH SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
 EDISON
 
 
 
 LOS ANGELES 
 
 Governor Gray Davis today announced an agreement in principle with Southern
 California Edison to keep the utility solvent.
 
 "This is the framework of a good, balanced deal," said Governor Davis. "It's
 not a final deal. There's a lot of work to be done. But we're making
 progress.
 
 "This is a complex transaction with a lot of moving parts. With these terms
 in place, I'm confident we'll be able to hammer out a final agreement
 shortly."
 
 The State has agreed to purchase the utility's transmission lines for an
 estimated $2.76 billion (2.3 times estimated book value) and allow Edison to
 issue bonds for a substantial portion of its undercollection.
 
 In exchange, Southern California Edison has agreed to:
 
 
 *    Make payments from its parent company, Edison International, to the
 utility of approximately $420 million;
 *    Commit the entire output of the parent company's Sunrise Mission power
 project at low "cost-based" rates for 10 years (a value to ratepayers of
 $500 million over the next two years);
 *    Provide cost-based rates from the generating facilities they own for
 another 10 years;
 *    Conservation easements on 20,000 acres of watershed lands for 99 years;
 and
 *    Drop their pending litigation against the Public Utilities Commission
 that would have resulted in immediate higher electric rates for consumers if
 they had prevailed in court.
 
 
 
 Negotiations will continue during the next several days with the utility.
