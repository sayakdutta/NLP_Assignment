 
 I would use this along with the O & M schedules we sent you earlier.  If anyone wants more detail they need to go directly to Stan Horton or Brain Stanely.  Apparantly they have already worked up a plan.
 
 Thanks
 
  
     
 Tracy,
 
 As discussed, the EEOS functions, including NEPCO, previously turned in to Corp are defined as follows:
 
 
 Commercial  -  Includes Engineering, Project Management, Construction Management and Business Development.
 
 Logistics  -  Includes Procurement.
 
 Other Mid-Office  -  Includes Project Controls, Estimating, QA, Contracts and Administration.
 
 Legal  -  Includes Legal.
 
 Accounting/Audit/Finance/Treasury  -  Includes Accounting & Finance
 
 Information Technology  -  Includes IT personnel
 
 Human Resources  -  Includes HR personnel
 
 Executive  -  Includes the Presidents of EEOS & NEPCO and other Nepco Executive staff.
 
 Other  -  Includes Nepco rent and employees for Caxios, Nepco Europe, OEC & EPIC.
 
 
 Do you need these defined further than this? I did not include the obvious functions Enron Property Services or severance.
