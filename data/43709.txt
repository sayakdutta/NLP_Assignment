 
 The question below was forwarded to me by Aquila.  The question (in red) is from PPL.  What would be TW's strategy and can someone get back with PPL?
 
 thanks

 Kevin, thanks for the document we will have it reviewed in the event PPL
 opts to 
 use it to meet any credit requirements.
 
 I do have one question that might have been addressed at the informational 
 sessions.  Based on the open season documents, Red Lake will interconnect
 with 
 both El Paso and TW at a minimum, with other points to be determined based
 on 
 interest. I was wondering if there had been any discussions with either
 pipeline 
 about the impact of adding this interconnection. I know that may be a loaded
 
 questions, but based on historic flows, in order to guarantee firm
 deliveries 
 from that receipt point, a shipper would have to move its primary receipt
 point 
 to the Red Lake interconnection (from say San Juan or East of Thoreau areas
 on 
 TW) or negotiate alternate arrangements with the pipelines. Sorry for the 
 rambling question, but in valuating the asset, the question of
 transportation 
 inevitably comes up. 
 
 Thanks
 David
 
 
     
 
 David,
 
 Here is the form that I promised.  I hope that this helps and sorry for the
 inconvenience.  Please do not hesitate to contact me with any other
 questions. <<Red Lake Gas Storage Agreement.doc>>
