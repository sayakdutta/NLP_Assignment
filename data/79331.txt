 course.  The layout of the front nine was outstanding.  10,11,13 were long 
 and hard.  We shot 6 under and had a great time.  I bought a new odyssey 
 putter and love it.
 
 You guys did a nice job on the course.

 I understand from Battaglia you played Memorial Park the other day. Other 
 than the terrible greens, did you enjoy it?
