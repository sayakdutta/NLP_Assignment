 		Steve Harris and the other Transwestern commercial people are seeking guidance on what limits will be imposed by the new credit facility on Transwestern's dealings with affiliates, most notably EWS/ENA. Will it be necessary to obtain the consent of the lenders before Transwestern may enter into any transaction with an affiliate? Are there de minimis exceptions? Are there any plans to obtain pre-approval of either certain categories of transactions or transactions up to an aggregate dollar limit? Any feedback would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
