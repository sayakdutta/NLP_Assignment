 Thanks for your message. I am doing fine, considering the circumstances.
 What about Wednesday, December 5. I can meet you at your hotel.
 
 My cell phone number, just in case, is 713 410 5396.
 
 Look forward to meeting you.

 Hi Vince:
  
 Hope the Enron crisis hasn't turned you upside down personally...
  
 I'm going to be in Houston next week on a client call, and wondered if  you'd be interested in having breakfast Wednesday or Thursday.  We're  hoping to open an RCM office in Houston, and I wanted to speak to you to see if  you had any ideas on how we might staff it.
  
 Regards,
  
 David
