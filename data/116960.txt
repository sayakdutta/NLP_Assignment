 
 It looks great, Nadine. I entered a couple different deals and played around 
 with them a bit, and I don't see any changes. So from my end you can go ahead 
 and move this version to production.
 
 Thanks for all the hard work.

 Hi Everyone,
 
 There is a new version of Deal Entry (Ver. 2.6.6.58)  in stage that needs to 
 be User Acceptance Tested.
 
 The changes were actually for Australia (wrong date/time showing, problem 
 with EOL) and London (fix to default settings).
 These changes should actually be invisible to Houston so you should see no 
 difference between the way it was working before and now.
 
 Please test the application (as you would normally use it) and let me know 
 (by way of email or phone call) if Deal Entry is working well, and can be 
 migrated to Production.  We are hoping to release it to Prod by this evening, 
 (January 12, 2001).
 
 
 Thanks, 
 Nadine Costanzo (713)853-9863.
