 Attached are the slides that Lorraine Cross plans to use to kick off the Feb. 
 10 meeting with Larcamp.  I have a conference call with Lorraine tomorrow at 
 10 am to discuss the Larcamp meeting.  Let me know if you see anything 
 troubling with the slides.
 
 
 
 
 MK - I thought these statistic might be helpful background for your 
 presentation as well.
