 Jeff,
 
 After speaking with Gayla about the message below,  you were listed as Brad's 
 supervisor.
 
 Eric,
 
 Please call Gayla to set up a time to meet with Fred Kelly regarding Brad 
 Hitch's performance for the Associate and Analyst PRC.
 
 Thanks,
 Shanna

 Should this have come to me?

 I have tried to reach all of you by phone or left a voice mail to schedule an 
 appointment with Fred Kelly before the final PRC on Dec. 13.  He feels it is 
 very important that he meet with you and your supervisor before Dec 13.  
 Please call me at X66157 to schedule a time .  Attached is a "cheat sheet" 
 that Fred would like you to fill out and email or bring to him.
 
 If you have already set up a meeting please disregard this email.
 
 Thank you.
