 raising this to me because she wasn't comfortable with the outcome of her 
 conversations with you two, or did she skip that step?  Just curious, before 
 I send any type of response.  I would need details from you around the 
 process for updates to Entelligence and Global Counterparty.  Surely one 
 feeds the other?  --Sally

 Sally,
 
 I have been made aware of a disconnect between the data held in Global 
 Counterparty and in Global Companies ( Entelligence). Much effort has been 
 put forth in  "cleansing" the parent/subsidiary information presented in 
 Entelligence, yet the same information is not being replicated in GCP except 
 for on an ad hoc, manual basis. 
 
 What is the standard for data population in GCP vs Entelligence? Should 
 changes and corrections in Entelligence not flow to GCP since our risk and 
 trading systems are based on the information housed therein? What process and 
 or systems enhancements are necessary to accomplish this end result?
 
 It appears we have a major GCP cleanup in the works while much of the work 
 has been already been done for Entelligence. As we struggle to report trading 
 positions properly,  let's take advantage of our in house knowledge and share 
 counterparty data validation results in order to minimize research and data 
 population efforts.
 
  Your comments and ideas are welcome. 
 
 Debbie
