 
 I hope you are doing well.  I finally have my laptop so I can at least read 
 email during the day.  The weather here is gorgeous.  It's about 72 during 
 the day and cooler at night.  We went to a restaurant that had a "tunnel of 
 fudge" por d'creme.  Someone at the table said there is a similar recipe in 
 the Charlie Trotter cookbook.  Do you have that cookbook?  I know you have a 
 lot of them.  I fly hime Friday night and arrive in Houston on Saturday 
 morning at 6:30 am.  Mike should be waiting for me at my house and I can't 
 wait to see the Phoebe and sports dog a/k/a Chloe.  How's mother and daddy?  
 I can't send mother email because she may pick it up on her voice mail. Love, 
 sas
 
 PS  Are you working on Friday?
