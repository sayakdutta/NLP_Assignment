 
 Attached is the Annex B to be used for all future financial transactions with the referenced counterparty.  Please let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
 
 Will the person who will be working on this please let me know so that I can fax a copy of the guaranty to be attached to Annex B?
 
 Thanks!
 
 Marie
