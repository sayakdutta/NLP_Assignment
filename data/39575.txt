 Mark, on reflection, I think that there is currently only one legal risk 
 within Enron Canada that would warrant being added to the top legal risks for 
 ENA, which is the Alberta Sundance "B" PPA acquired in the Alberta PPA 
 auction in August, 2000.
 
 I would suggest the description attached.

 Peter
