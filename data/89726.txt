In terms of pushing the timing, political clout is going to be more important which in the past would have come from Kean and Lay.   Obviously, that will not work anymore.   I have a good relationship with Larcamp (FERC head of Staff) and might be able to help with the politics.   I think FERC is going to want to hear directly from  the new owner.   If we want speed, I recommend we use the expertise of Christi and Sarah combined with the overall political clout of the new owner.
 
 You are not off base with Steffes at all.
 
  
     
 I've never been a big fan of Shapiro, however, I wonder if he could help with the speed of the regulatory process.  Steffes seems to talk more than act.  Am I way off base.
 
 My issues with Rick have never been related to competence but were based on costs of his unit.
