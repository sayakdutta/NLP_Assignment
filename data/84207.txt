 Gerald --   To address your concerns raised in the proposed rider to 
 Paragraph 11.2, we would suggest the following language be inserted as the 
 last paragraph in Article XI:
 
 11. __  Shipper retains its rights to raise objections of undue 
 discrimination with regard to rates and/or terms and conditions applicable to 
 Phase V service on grounds of undue discrimination; provided however, in the 
 event Shipper has such objections, Shipper will provide Transporter with ten 
 (10) days written notice prior to filing any such objections with FERC.
