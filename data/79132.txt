    I'm a bit unclear as to the source of the information contained in the first two sentences of paragraph 2.  I think that they should more accurately be worded, "TW benefits from contractual commitments for its firm transportation contracts into California, contracts covering 86% of TW's capacity to California continue through 2005.  Long term risk is mitigated by contracts covering 40% of TW's capacity post 2005, and a settlement agreement with current firm customers."  This would reflect our position inclusive of Red Rock.
    I'm not sure where their numbers on expiring contracts came from, but I wouldn't have a problem documenting these.
