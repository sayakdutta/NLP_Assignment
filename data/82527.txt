 How are you?  Thank you so much for your concern regarding my son.  He broke his elbow on Sunday afternoon while playing on the monkey bars.  It was quite scary, but his spirits are high again and he seems to be making the adjustment.  
 
 It means alot to me to get messages from you regarding my family's well-being.
 
 Thanks again for your genuine concern!!!!  You're the best!
 
  
     
 I understand your little boy had an accident.  I hope things are ok, family is always first - please take time off to make sure he's ok.
 
 Louise
