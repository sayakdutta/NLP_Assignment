 Here's where I am on the ILA.  I think it should be distributed internally 
 and to the Cities ASAP,  with an explanation that we are still pondering it.

 PS.  I didn't redline because there were formatting challenges I couldn't

 Kay,  I think they will have the following questions:
 
 
 3.  Liquidated Damages - does this still allow "unit contingent" power 
 deals?  That is all we will be buying from them.
 5.  Events of Default and Remedies - Is this OK with Mississippi law??
 6.  Billing and Payment Netting - I don't think the terms will work.  Their 
 boards meets the second and fourth Tuesday of each month.  Payment cannot be 
 authorized until the board approves.
 10.  Miscellaneous - the arbitration language is the Houston venue....
 
 
 I just got your email, so I will send it anyway.
