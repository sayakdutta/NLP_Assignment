 
 Hi Ginger:
 
 Rick and I spoke and decided that it would be a good idea to provide UC 
 Berkeley's Graduate School of Public Policy with a small stipend of $2,500 to 
 help underwrite a conference they're sponsoring with the business school on 
 Monday.  I'll be participating in the conference.
 
 Could you please make the check payable to (the faceless)  "UC Regents" and 
 send it to:
 
 Heather Cameron
 Richard and Rhoda Goldman School of Public Policy
 University of California
 2607 Hearst Avenue
 Berkeley, CA  94720
 
 
 The school's Federal Taxpayer ID is:  946002123.
 
 Thanks very much.  If you have any questions, don't hesitate.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
