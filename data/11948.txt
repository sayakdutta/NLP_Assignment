 
 Michael, I will be discussing with John and others in the near future about 
 the status of the study.  When will your progress report be ready for 
 review?  It might be a good idea to let us review your report and then we can 
 make comments and recommendations based upon your findings.  Im glad that 
 things are going well with your data and that we may be able to apply 
 something positive towards our situation.  Thanks for getting back with me.
 
 
 
 







 
  
 
 Hi Larry:
  Sorry for the delayed response. I have just got back from an
 overseas trip yesterday. I am in the process of preparing a progress report
 for you. We have obtained some additional interesting results. I was also
 waiting for input from your group. You may recall that at the end of our
 Houston meeting, John told me that he would be getting back to me on some
 specific directions from the group. I believe that we would be done with the
 major aspects of PCB work soon, then we would be focusing on arsenic. Please
 let me know of any thoughts and ideas. Thanks Larry.
   We are finally seeing the Spring here and maybe a short one for that
 matter. Summer is just around the corner.
 Best Regards,
 Michael
 
 
 



  
 
 Michael, I know its been some time since we communicated, but how is the
 PCB pipeline modeling efforts going?   I would appreciate a  summary from
 you identifying  recent discoveries and a general update on the project.
 
 Have you thawed out from the Pennsylvania winter?
