I don't recall that it gave the Senate advise and consent rights, but sure would be interesting if it does.  Thanks.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
 
  
     
 IEP reported on its Leg call today that Burton told Davis -- don't even think about trying to replace Loretta as the President of the CPUC because she is the only President he will support (the Senate has to approve the appointment, apparently)
