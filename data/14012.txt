I don't want there to be any other surprises, so I'd like to include "known and unknown" type language here.  Also, does the definition of ECT include all parents, shareholders, affiliates, employees, attorneys, etc?  Let's be very clear.  I'd also like a covenant not to sue signed by both Clonch and his attorneys.  
 
  
     
 Ms. Cash, the attached is a draft release prepared by Mr. Woody.  Please
