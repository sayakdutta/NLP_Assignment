 Jennifer,
 
 Can you get with Shirley and Vlady and get this meeting scheduled for next week.
 
 Vlady,  I am going to be in the Woodlands in some training Monday and Tuesday so perhaps we can do it later in the week.

 Wes and Wade,
 
 Rick Buy and the RAC/EES team have compiled a list of EES projects, the so-called "Points of Light" list. Its objectives are the following:
 
 	- articulate the progress of EES initiatives to the BOD
 	- ensure that important activities are not overlooked
 	- assign responsibilities to appropriate individuals
 	- monitor completion of projects against a set timetable
 
 I suggest that we revise this list to reflect reality better. Also, you could use this list as a management tool to ensure that in six months EES issues are properly addressed.
 
 I could meet with you and walk you through the "Points of Light" list.
 
 Vlady.
