  This is getting out of hand.  Do we have any master type documents with any 
 Sempra entities and if so what is the relationship of the current party to 
 the one we may have a master with?  If we have no master, then of course we 
 need to have a fully signed GTC confirm signed by both enron and sempra.  
 Thank you.
