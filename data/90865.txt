 
 I called and they have not assigned it yet b/c they are taking a the more severe claims first
 
 
  
     
 Honey, I have talked to maritza and she will come clean Thursday
 Also - if you could follow up on the insurance claim I filed for the tree info is:
 Allstate's South TX claim office ph#1-888-250-6605
 The claim number is 8202536549 filed 8/31 on our homeowner's policy#216939226
 I don't think they assigned an adjustor yet - they said someone from that claims
 office would call us..
