 Let's talk about changing the Canadian reporting relationships - especially risk.  I think that I will propose that to Lavorato today.  But let's talk first.  --Sally

 FYI - this is out there as a possible reason why Americas VaR did not come down to within limits as we expected.
 In the absence of a fix it looks as though we have another VaR violation.

 Kathy,
 It looks like the Canadian positions didn't hit VAR last night.  Can you re-check?
 Also, I understand Zufferli bot a ton of NG and I thought he was short? (Why is system showing he is long?)
