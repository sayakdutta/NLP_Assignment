 Below, please find 2 names of Wharton students who are interested in
 internships this summer.
 
 Thanks,

 Donna, I had also passed along the resumes of two Reliant Energy Tiger Team
 members, David Gershenson and James Iker, who were both interested in
 working for Enron this summer. I had spoken to Vince about these candidates
 when we were in Houston, and he said he would arrange internships for them
 as well.
 He should already have copies of their resumes and cover letters. Please let
 me know if you have any questions or need clarification.
 
 Thanks!!
 Vincent
