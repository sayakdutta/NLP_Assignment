 Susan, 
 Since the following Associates and Analysts are outside of ENA in Corporate, 
 I can't change their supervisor information.   Could you please change the 
 following records to reflect the supervisors named below?
 
 Rahmaan Mwongozi  supv.  David Baumbach
 Robin Rodrigue supv. David Baumbach
 Christopher Walker supv. Darron Giron
 Jennifer Bagwell supv. Darron Giron
 
 Thanks for your help, hgm
