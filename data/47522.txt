 you don't have to do anything!

 Thanks so much for providing the below document.  While I appreciate its 
 simplicity, it does not fully satisfy Enron's requirements.  If it is not too 
 much trouble, could you or Kenneth please provide comments to the agreement 
 provided.
 
 I will be back in my office on Wednesday and can address matters directly 
 with Kenneth or you at that time.
