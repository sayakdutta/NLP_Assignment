 as many people as possible to do the same.  Let's face it, California's gas 
 industry is a mess for the same reasons the electricity industry is a mess 
 (despite, and perhaps contrary to, the substantially more narrow reasoning 
 offered by the Brattle Group).  The CS is a well-thought-out, well-designed 
 program for moving forward; unlike the "interim," which takes two steps 
 back.  Can we split up the names of all the people who signed on and call 
 them and try to get them to show up in support? 
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Watson has asked for time to speak.  I'm planning to continue to support the
 CS.  It brings some greater stability and certainty to SoCalGas' noncore
 rates.  The allocation of backbone capacity might improve shippers'
 certainty of being able to move gas through Topock and Wheeler Ridge.  In
 the short term, it's hard to say how much that might help prices, but I
 doubt that it would make them worse.  In the longer term, if new generation
 on the PG&E and Kern / Mojave systems, plus the North Baja and Questar
 lines, actually reduce SoCalGas' throughput, then a SoCalGas city-gate
 market might be pretty competitive.  Finally, the CS removes SoCalGas'
 favorite argument in favor of the peaking rate.
 
 So what are Edison and Enron going to do?
