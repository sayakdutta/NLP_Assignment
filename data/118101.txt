 Mark -
 
 FYI regarding the BankLogic matter.  I plan on attending to at least see 
 where this is headed.  After looking at the term sheet attached to the 
 earlier memo, I would be happy to be responsible for this project, but this 
 may be a deal Travis is better suited for. 
 
 If you think it is best for you to attend this afternoon, please let me know.
