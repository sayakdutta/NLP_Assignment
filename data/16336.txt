 
 Greetings folks.  We should decide how we want to handle.  One thing I'm not 
 clear on and that I couldn't find in the syllabus is, what's the format for 
 the write up?  If we're called on to discuss, do we simply discuss orally, 
 some sort of simplistic PP slides, spreadsheets, other?  Anyway to discuss 
 between now and Monday, or do we want to just take Dylan up on his offer?
 
 Best,
 Jeff
 
 
 
 


  
 
 Hello all,
 
 I will take a look at the case tonight.
 
 Divvying is fine with me.
