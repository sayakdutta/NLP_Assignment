 Did you attend the Market Affiliate presentation?   If you didn't have the 
 opportunity to make it to one of the sessions held in Houston or Omaha, Dari 
 Dornan is planning to hold a make-up session for the officers.  The video 
 conference room has been reserved for February 10 beginning at 2:00 PM.  Tthe 
 meeting will last approximatel 35 - 40 minutes.
 
 Please let me know if you plan to attend.   If there only a few of you who 
 have't attended, I'll schedule the meeting accordingly.  Thanks,
 
 Virginia
