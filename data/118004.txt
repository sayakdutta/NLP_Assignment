 Although we are still waiting on information from Merrill Lynch, Cliff Baxter 
 has asked that we make every effort to meet Merrill's deadline (tomorrow) for 
 relationship reasons.  
 
 Thanks for the effort.

 I'm waiting on Merrill to verify the transactions.  I will advise.  Thanks.  
 I'm already working with Joe Hunter in financial confirms and Rhonda Denton 
 re. the physical power transactions.
 
 Thanks,

 Just wanted to let you know that I"ll be working on the physical power side 
 and Sara Shackleton will be working on the ISDA side of this deal, so when 
 you get the info ready, you can send it to us directly.  Thanks.
