 
 Thanks.  Steve has been a valuable asset for Enron and ETS which is exactly why other Enron business units are so interested in his services.  I made sure that Steve knew that he could stay with ETS.  The decision was his.  However, we must always remember that sometimes we need do what is in the best interest of Enron and not just ourselves.  Thank you for letting me know your feelings.
  
     
 Stan,
 
 I can only imagine how full your plate is.  Thanks for your visits on the different floors to communicate with ETS personnel.
 
 In these trying times at Enron, everyone is looking to strong, honest leadership to get us throuh this.  Please consider having Steve Hotte remain on board as ETS' CIO for the time being.  He is truly the single, best person I've ever worked for and believe his leadership is much more valuable in ETS than in another area of Enron right now.  
 
 At least ensure Steve has the choice to remain at ETS or move on.  Should he decide to move on, I would respect that and support anyone you name as his replacement.
 
 My "inner voice" told me to send you this message.
 
 Thanks,
 Scott Abshire
 Director, ETS Infrastructure
