 original approval list, but I had them as a U.S. counterparty instead of 
 Canadian.  Credit now tells me they are Canadian, so I am a little concerned 
 that I might have opened them for Credit Derivatives.  So if they are, shut 
 them down since Canadian cpys can't do Credit Derivatives.  Of course, all 
 counterparties should be shut down for Credit Derivatives now unless Credit 
 tells us they are a Credit Derivatives cpy, and then I'll make a 
 determination...but you know that...!
