 
 Greetings Catherine and Roger:
 
 A PUC staffer has called our outside lawyer saying that a high school in 
 Ontario, CA called to complain that we're turning back the school for credit 
 issues.  The staffer says that "a hospital might also be involved."   Can you 
 provide any more information?  The PUC staffer does not seem to have much 
 information, but has nonetheless seems inclined to write us a letter asking 
 us to explain.
 
 Sort of ironic:  PUC Commissioner Woods states that his goal is to drive all 
 ESPs from the state, the Legislature passes and the Governor signs a bill 
 prohibiting Direct Access, and now the PUC is concerned that California might 
 actually be succeeding in its efforts to kill choice.  (The PUC is 
 particularly concerned since they recently passed an order prohibiting gas 
 customers from returning to the LDC---ironic indeed)
 
 Any information that you folks can provide as soon as possible would be 
 greatly appreciated.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
