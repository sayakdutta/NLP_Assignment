 Sounds good to me.  The only days I don't want to meet are the 4th and 5th.

 All right, we have tried to almost complete a whole month without seeing
 eachother.  Now that I have turned thirty, Bridget has run the marathon, and
 Kelly had Luke, we no longer havea excuse not to see eachother.  O.K. Kelly,
 we might make a small exception for you.  I think we should start off with a
 small novella, written by Steve Martin.  Yes, Steve Martin, the comedian.
 He has a short book in the stores; he has written.  It is called Shopgirl.
 The reviews in Amazon are fairly good.  Does anyone else have a good
 suggestion?  I think meeting in the beginning of February would be a good
 idea. -Christina
 P.S. We miised you, Kelly and Anna at my fine party(oh yeah it was for Kelly
 Kampe too!).  Ya'll will just have to hear all about it.
