 
 I have been meaning to email you all day.  I  have been extremely busy as 
 wel.  I am sorry to hear that.  Ashley and I were looking forward to going 
 out to dinner with you guys on Saturday.  Maybe we will call your folks and 
 see if they would like to go out for your dad's bday.  I will have to give 
 him a call tomorrow to wish him happy birthday.  Do you have his number at 
 work or an email at work?  Thanks.
 
 We look forward to seeing you soon.  Take care.
