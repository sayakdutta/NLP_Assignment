 
 Just go ahead and talk to Dave about the other industries.
 
  
     
 John,
 
 I surveyed the group.  In general, people are fine but we should ask for a bit more.  This should apply to US only as Milnthorp has already cut a separate deal with Janet.
 
 EES Proposed that they own all SIC Codes EXCEPT the following:
 
 Mining
 Oil and Gas Extraction
 Paper Manufacturing
 Chemical Manufacturing
 Petroleum and Coal Manufacturing
 Plastics and Rubber Products Manufacturing
 Fertilizer Industry
 Rail Transportation
 
 In our discussion with Dave, we suggested and he agreed that Primary Metals should be added
 
 In discussions with the different regions:
 
 ENA should add: 
 Refining 
 Grain Processing - Baughman and Luce
 Meat Processing - Luce
 Cement Manufacturing - Luce 
 Auto Manufacturing - Luce, Baughman
 Aerospace Manufacturing - Tycholiz, Baughman
 Heavy Industrial Equipment Manufacturing (caterpillar, john deere) - Baughman
 Paper Manufacturing should include - pulp, board, lumber, etc.
 Glass Manufacturing - Luce ( I suspect Dave will resist this because of their Owens Corning deals)
 
 
 Let me know if there is anything else I should do.
 
 Chris
