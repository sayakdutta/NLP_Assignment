 sees an Indian woman thumbing for a ride on the side of the road.
 
 As the trip had been long and quiet, she stops the car and the Indian
 woman gets in.  After a bit of small talk, the Indian woman notices a
 brown bag on the front seat.
 
 "What's in the bag?" asks the Indian woman.
 
 "It's a bottle of wine.  I got it for my husband,"
 says the saleswoman.
 
 The Indian woman is silent for a moment then says, "Good trade."
