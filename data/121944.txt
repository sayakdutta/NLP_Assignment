 
 Hi Ed,
 
 Gosh, I am so sorry we have not connected yet.  I have been on a fast run.  How early in the morning do you come in?  Do I need to be at my desk?  How late in the evening are you in? 
 
 I will make time for you.  Thanks for your persistence.
 
 Kim.

 Hi Kim,
 
 	I'd like to schedule 10 mintues of your time so we can adjust your Business Objects file locations to the new ETS Marketing standard configuration.  When's a good time for you?  I'm available except between 14:00 and 16:00 on Tuesday.  I'd like to help you complete this configuration as soon as possible.
 
 
 Thanks,
 -Ed
