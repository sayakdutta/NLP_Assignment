 you have squandered all rights to your furniture.  Face it, your furniture 
 likes me better anyway now.

 Hendon,
 
 I don't know what to say.  You sounded so official with that email.  How long 
 did it take you to write it?
 
 I'd like to make an announcement.  Hendon has become funny in my absence.  
 Funny ha-ha.
 
 I hope you got a good deal on my wine table.

 I've always thought of you more as a turkey - never an eagle.  Whatever
 floats your boat though.  Just remember you're anything and everything in
 the confines of your own mind  : )
 
 Thanks for the address - I bought your wine table from Gerald (who had
 squatters right on it and could legally sell it to me - he's an attorney,
 remember) .  The rest of your furniture belongs to Gerald - Texas Statue
 013 from the year 1883 - "he that goes to the land of them Yankees forsakes
 all possessions, belongings and all things Texan.  Carpetbaggers and
 Yankees have no claim on any property in the Republic of Texas."
 
 Sorry - wish I could help you out - but the law is the law.  Have fun at
 the game.
 
 Brian
