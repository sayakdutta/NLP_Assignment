 
 Attached is a clean and redlined version of the Capacity Assignment and 
 Release doc. for Calpine.  The redline has Calpine changes in light purple 
 with Enron's changes is red.  Please review.
 
 Stephanie, I did not resend the revised confirm which I sent earlier today.  
 There were no changes to that doc. since the revised version I sent this 
 morning.
