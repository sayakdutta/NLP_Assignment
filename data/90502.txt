Please give me a solution that keeps the employee and saves the company money by avoiding replacement cost at 75-80k.   This seems like a real simple business decision and we are making it difficult.

 After forwarding your request for a employment agreement renewal for Dean Laurent to Oxley, he brought forward the following points.  It seems the suggestion is that the proposed raise is too much in one go.  Perhaps we could go with a figure I mentioned in an earlier email say 55k.  It is also suggested that we forgo a  "contract" and substitute a  90 day evergreen no-compete instead. I think the sentiment would be to avoid contracts for folks below the level of manager when possible.  I think the thought process is to put a desirable package in front of the candidate that commits them to the organization utilizing another tool.
