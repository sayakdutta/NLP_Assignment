 I have been forwarding these messages at Rick's request.  Going forward,
 perhaps either of you could contact Mary Cook to be added to the
 distribution list.  Thanks.

 1.  Be sure to verify that the underlying contracts do not allow cherry
 picking under any default scenario.  If it does, amend the express
 language.
 
 2.  We have made 2 changes to the netting agreement forms on the basis
 of further review by Leslie Hansen of some provisions in our trading
 forms.  The first change is in paragraph 2(a) to clarify the definition
 of Default.  The second change is in paragraph 14(b) to delete the day
 limitation on claims of Force Majeure.  We feel this should not be
 included in any physical contract that will be included in a master
 netting agreement, especially because of the current international
 situation and security concerns.
 
 See attached reline version to read the changes.
 
  <<MASTER NETTING & SECURITY AGMNT 10 H V1 RED.DOC>>
 3.  No changes have been made to the Collateral Annex.
 
 4.  Attached below are the new forms.  Rather than continue with forms
 with and without the user notes, I put the user notes in a separate
 document.  They are not at the back of the forms.  Simpler.
 
  <<Master Netting User Notes.doc>>
 
 The attached forms are Master Netting & Security Agmnt 10 h a v1 (to use
 without collateral annex) and Master Netting & Security Agmnt 10 h v1
 (to use with collateral annex).
