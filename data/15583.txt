 
 FYI.  Hertzberg and Keeley were in the negotiations this morning.  We gave 
 him an earful about this coming down the pike, and the fact that the 
 contracts (which are too expensive and which no one wants) are driving 
 everything and unless something gives, we can pack it up, go home and turn 
 the keys over the Freeman and his bozos at DWR.  
 
 The Sacramento types are mobilized on the issue and Hertzberg said that he's 
 going to meet with the Governor and call Loretta.  We meet again tomorrow at 
 10 to discuss the need to get rid of the contracts and to keep DA alive.  
 I'll report back with any pertinent info.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
