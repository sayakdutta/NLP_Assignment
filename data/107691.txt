 
 so i had dinner with a college student.  could you break up with mark and 
 date me?  that would be very helpful.  I really don't want to hear about 
 someone's major for god sakes.
 should i put myself on ebay?

 good luck!  think positively!
 
 
    
 Oh my god--so much desire to run, but i have a dinner tonight--my last since 
 it's time to get into shape.  Maybe I'll wire my jaws shut.  If my dinner is 
 with a 19 yr old, I'm going to take the fork and poke holes in myself.  (That 
 was my dream) 
 I'll tell you about it tomorrow...
