 
 Sure. 
 
 The fix we want to make on the drug/alcohol policy is as follows:  instead of 
 a reference to a specific numbered policy, the purchaser will provide ABB 
 with a copy of their policy, and ABB will comply with it.

 Can I release a preliminary draft to Alan?
 
 
     
 
 Peter--I saw the breakout contract for the CA project that you sent out.
 Could you send me the current draft, in whatever shape it's in, for the
 Fountain Valley ABB contract?  I need whatever you have first thing
 tomorrow ( for dealing with NEPCo, our EPC contractor to arrive at a
 final
 EPC contract price, not for dealing with GE or E-Next Generation LLC).
 Thanks.
