 Mark,
 
 Have you had a chance to look at this?  The attached file is the new index (website address) and the following language is another example of an index currently on EnronOnline which uses a web address.
 
 The Floating Price during a Determination Period shall be the average of the hourly prices listed in the Index for electricity delivered during Peak hours on each Delivery Day during the applicable Determination Period.  The Floating Price for each Determination Period shall be calculated utilizing the hourly clearing prices published by PJM Interconnection, LLC on its official web site currently located at ftp://www.pjm.com/pub/account/lmp/index.html, or any successor thereto, under the headings "PJM - Locational Marginal Pricing Files; Western Hub"  (the "Index").
