 
 Stan,
 
 I have one minor question.  
 
 Is the Notice to Proceed Effective Date a set date, or is it x days following 
 y event? 
 
 I would expect to see language along the lines of "If notice to proceed is 
 not given by the Notice to Proceed Effective Date, then...".  I see the 
 deleted language was something close to that, so maybe in the context of this 
 EPC different terminology is used.
