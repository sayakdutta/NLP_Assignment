 BEWARE!  This ISDA was almost finalized but for disagreement about assignment 
 and arbitration (so there's not much in the Annex A to dispute).  Check Lotus 
 Notes first and add to this file.

 Hi Sara, Maria Gelnett from New York State Electric & Gas called me.  She 
 would like to talk to an attorney about annex A that is attached to the 
 financial confirmation letters that we send them.  I have attached the 
 confirmation letter that she is reviewing.
 
 
 
 Maria's phone number is (607) 762-7688.
 
 Thanks,
 Melissa
