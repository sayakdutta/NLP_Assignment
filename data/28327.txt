 Rudi,
 
 Below is ETS Risk Management Policy, which we would like Corporate to review 
 before it is presented to management for approval and limit establishment.  I 
 have also attached a 1st draft of the Risk Management Procedures and Controls 
 that while not all are fully in place we expect them to be operational once 
 transactional active increases. 
 
 Rudi, who would be the person to check with on this policy.
