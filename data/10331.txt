 to acknowledge this situation to us.  Hope all is well for you.  I enjoyed
 the opportunity to work with you on Mauro's trip.  Take care.  Lynn
 
 
     
 
 Hi, Lynn - Did you get a copy of this from Mauro?  I thought it was very touching.  
 
 
     
 Dear Rebecca,
 that sorrow tragedy, those coward attacks are beyond any expression of sadness and reproach.
 I do believe that those who are responsible for the cowardly attacks be soon discovered and punished.
 I also feel that in these times there is at stake the fundamental issue of Liberty, for all of us.
 Just before coming to visit you I took part to a conference in Dallas, where Chairman WiIlliams of RCC gave a speech. 
 It occurs to me recalling his words to the audience, at the end of his speech
 God Bless America, and God Bless You
