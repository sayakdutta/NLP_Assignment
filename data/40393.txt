 Note attached SDG&E press release calling on Governor Davis to use his
 emergency powers to remedy the accelerating energy crisis by taking a
 number of actions, e.g., directing local air districts to temporarily lift
 emissions limits for in-state power plants so that the plants which have
 met or exceeded their air-emissions limits can run.  In addition, SDG&E
 reported it made an emergency filing with FERC requesting an immediate
 reinstatement of price caps on interstate natural gas pipeline
 transportation to the CA border.
