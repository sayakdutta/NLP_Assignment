 Please pass along our thanks for the invitation.  I have confirmed that 
 Saturday evening is the only time I will have an opportunity to see my 
 brother, therefore I will be unable to attend.  In addition, Mike checked his 
 calendar and found out that he and his wife have been committed for several 
 weeks to attend a social engagement on that evening.
 
 Again, thanks.
 
 Cathy Phillips and 
 Mike McConnell
