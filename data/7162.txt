 
 I knew that you would still be in London.  Just thought that I would start to 
 copy you on some things so that you could begin to get a feel for what's 
 going on.  Yes, I will be in London next week.  Plan to fly over on Sunday 
 night and will be in the office around noon on Monday.  I will be there 
 through Thursday, and will plan to fly back to Houston on Friday.  Let's 
 definitely plan to get together.  I am in the throws of bonus reviews at this 
 moment (I am cooling my heels waiting for HR to get me info on people that 
 were left off of my sheet), so a little later today I will focus on my 
 schedule for next week.  I will send an e:mail later in the day to see when 
 we can get together.  Looking forward to it.  --Sally

 I guess you know I am here in London this week wrapping up -- wish I could be 
 there for this meeting.
 
 Are you still coming next week?   It would be good to get together.  
 
 Let me know  -- I will try to call this afternoon

 Please join me on Thursday, January 11 from 1:00 to 4:00 pm for a special 
 information session for the Operations Management teams supporting Enron 
 Americas, Enron Global Markets and Enron Industrial Markets.   We will focus 
 on assessing, managing and mitigating operational risk.  Details on the 
 location for the meeting will be sent to you early next week.  
 
 I look forward to seeing everyone at this meeting on the 11th.  The things 
 that we will discuss will be important for each and every one of you as you 
 carry out your roles in 2001.  I hope that you will make every effort to 
 attend.  Please let me know as soon as possible if you have a conflict that 
 will keep you from attending the meeting.
