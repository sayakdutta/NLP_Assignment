 
 That's strange - I entered these deals for Matt yesterday, and specifically 
 typed 2 p.m. into the expiry date. Somehow it changed over, but I've changed 
 it back and re-saved it - so it should read 2 PM.
 
 Thanks for catching that,
 Kate

 Kate, can you please ask Matt about expiry time, the deal strip says 2:00 AM 
 it should be 2:00 PM on both.  thanks
