 
 Joe, 
 
 Thanks for your message. It would be difficult to rearrange  the meeting at 
 this point, given that it was 
 timed around the availability of Jeff Skilling. I doubt we could get Jeff for 
 any other date at this point. We can still adjust
 the agenda to discuss and address the Content Services issues. I shall work 
 on this with John and Ravi.

 I could probably make Friday but would have to leave that night.  Any chance 
 it could be moved to the first of the next week.
 
 Also, I think it is important that as we examine the technical issue of our 
 network and network functionality that we balance the meeting with the 
 Content Services issues and requirements.  I talked to John about this 
 already.

 Joe,
 
 I would like to invite you to an off-site meeting of John Griebling's 
 organization
 and the Research Group. 
 
  Location:  Breckenridge, Colorado
 
 
 As you know, John Griebling is managing the network design and construction 
 project
 currently under way in EBS. The Research Group is actively involved in this 
 effort
 which requires advanced quantitative skills in the area of stochastic 
 optimization and
 stochastic processes (for modeling and forecasting Internet traffic flows).
 
 The objective of this meeting is to develop common language and accomplish 
 transfer 
 of skills between the two groups, to facilitate cooperation on this project 
 in the future.
 
 We are inviting Ken Rice and Kevin Hannon to this meeting. We would 
 appreciate if you could
 speak, together with Kevin and Ken, on strategic directions of EBS. It is 
 important for a group
 of technical people, with relatively specialized technical skills, to 
 understand the big picture.
 
 I am attaching the preliminary agenda for this meeting.
 
 Vince Kaminski
