 Debra,
 
 The only confirm I've been able to print is for Sitara deal 131153 (Tagg 
 N47394.1) and this one is weird:  the deal was a two-month firm deal covering 
 12/01/99 - 01/31/00.  Since firm deals over a month should not be confirmed 
 under a GISB, this deal was split and 01/00 was moved to Sitara deal 133958 
 (cannot find Tagg number).  Deal 131153 was originally confirmed under a 
 Master Purchase Sale Firm but moved to the GISB following the correction of 
 the CP name on the deal ticket.  The deal was not reconfirmed under the GISB 
 to the best of my knowledge; I couldn't locate the deal in Livelink (the only 
 confirms under that deal number were for EPMI deals) and could only print the 
 confirm out of Tagg. 
 
 I could not locate the other deal numbers at all in Tagg and there are no 
 records in Livelink of the confirms either (only EPMI deals).  I'm guessing 
 the deals were confirmed out of DCAF, but I don't have access to that.  
 Someone in the Confirms group will have to print those for you.  One note:  
 The last deal, Sitara 107197, is a five-month firm deal that should NOT have 
 been attached to the GISB.
 
 Since these are HPL deals, I'm not sure who confirms them, but you could 
 probably get some help from either Ellen Wallumrod, Ann Osire, or Richard 
 Deming.  On the contract side, Cheryl Dudley or Amelia Alland should be able 
 to help.  I'm afraid I've done all I can on this end.
 
 I'm getting ready to fax the confirm for deal 131153 (before it was split) 
 since it's the only record I could pull up.
 
 Sorry I couldn't find you everything!
 SBR
