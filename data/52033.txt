 
 Al,
 
 I have spoken with Mark Lay and he is interested.
 Even if we cannot help you here in Enron, he may be able
 to put you in touch with other CV groups in town.
 
 Please, call him directly and give my name as a reference.
 (713) 853-7408
 
 Good luck.
 
 Vince

 I have called Mark Lay and left a message on his voice mail.

 Vince:  Your suggestion to introduce the concept discussed with one of
 the Lays is welcomed.  I hope that this would mean that you would remain
 involved at some level.  The design of the model and its potential
 economics could be key to how worthy the effort might be.   Enron could
 be an ideal environment from which to the concept enhancement through to
 commercialization could be successfully accomplished.  Please
 confidentially share matters as you think best and advise me of the
 interest generated.  I am ready to meet there at your building or
 elsewhere that is appropriate.  Best regards,  Al Arfsten 713 965 2158
