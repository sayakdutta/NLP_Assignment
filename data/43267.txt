 Thanks for the article. It was good to see and talk to you again, if you need
 help scheduling a time in dec. for Orlando let me know if I can help. Good
 luck with your decision making in the coming weeks and know that the quality
 of your christmas gift depends on the amount of my enron losses. !!!!! But
 don't allow that to interfere with right and wrong. Keep in touch when you
 can.  Ken
