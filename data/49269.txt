 
 Frank,
 
 I am definitely interested in the resume. I can meet the candidate on campus 
 when
 I visit my son. I am planning to come to Palo Alto around Thanksgiving.
 
 Also, Energy and Power Risk Management (an English publication)
 organizes every year in Houston a POWER RISK conference (typically in May).
 They ask me for recommendations regarding
 speakers. Would you be interested in participating?

 Vince,
 
   I am writing about a student of mine who is on the job market
 this year.  When you stopped by my office, about 18 months ago
 you asked if I had any students that might be appropriate for
 your group.  Although I didn't at the time, now I do.  This student has
 excellent technical skills, including an M.S. in Statistics
 and a Ph.D. in Economics by the end of the current academic
 year.  His dissertation research is on the investment behavior
 of Independent Power Producers in the US.  As a result of research
 assistance he has done for me, he knows the California market very well
 and is familiar with the other ISOs.  I think he would be an excellent
 match for you.  The only problem is that he will probably have many
 other options available.  However, I definitely think he's worth a look.
 If you'd like him to send you a CV, please let me know.  Thanks.
