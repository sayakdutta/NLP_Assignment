 I am attaching a memo I prepared - Steffes did a bulletized version that we'll forward.  Also, I send the schedule and summary/update of current status
  << File: watkiss-fergus M E M O R A N D U M.doc >> 
  
     
 As I talked with Jim yesterday, Belden would like a short overview of the refund proceedings:  schedule, key issues, etc.
 
 If you can pass on whatever you have I can prepare such a memo.  Or let me know and I can call Fergus.
 
 Thnks.
