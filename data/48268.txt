 
 On the list for 3/20/00, the only counterparty I am responding for is 
 Carthage Energy.  Eventually I will be making the Australian responses, but 
 we are not there yet.
 
 On the 3/21/00 list, National Energy was amended, and I had no changes to my 
 previous approvals.  Western Resources is an amended counterparty and I am 
 opening them up for all financial and power.
