 
 John,
 
 What about Thursday, 10:30 a.m.? I have just come back from Europe
 last night and I am trying to organize my schedule for the next few days.
 
 My phone number is 713 853 3848.

 Vince,
 
 Can I call you Tuesday morning about our writing project?  I have to be in
 Austin for a dental appointment on Monday at noon and that will probably
 wipe out the day.  Give me a time and number where I can reach you.
 
 John
