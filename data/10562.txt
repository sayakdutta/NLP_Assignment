 (I have installed a modem and configured Shirleys desktop for dial-in access. This method of access will only be used if her
 high speed connection is not available. I've also mapped he drive to access the data on gthou-dv04. She has my number if 
 she needs further assistance.
 
 Thanks, Glenn

 The following summarizes the action items we identified in our meeting this afternoon:
 Updated the Remedy records for Beverly, Shirley and Mary that they are Work At Home participants; to give their requests high priority; and to assign them to Glenn and Robert, when possible.
 Glenn obtained a modem for Shirley and will install it tomorrow when she brings her system in.  He will map the drive (T:\) at the same time.
 Sent John the note regarding completing the eRequest for reestablishing VPN access.
 Will investigate the CITRIX Server not available message after new access is established and tested.
 
 Please let me know if anything has been overlooked.  Otherwise, we will continue to work the issues above.
