 
 Can I expect any kind of payback from my contractor for giving him such a 
 high rating?

 Tana when you have a  chance could you do me a favor and go to 
 www.contractor.com and do a search for  contractor by name then enter my name 
 and then my company name will come up and  then click on the link to rate 
 this contractor. Then fill out the form and rate  your favorite contractor 
 and of course you must give me high  marks.
 ?
 How are you  doing?
