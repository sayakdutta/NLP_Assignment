 Yes Chris I can draft a termination letter.  The termination notice period is 6 months prior  written notice to either party.
 
 
 Let me know who it should be addressed to and I will draft the letter and forward it prior to December 1, 2001 which will give the counterparty 6 month prior written notice.  I will have to have it executed by the proper parties of course.
 
 
 I will wait to hear from you.
