 Sara,
 
 I think the sleeping giant is awakening....Can you e-mail or send me a copy 
 of the black-lined (latest) version of the P&G Master ISDA???
 
 We'd like to start this process again.  Please include any changes to the 
 schedule or credit support annex that have been made over the last 12 months.
 
 Thanks; please call me if this is a problem or with any questions.
