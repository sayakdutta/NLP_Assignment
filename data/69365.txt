 
 The room is $440 per couple for the four nights or $220 per person.  The fest 
 tickets are $15 a day and people usually go 2 of the three days.  there is 
 also a Harrah's casino across the street from our condo.  The condo's have 
 kitchen's in them so people and buy groceries and stuff and eat there mainly.
 
 We go every year and have a blast.  If you are interested let me know.
