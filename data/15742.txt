 Jeff-
 I think their predictions are correct about members getting active -- though
 next week is mostly ceremonious I do expect there to be many bills
 introduced on the subject. I agree that the agenda looks ambitious but our
 hope is directly in line with yours -- the material is background for what I
 hope is lively and productive discussion. Glad you can make it. See you
 there!

 Thanks, Delaney.  See you on Friday.
 
 Quick comment:  Though just about everything's uncertain these days, folks
 seem to think that Legislators are likely to get very active just as soon
 as they arrive in Sacramento (next week?).  Seems that a key--if not
 dominant--part of the agenda ought to be how this group can (quickly) come
 to agreement on a comprehensive solution that it can offer to the
 Legislature and the Governor as a pragmatic and positive way out.  Sure you
 folks are very focused on this, but it struck me that the agenda looks
 pretty ambitious for a 3-hour meeting.  In any case, just a thought that I
 wanted to share.
 
 Thanks and can't thank you enough for all your efforts.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
