 
 i have to be in denver that weekend for a family function.  what about labor 
 day?  we could go that fri & sat night and fly back sun.  we would have 
 monday off to recover.  lsu is playing some schmeg team any way.  there will 
 be more cougars in vegas over labor day also.  cougars are good back up plan 
 at the end of the night.  
 
 
 
 




  
  
 
 25th is ideal.
 Lenny why can't you make this date?
 Jacques, let me know when you have something definite so I can get a flight.
 Al are you going to come?
 Keep in touch.
