 The following power point presentation graphically sets forth the steps 
 necessary to integrate MG plc into Enron NetWorks L.P.  This presentation 
 differs from that sent to several of you last week in that there are now 
 dotted lines in red around those pieces of MG that are affected at each stage 
 of the reorganization and solid red lines around the same pieces reflecting 
 where they wind up at each such stage - hopefully a more friendly on the eyes 
 presentation.  Please do not hesitate to call regarding any piece of the 
 presentation.  My best to all.  Steve.
