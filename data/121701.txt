 How are you?  (Do you remember me - from El Tiempo?)  Just wanted to touch base with you about sailing lessons.  Although the Austrailia trip sounds really cool - I don't think I can manage this year.  Also, I did commit to doing this with one of my friends - can't leave him in the dust!!  Anyway, can you recommend a good place for lessons in Keemah?  Maybe the place you are taking your lessons to be an instructor?  I would appreciate any recommendations!!  Going to AZ tonight - I'm sure I will run into you when I get back.
 
 Have a great weekend,
 
 Kim Ward
