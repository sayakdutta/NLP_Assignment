 Kay  - is there a contract in place between Turbo Park and GE or has the West 
 LB contract and all of the change orders been assigned to GE?  If it has been 
 assigned then the change order sequential numbers must remain in Place.  If 
 you have a new contract in Place then the Change order could be number 0ne.  
 Who is maintaining the change order log.  What do you mean by site specific 
 stuff?  Who has a copy of the new contract?

 Gentlemen,
 
 Since we are moving the equipment from WestLB and into TurboPark, and since 
 we are just about there with the breakout contracts, we need to process this 
 as change order #1 to the Fountain Valley contract.  I also believe we need 
 the site specific stuff for this project.

 Attachment contains latest revision reflecting order for two additional
 stacks, six power stabilizers and moving cost for the Fountain Valley
 Project.  Please review and let me know if additional changes are required
 or recommended.
