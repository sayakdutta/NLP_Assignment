 down Louisville Gas and Electric Company and Lower Colorado River Authority 
 from both execute and view status for power.  With respect to Lower Colorado 
 River Authority and bandwidth, I spoke to the Broadband team, and they 
 haven't considered the governmental angle with respect to bandwidth, so they 
 are running it by outside counsel (who happens to be in Singapore this week), 
 and will get back to me.  So until I hear otherwise, I am shutting them down 
 for bandwidth.
