 
 Martha,
  
 I'm sorry you had to miss lunch today.  Frank also brought Mark Pickering (they worked together at EBS).  Frank and Mark are working on business development for Plains.  He very much wants to catch up with you, I told him you would give him a call.
  
 His office number is 713 739-6715  (if 739 doesn't work, try 729, the voice mail was fuzzy).  His cell phone is 713 503-9027 (I know this number is correct).
  
 Please give him a call.  He is very happy in his new role.  My lunch with him today did remind me of the "good ole days" you and I had with him.  
  
 Give me a shout when you get back into the office.  
  
  
 Thanks, Kim
  
  
 P.S.  We moved up to 39 last weekend.  I finally went through all my boxes from the office you and I shared on 41.  Some of the stuff was yours, so I packed you one box and put it on your desk.  (Sorry.......)  Call me.
 
 
     Importance: High
 
 
 Kim - I cannot make lunch today with you and Frank.   My husband scheduled a meeting with our financial guy over the noon hour, unaware that I had this planned.    I am OK for you two to go to lunch but I would like to call Frank.  Do you have his number?  Where does he work now?
  
 My apologies for the late notice .....  your friend, Martha
