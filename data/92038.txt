 The bill for 10/28/2001 may be put on hold due to problems encountered with
 Performance Tracking System data.  The problem is associated with the time
 change from DST to EST.  An update on the status of NYISO's efforts to
 address this problem will be posted mid-afternoon tomorrow.
 
 Regards,
 Randy Bowers
 Manager - Customer Settlements
