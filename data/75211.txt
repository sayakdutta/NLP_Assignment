 
 I have a phone number on a post it note on my cabinet, just to the right of 
 where my computer would be if I was there.  It is a lawyers name (which of 
 course I can't remember), male, with a 212 or 202 phone number.  It may be 
 David something or other.  Could you email me that name and number?
 
 Do you know if there is a way for me to save my emails that I have in folders?
 
 Bet the weather is better than this in San Fran.
