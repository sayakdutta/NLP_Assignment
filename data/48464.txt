 It sounds like we may not need to follow up with this counterparty.  Any dealmaker interested in business with them?  If not, I think we should just inactivate them.
  
     
 This Cp was primarily interest in price discovery and was going to consider whether to pursue EOL access.  I informed them that if they want EOL access, I need documentation re municipal authority.  They never followed up with me.

 This counterparty was on the 8/15/01 list and wanted to trade east power.  You wre checking on their ability to trade power.  Any update?
