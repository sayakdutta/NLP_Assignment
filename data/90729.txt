 
 Eric,
 
 John is comfortable with sending out a 5 year curve to Egypt
 also he does not want to adjust the length of the forward price curve in the system due to non liquidity in the market that far forward

 Dutch,
 
 Per our conversation last week, can the gas price curve be extended out past 2024?  Also,  could you ask John about sending Egypt a historical forward curve.  They would like to see a couple of historical curves from the last 6 months out as far as we are willing to go.
 
 I'll check back with you this afternoon. 
 
 Thanks again.
 
 Eric
