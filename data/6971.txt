 I guess last  time you were just nervous- with me being there and all.  I'm 
 sorry that I make you a little nervous- although it is quite understandable 
 that you would feel that way.
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
   
  
 we won both games, of course.  i was 3-6 with a double off the fence - and 
 you missed it!  One guy on our team hit a home run in back-back at bats.

 Good morning!!  How was your little games?  Did ya'll win?  Any homeruns 
 hit?  I was in bed for 9:45 last night- and I am still tired this morning- 
 what is wrong with me?  Anyhow- hope you have a good day- call me later when 
 you get a chance.
