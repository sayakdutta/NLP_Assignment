 FYI,   There is a rumor on Yahoo that Enron has bid for Carin Energy.  I have 
 talked with Jackie Gentle in our London Office who first heard the rumor and 
 we have confirmed that neither EGEP or the London office is pursuing such a 
 deal.  My guess is that it is either EOGR ( I know they are pursuing an Int'l 
 deal) or just a bad release.
