 Hi Vince,
 ?
 I'm sorry you weren't around in Sydney this week.  You missed a very good 
 book launch party that John Martin organised here for us.  Paul made a short 
 speech in which he relayed some great comments which he said  came from?you - 
 thanks very much!
 ?
 Please find attached the next EPRM article. Its not  really tided up fully 
 from our end yet, but I wanted to send it off before the  weekend in case you 
 got chance to look at it. Because of the Easter break Robin  is after it by 
 Thursday of next week.
 ?
 Best regards.
 ?
 Chris.
