 
 Katherine, 
 
 There are 2 ways that I can enter this fee into Sitara:
 1) I can put the dollar amount in on day 1 as a demand or facility fee.
 
 2) I need you to give me volume(s) and a price to input into the deal.  I 
 can't just input a dollar amount in Sitara.
 
 Let me know how you want to handle it.
