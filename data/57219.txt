 Steve,
 
 
 Please, let  me know when you come back.
 
 I have detected a tendency to implement different
 
 approaches to valuation in the past.
 
 
 To some extent, it reflects the absence of formal
 
 rules for sign-off on the valuation techniques
 
 which, in turn, reflects,  the turf wars and the desire by the
 
 originators to control the outcomes.

 Vince,
 
 
 I'd like an opportunity to talk to you about valuation.
 
 
 I'm hearing confusing messages about the way that the UK IT team and the UK
 
 traders get their Valuation code aparently signed off by Research, while
 
 here... You provide it for our guys to wrap up.
 
 
 We have now a situation where the UK team are using a home grown Valuation
 
 piece called DOVE, where results differ from those of the equivalent USA
 
 portcalc.
 
 
 I need to break through the pride barriers and the "not built here"
 
 syndrome, and try to do the right thing, but I don't beleive I can do that
 
 without you guidance.
 
 
 I'm scared that if we diverge too much we will never work globally on these
 
 systems.
