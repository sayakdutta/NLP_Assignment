 
 I'll get back to you today.  Houston is dealing with some pretty big issues, but I'm going to push them to meet with you nonetheless.  How's the weather in the big apple?  You vote for Green or Bloomberg?
 
 
     
 
 
 Do you have any more info about the meeting on the 13th.  It looks like mid morning would be a good time (if the meeting is still going to happen).  I obviously understand if you have bigger issues to deal with, but I have to arrange plane flights for myself and Marc if necessary.
 
 I hope things are going well.
