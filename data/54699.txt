 Dear Vince,
 
 I am a rotating associate and would like to learn more about opportunities 
 within your group. I have worked in RAC and am currently in Financial 
 Trading. I believe the Associate/Analyst program may forward you my CV, but I 
 thought it good to get in touch personally. 
 Please let me know if there is someone with whom I could speak about the 
 group and its needs for associates. 
 
 With best regards,
 Kate
