 
 Norma,
 
 I am sending you an Excel spreadsheet with proposed
 merit and equity increases.
 
 I have slightly exceeded the merit quota.
 The equity increases address two issues: retention and
 and an error in setting a salary at hiring (I tend to be too stingy).
 
 Please, let me know if there are any questions.
 I am forwarding a copy of the spreadsheet to my home address
 so I can work on it tonight, if necessary.
 
 Vince
