 
 John,  Attached are the case historys for the two cases.  Note:
 
 Followed - means the court followed the holding in the case cited
 Dissenting Opinion - means the dissenting justices referenced the case only 
 (not really relevant)
 Distinguished - court didn't follow the holding of the case or simply found 
 that the facts of the two cases were different.
 
 Hope this helps.
