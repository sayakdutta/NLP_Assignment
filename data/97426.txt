 hi guys...i know that over the past few weeks i have been asking you guys if
 you could come out to a prebon/ene dinner on next thursday may 31st at a
 site t.b.d......the day is about a week away now and i hope that we can all
 still hang out...i'm emailing you guys to see who is still in or if there
 are any ":flakes" as the date grows closer...additionally...where would you
 guys like to go?....any place new in houston that we need to check out ?
 just let me know so i can make the plans and if i left anybody out who wants
 to go ( sneal, griggs, martin, huntman, frank ) the more the better as far
 as i'm concerned...thanks
