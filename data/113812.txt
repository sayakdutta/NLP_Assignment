 Janet,  
 
 Would you be interested in doing this gas deal?  What are the ranges of customers that you would sell to?  Give me a call,  Mary Jo
 
     
 Mary Jo:
 Per our conversation below, could you take a quick look at the data below and see if Varn International is a company we can work with?
 
 Thanks.
 
 
 Believe it or not, I am currently working in the Northwest side of Houston  
 with Varn International.  Our parent company, Day International,  has  
 facilities located in Michigan and North Carolina.   Would you be so kind and  
 point me in the right direction as to who might handle the Carolina Power and  
 Light account in Ashville, NC as well as the American Electric Power account  
 in Three Rivers Michigan.  Our Day plants have been using brokers but I  
 thought we might could work with Enron, if they are in that market area, and  
 possibly negotiate some long term agreement for all our facilities.  Once  
 they found out I had natural gas experience, they put me on this project.   
 Otherwise I'm responsible for purchasing and logistics for North America and  
 eventually worldwide.
