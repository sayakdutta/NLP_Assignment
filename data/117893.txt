 By now, you should all have your travel plans finalized.  Please help us in 
 planning by providing your itinerary including flights and arrival/departure 
 times to Marvia Jefferson if you haven't already done so.  We need this by 
 tomorrow morning if possible, so we can finalize all plans for meals and 
 transportation.   Please review the attached document for additional details 
 on the ASE event including hotel, transportation, and schedule.  Changes from 
 the previous communication have been highlighted in blue.
 
 
 
 In addition, here are driving directions to and from various places should 
 you require them.
 
 
 
 Should you have any further questions, please feel free to call either myself 
 at x3-6079 or Marvia at x3-9165.
 
 See you in Dallas!
