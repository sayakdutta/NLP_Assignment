 Sara,
 
 An Interest Rate swap was entered into with the above counterparty in October 
 1997.  This was part of a large structured Coal deal.  (Coal Capital Co.?)  I 
 believe the confirm was created in Legal.   Is it possible for me to get a 
 copy of this confirmation?  We are having a real problem getting this 
 settlement booked each month, so we want to refer to confirm to see what is 
 said.  I am out next week, but could you ask someone to send a copy to Todd 
 Warwick?  he is in ENA reporting and is helping me out with this.  Thanks.
