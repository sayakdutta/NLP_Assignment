 
 Attached is a very rough draft of the O&M Agreement based on our 
 discussions.   There are several blanks concerning the numbers and I have 
 noted several questions thoughout the agreement that need further 
 clarification.  I am okay with sending this to the operator with the caveat 
 that although the general substance of the agreement is in place, there may 
 be some further changes to the language after further review.  Please review.
