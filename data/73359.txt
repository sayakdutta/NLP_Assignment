 Legal folks -- please let me know of any other legal people who should be 
 added to interconnection issue emails.
 
 
 On May 16, FERC clarified its policy regarding credits for network upgrades 
 associated with the interconnection of a generating facility -- all network 
 upgrade costs (the cost of all facilities from the point where the generator 
 connects to the grid), including those necessary to remedy short-circuit and 
 stability problems, should be credited back to the customer that funded the 
 upgrades once the delivery service begins.
 
 Once a customer signs up for transmission, then the transmission provider is 
 limited to charging the higher of the expansion cost or an embedded cost rate.
 
 Generally, Enron has not procured transmission at the time of interconnection 
 and therefore, may be required to pay the network upgrades at the time of 
 interconnection; however, the order clarifies that a credit should be 
 available to the interconnecting customer or a third party that contracts for 
 transmission away from the generator.
