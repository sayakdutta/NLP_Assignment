 We have new book names in TAGG for our intramonth portfolios and it is 
 extremely important that any deal booked to the East is communicated quickly 
 to someone on my team.  I know it will take some time for the new names to 
 sink in and I do not want us to miss any positions or P&L.  
 
 Thanks for your help on this.
 
 New:
 Scott Neal :         East Northeast
 Dick Jenkins:     East Marketeast
