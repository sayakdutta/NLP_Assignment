 Steve,
 
 Thanks for your courtesy this morning, and recommendations for further 
 contacts.  (By copy of this transmission I'm sending my resume' on to Rick, 
 Jose' and Miguel, as you suggested.)  Much of the work I've done in the last 
 fifteen years has been involved government affairs, in one way or another.  
 Either I was dealing with state and federal regulatory agencies in the US, 
 working on political campaigns in Florida and Texas, or negotiating with 
 international governments preparing for purchase of utility concessions.  All 
 while developing strategy, building and organizing teams to execute the work, 
 and seeing to it that the job got done.
 
 Three documents are attached.  I suggest this order to read them: 
 #1 "JPO Res Addendum" gives you a view looking forward (where I'll go, what I 
 can do) as all resumes should.
 #2 "JPO Res Exec Summ" gives you a view looking back (where I've been, what 
 I've done) as all resumes would.
 #3 "JPO Res Full CV" gives detail on specific assignments and projects 
 (essentially an expanded version of #2).
 
 
 Hope the holidays are joyous and safe for all.
 
 Best regards,
 
 J. Paul
