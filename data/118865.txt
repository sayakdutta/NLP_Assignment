 
 We generally do not give legal advice to our counterparties - regarding tax 
 or other legal consequences to their trading.  The only thing we could safely 
 say would be something to the effect of "If you are concerned about the tax 
 consequences of your EnronOnline transactions, please consult your tax 
 advisor."

 In your FAQ, could you please put something about the tax consequences for 
 Japanese counterparties
 
 Also, sorry to rush you but we really need something by Friday Tokyo time so 
 that we can put in in for translation.
