 As a follow up to your  email I spoke to Janet Butler again about the ability 
 to view FERC meetings.  Jan told me that the password is not tied to one 
 location.  The password works for all locations.  A location equals a 
 person/user.  The only requirement is to have Real Video access which Jan 
 informs me is on the ENA Lan.  My understanding from Jan Butler is that the 
 cost is $90 per user/location per month.
 
 I will send the request to Jan to add two users/locations per your request.  
 Jan will need names for the locations.  Do you want the locations to be in 
 your name and Steve's or how do you want to set that up.

 Eric - A couple of questions:
 
 - Is the subscription dedicated to a particular user name, or is it something 
 like a membership number? It would be helpful to be able to be able to watch 
 the big meetings on one of the plasma screens, which would work with either 
 login method.  If the subscription is tied to a membership number we could 
 use any machine as the projecting machine.
 - Is Real Video part of the Enron standard offering, special software that 
 we'd need to order, or a freebie we can download like RealPlayer?
 
 Thanks!

 Mr. Kean - 
 
 Per your request, I spoke to Janet Butler yesterday after the FERC meeting on 
 options available to our group to view FERC meetings.  Janet told me that 
 Shelley's group has an annual contract with Capitol Connection that costs 
 $500 plus $90 for every additional connection annually.  The contract is 
 being renewed in the next week.  Janet indicated that Shelley's group pays 
 the charges and bills to our cost center.
 
 Capitol Connection allows access to all other FERC meetings, such as the 
 California Wholesale Conference.   We need to have Real Video access in order 
 to view the meetings.
