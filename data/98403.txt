 Otherwise the letter looks good. I am still waiting on Management so don't

 David asked that I remove the two sentences in the generating section that
 dealt with where Portland General sells its power and whether the ISO and PX
 would have all the transactions.  Otherwise he agrees with the 11:03 a.m.

 Thanks
