 I don't need the advice thanks (but Justin might)
 
 
    
  
 Paul,
 
 I just spoke to Brent Hendry who worked on the Bermuda law advice, and he 
 said he sent you the name of counsel.  I will also sent to you tonight a copy 
 of the advice we just got with respect to derivative transactions and online 
 transactions.

 I need to use Bermudean counsel today on a transaction and understand we have 
 recently selected Bermudan counsel re EOL.  Please could you provide me with 
 contact details.
 
 Many thanks and kind regards.
 
 Paul
