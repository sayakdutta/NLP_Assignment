 Aquila Canada Corp. - follow up
 Christiania Bank - need to send for execution
 Ospraie - send revisions

 we use your assistant, we should input data during the regular business day. 
 
 (3) I have Jason helping me on about seven different brokerage arrangements 
 and will soon need appropriate backup to send together with execution 
 copies.  I am keeping dummy files until these are finalized.
