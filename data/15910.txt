 
 The Republicans are currently on the Senate floor arguing (noisily, 
 repeatedly and passionately) that California (and the Senate in particular) 
 is being hypocritical and intellectually dishonest in attacking and 
 investigating private companies and ignoring munis.
 
 One Senator specifically identified prices charged by LADWP and SMUD and 
 compared those prices to Enron's (1/3 to 1/2 less than LADWP and SMUD 
 charged).
 
 Best,
