 ny choice other than to vigorously (and respectfully) 1) decline to offer u=
 p any contracts and 2) assert our view that Karl Wood it is unfair to attem=
 pt to impose any quid pro quo, i.e., forcing folks to waive their due proce=
 ss rights by declining to hand contracts over to Karl.

 Attached is a ruling issued yesterday by Commissioner Wood directing that E=
 SPs and customers file copies of direct access contracts with the Commissio=
 n by December 3.  The contracts will be available to ALL other parties who =
 sign a "suitable" protective order.  The Ordering Paragraphs read as follow=
 :
 
 1.     By December 3, 2001, any party who believes that it has a direct acc=
 ess contract or agreement potentially affected by an order to suspend direc=
 t access as of July 1, 2001 or a date earlier than September 20, 2001, shal=
 l submit a true and correct copy of each of the actual contracts or agreeme=
 nts along with any arguments as to the impact of such an order.  A failure =
 to submit this information for the Commission's consideration will be consi=
 dered a waiver of the arguments related to claims involving the contracts a=
 nd agreements.  Initially, the true and correct copy of each of the actual =
 contracts or agreements shall be filed under seal with the Commission's Doc=
 ket Office and served on Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) Robert Barnett.<?xm=

 2.     Office of Ratepayer Advocates shall work with the parties who have e=
 xecuted direct access contracts or agreements to develop a proposed protect=
 ive order and nondisclosure agreement for Commission staff, which shall be =
 submitted to ALJ Barnett by December 3. =20
 
 3.     The electric service providers and customers who are parties shall w=
 ork with other parties and shall jointly submit a proposed protective order=
  and nondisclosure agreement that will cover parties other than Commission =
 staff by December 11, 2001.=20
 
 4.     Parties' supplemental comments to the comments they filed in respons=
 e to the October 23rd Assigned Commissioner Ruling shall be submitted by Ja=
 nuary 4, 2002.
 
 
 As a preliminary matter, of course, AReM and WPTF do not, in their own name=
 s, have direct access contracts.  However, certain members of AReM and WPTF=
  are direct parties to the proceeding and need to consider what course they=
  wish to take.  The group also needs to consider if they wish to fight this=
  Order on Constitutional or procedural grounds.  I will be considering our =
 options and get back to you with more detail.  However, as a very prelimina=
 ry analysis, it is evident that the Commission does not have jurisdiction o=
 ver either ESPs or the customers they serve.  The request is also particula=
 rly outrageous because of the statements that, "A failure to submit this in=
 formation for the Commission's consideration will be considered a waiver of=
  the arguments related to the claims involving the contracts and agreements=
 " and "Parties to this proceeding may have access to these contracts and ag=
 reements after the appropriate protective order and nondisclosure agreement=
 s are in effect."  The former is a likely denial of due process and the lat=
 ter exposes proprietary contracts and pricing information to ESP competitor=
 s and exposes sensitive pricing information to competitors of energy-depend=
 ent customers. =20

 Your thoughts would be appreciated.  My initial reaction  is that this is t=
 ime for ESPs and customer groups, such as CMTA, ABAG, CLECA, CIU, EPUC, SPU=
 RR, etc., to band together and fight this at multiple levels, from the Gove=
 rnor's Office on down, including in the media.  Your thoughts would be very=
  much appreciated.
