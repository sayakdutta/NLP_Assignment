 Thanks!

 Marie, My plea is for it to be next week.  I'm totally swamped and understaffed this week.

 Legal has been asked to review and approve all confirmation templates currently being used.  We would like to schedule a meeting to discuss the materials we will need for this review.
 
 Will you advise me of your availability in the next few days so that we can schedule a meeting?  (Diane, I realize we will have to work around the one hour time difference between Houston and Calgary.)
 
 Thanks!
