 FYI.  Oglethorpe (OPC) is inquiring about buying some daily calls for next May-Jul.  I'm already working with Harry/Steve, but thought you would like the reason for the request.  OPC is building a 440MW merchant plant scheduled to be online in June'02.  OPC is looking to buy these calls to hedge against a late online date (suggesting they have already sold at least some of this planned new generation).
