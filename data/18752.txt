 
 FYI. Great news.  PUC "fixed" the language glitches in the original decision 
 granting ETI its certificate and voted it out yesterday.  So we're good to go 
 on filing our final tariff.  It's attached.  Please take a look and let's 
 discuss ASAP (Monday?) so we can get if on file at the CPUC.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Jeff:
 
 Attached is the latest version of the draft revised tariff(s) to file
 when ETI gets final full approval.
 
 The revisions are in redline (red and/or blue) per your request.
 
 Let me know any issues.  Steve will be back in town Friday.
