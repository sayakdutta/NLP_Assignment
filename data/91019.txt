 
 Kirk,
 
 I know I have been slow on this project and will work on getting all needed info to the
 accenture group so that this project can be done.
 I am meeting with Monica and Laura this week and will get all needed info turned in to them
 ASAP.

 Here are my comments on Options (See attachment below).
 
 We need examples of:
 Cap (Call Option)
 Floor
 Collar
 
 In addition we need information on Financial option.
 
 
 Accenture, in all the documents can we have roll over capabilities on the bold words and instead of Click here because time is of essence in our culture and having the learner have to go to the glossary or click for a pop up creates opportunities for disengagement.
