 
 Employees' performance will be evaluated at year end and feedback will be given to employees, but the PRC process itself and all of the many meetings that normally take place will be pared down significantly.  We want to give constructive feedback to employees while making sure that the majority of our time is focused on managing Enron's business.  HR should be sending information out soon to all employees on the details.  
 
 The year-end bonus process is on track at this point, and it is the company's intent to pay bonuses.  It is also the company's intent to follow the process that we go through annually to review compensation levels relative to individual performance and to market data.  That process is slated for February, and at this point I am not aware of any anticipated changes to that.  
 
 I am happy to answer your questions.  Feel free to send me others as the come up.  --Sally  
 
  
     
 Good Morning Ms. Beck,
 
 Could you please tell me if we will be receiving reviews, bonuses, or raises?  That question remains unanswered.  Sorry,  I know you have probably received millions of emails in regards to this question.  
 
 Thank you,
 Cella
