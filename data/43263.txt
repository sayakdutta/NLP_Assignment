 Hi Stan/Jim,
  
 I have a quick question to ask - perhaps it seems self-evident to you and if so, I apologize, but it's so sensitive that I prefer to have clear guidance on this.
  
 With all that is going on with Enron (specifically the debt/liquidity related issues), I would like to know if our actions to pursue the best interest of the company in DR, Panama, Gaza and/or any country which has issues with either cash or debt, should be at all influenced by current events.  Jim, I have asked this question before (of Panama and DR) but things were never so delicate.  Pls. let me know.
 Thanks, Mariella
