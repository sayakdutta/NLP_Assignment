 
 Art,
 
 We can price this up for you but I have a couple of questions -
 
 1)  Is this physical or financial
 2)  Is is a daily call or monthly call
 3)  Would you like this priced at the money or $.50, $1.00 or more out of the money?  I other words, what do you want your cap to be?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kim
 
 ps  What is the schedule for the baloon fest the 10th - 12th?  I'm trying to work around some meetings etc.
 
  
     
 
 Kim, just for planning purposes, what would it cost to have a call option 
 for year 2002 and for 3rd quarter of 2002 for 5,000 mmBtu's per day 
 from the San Juan basin? 
 Thanks
