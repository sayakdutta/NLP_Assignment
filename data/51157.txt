 I think it's very important.
 It is important that our work area looks neat.

 Hello Vince ,
 Vince , before I get with Delores on the matter of the
 department I wanted to ask you how important it
  that we get the walls repaired ?
 Is the Research Department satisfactory or is
 there anything else that i can do ?
 
                          Thanks
                         Kevin Moore
