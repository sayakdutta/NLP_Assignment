 We received the attached from Sullivan & Cromwell re the FX business and the 
 possibilities of using a US companyn which company to use for contract 
 purposes. At a meeting here at MG today, the consensus/preference was not to 
 use a UK company as we have no full ISD (chapter 10) firm nor the wish to 
 change MG's status.
 
 Per the advice from S&C, we like the idea of using a US corporation with a UK 
 "arranger" to cover any UK regulatory issues that arise. Dependent on where 
 the business will end up (I understand to be discussed by Gary Hickerson/Mike 
 Hutchinson 18th August), the following appears to be the among the logical 
 solutions:
 
 1. Contractual entity - either Enron North America, MG London Inc or Newco 
 Inc.
 2. Arranger - either EEFT Ltd, Metallgesellschaft Ltd or MG Brokers Ltd 
 (depending on the effect on their chapter 3 status for the last two).
 
 The current customer base consists of entities in the US, Canada, France, UK 
 and Switzerland.
 
 Please advise on any group/tax issues that can affect the final decision. If 
 you need any further information, please let me know.
 
 Many thanks.
