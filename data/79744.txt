 The EGM Final PRC Meetings have been scheduled for June 25th, 26th and 27th 
 (it has not been determined which of these are trading, other commercial and 
 commercial support).  Please mark your calendars for these dates and assure 
 that any of your direct reports who should attend have the dates as well.  
 All employees (including A&A's) with the exception of Administrative staff 
 should be pre-rated before attending the final meetings.
 
 If you are interested in having HR facilitate a pre-PRC meeting for your 
 business, please contact the EGM HR Associate, Khymberly Booth at ext. 36019 
 for scheduling.
 
 Thanks,
