 
 We are working very diligently to accommodate the need for space on the 30th 
 floor.  Unfortunately, we are not able to do any major construction to 
 densify the floor during the next several months while Enron Property 
 Services is completing the build-out of levels 29, 31 and 32.   In the mean 
 time, we are going to build out the window spaces on 30 to increase the 
 capacity on the floor.  While these locations are not prime spots, people 
 will need to occupy them as our business continues to grow.  Once the window 
 seats have been constructed (estimated to be 2-3 weeks), we will realign 
 groups on the floor and people will need to move once again.
 
 I am requesting your cooperation and patience to work with Lisa Cousino while 
 she works with space planners to coordinate the location of Energy Operations 
 personnel on the newly-constructed Commercial floors.  Susan Harrison is 
 working with Lisa to manage the space planning on 30 during this transition 
 period.  Chantelle Villanueva will be coordinating all moves of people and 
 equipment on the 30th floor.  If there are any problems once a move has 
 occurred (i.e., missing or non-working phones, boxes, computer equipment, 
 printers, etc.), please contact Chantelle at Ext. 3-6279 as she will also 
 coordinate the follow-up on all move-related items.  If Chantelle is not 
 available, Maria Sandoval will be her backup.  Maria can be reached at Ext. 
 3-5586.
 
 I would also appreciate your help in cleaning up the floor, including the 
 window spaces.  We can no longer maintain unnecessary boxes, paper and 
 supplies on the floor.  Please coordinate with your assistant to have your 
 area cleaned up by December 31.  During this clean-up process, if you have 
 any documents that need to be filed and/or archived, please contact Carolyn 
 Gilley in the Information and Records Management group at Ext. 3-5237 and she 
 will make arrangements to pick up the information from the 30th floor.
 
 Thank you in advance for your understanding and cooperation in maintaining a 
 neat and professional work environment.  Between now and the summer of 2001 
 when we will relocate to the new building, please keep in mind that we are 
 all working in a temporary and makeshift environment.  I would greatly 
 appreciate your patience and good humor as we struggle to use the available 
 space effectively.
 
 If I have missed anyone on the distribution list that has just recently moved 
 to the 3oth floor, please forward this message to them.
