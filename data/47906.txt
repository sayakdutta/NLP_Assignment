 also in the queue for approval.  We had previously had them approved for all 
 power, and Credit had shut them down for power because Credit has been 
 worried about their financial condition ala PG&E, but now is willing to open 
 them up for all power.  I thought it was OK to open them up for all power 
 since we had them open for all power before, but I just wanted to run it by 
 you just in case...
