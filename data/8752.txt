 and above within EGM from Chantelle, and used that for the distribution 
 list.  Her list omitted Clara.  All lists that I requested from EGM, ENA and 
 EIM were to have also included those being promoted to manager as a result of 
 our year-end PRC process.  I don't think that I got consistent info from 
 everyone, so I am rechecking names right now and will send Clara a message 
 about the meeting as I also clean up any others that were left off of lists.  
 Thanks for catching this.  --Sally

 Thanks Sheilla

 Please join me on Thursday, January 11 from 1:00 to 4:00 pm for a special 
 information session for the Operations Management teams supporting Enron 
 Americas, Enron Global Markets and Enron Industrial Markets.   We will focus 
 on assessing, managing and mitigating operational risk.  Details on the 
 location for the meeting will be sent to you early next week.  
 
 I look forward to seeing everyone at this meeting on the 11th.  The things 
 that we will discuss will be important for each and every one of you as you 
 carry out your roles in 2001.  I hope that you will make every effort to 
 attend.  Please let me know as soon as possible if you have a conflict that 
 will keep you from attending the meeting.
