 Dear Mark,
 Just received confirmation that the other Mark Taylor from London has left 
 Enron. Hence the letter must be for you. As per your instruction, I opened 
 the said letter and found that it's a bill from them - Crawford Bayley & Co - 
 asking for payment (re: derivative).
 Kindly advise if you want me to fax the letter to you or if you prefer it to 
 be mailed / couriered over. Appreciate if you could furnish me with your fax 
 and RC numbers as well.
 
 Thanks,
 Dorice.
