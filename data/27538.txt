 These look good to me. My only question relates to Susan Scott and the 
 suggestion that she sometimes bends over too far to satisfy her clients and 
 thus might lose here effectiveness as the lawyer. This point is not 
 mentioned. If you plan to cover this in the sitdown that is fine. I think it 
 is a point that deserves mentioning to her.
