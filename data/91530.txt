 gotcha.  hood river would be a sweet place to live for awhile.  
 
 alberta's great.  getting very cold here, but it's been puking in the mountains, so i'm looking forward
 to getting out skiing, etc.  with the nosedive enron is taking, it's easy to blow out of work and head
 to banff.  
 
 alberta just built a 40MW wind farm (doubling wind capacity in the region) with more on the way.  should
 be over 1% of installed capacity for the region soon.  
 
 have fun in mejico.  
 
  
     
 nope, I figure you've been busy, and I haven't actually had time to start
 working on it.  I am heading down to mexico in a couple of weeks to
 interview on a wind/solar/eco-design project down there. Relocation to
 P-town tentatively planned for next summer. There are a number of
 interesting projects on windpower in the hood river region that I am
 investigating.  we'll see how that works out.
 
 how'z alberta?

 >    Background
 >    CESiaK is located on the Caribbean Coast of Mexico, near the Mayan Ruins
 >    of Tulum, south of Cancun. Still under development, the center is a
 >    small
 >    ecotourism and education center that will serve as a model for
 >    sustainable
 >    development in sensitive tropical ecosystems. The revenue generated
 >    through tours and various on-site activities is used to fund
 >    conservation
 >    and education programs within the Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve. The
 >    Center
 >    operates using ecologically responsible technologies, including systems
 >    for wetland waste management, rainwater collection, and solar and wind
 >    energy generation. It also focuses on community development, educational
 >    outreach programs, turtle conservation programs, and biological
 >    research,
 >    including propagation and  revegetation of native plants. CESiaK
 >    provides
 >    a model for other sustainable development projects as well as an
 >    informational resource for the Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve.
 >
 >    Eco-Tourism Guide Position
 >    At CESiaK we currently offer an all-day, educational, sight-seeing boat
 >    tour through the Sian Ka'an Biosphere Reserve and a shorter sunset tour
 >    emphasizing bird-watching.
 >
 >    Highlights of the Tour include:
 >    ? Following the Mayan trade route used 1200 years ago
 >    ? Seeing abundant flora and fauna unique to Sian Ka'an
 >    ? Visiting unexcavated Mayan ruins hidden within the Reserve
 >    ? Floating down a freshwater river and swimming in natural sink-holes
 >    ? Learning the natural and Mayan history of the Reserve with experienced
 >    guides
 >
 >    The primary responsibility of the tour guide is to lead these tours and
 >    educate tourists about the unique diversity of ecosystems, flora, and
 >    fauna found within the Reserve. Other responsibilities include preparing
 >    food coolers for the tours, communicating problems with tour equipment,
 >    and driving and maintaining the two tour vans. Depending on
 >    qualifications
 >    and interest, the guide would also work with other staff members to
 >    carry
 >    out other programs undertaken by CESiaK.
 >
 >
 >    Qualifications
 >    The ideal candidate would have an undergraduate or graduate degree in
 >    biology or environmental science, as well as an interest and
 >    understanding
 >    of general socio-economic issues of Latin America, including Mayan
 >    culture
 >    and history. However, all candidates with a strong interest in learning
 >    will certainly be considered. Once hired, the guide will be thoroughly
 >    trained to lead the tours. Because in many senses the tour guide is the
 >    face of the organization, it is crucial to have proven exemplary
 >    communication skills, command of the Spanish language, an independent
 >    motivation to self-manage the broad responsibilities of the tours, and a
 >    dedication to conservation.
