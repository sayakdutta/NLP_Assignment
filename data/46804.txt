 
 Mr. Harrell,
 
 Thanks for the lovely note about the execution rate.  When we had a big group 
 meeting a few months ago we (Legal) were actually surprised by our success 
 level at that time, but these numbers exceed our expectations.
 
 Since you congratulated Credit, I took it upon myself to also email the 
 message to Credit. too..
