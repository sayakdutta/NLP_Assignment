 Please, prepare for Mulong NG and power price series. 
 We can use  Henry Hub for NG, Cinergy, Cobb and PV for electricity.
  
 We can send him NG price right away. Electricity prices are different: he has to obtain 
 permission from FT (Megawatts Daily). I shall cc you on my msg to him.

 Dear Dr. Kaminski:
 
 I am a PhD Candidate under the supervision of Drs. Richard MacMinn and
 Patrick Brockett. I am now working on my dissertation which is focused on
 the weather derivatives and credit derivatives.
 
 Could you kindly please offer me some real weather data information about
 the price peak or plummet because of the weather conditions?
 
 The past winter of 2000 was very cold nationwide, and there may be a
 significant price jump for natural gas or electricity. Could you
 please offer me some energy price data during that time period?
 
 Your kind assistance will be highly appreciated and have a great day!
 
 Mulong
