 current GTC's are kept, but there have been some changes while you've been 
 gone.  I think Stacy has created  new firm GTC's, and Leslie Hansen has 
 revised the power to change the tax language and also change some of the 
 reps.  I told her to coordinate any changes she might have with David 
 Forster.  Janice has also been revising her forms to deal with some EFP 
 issues.
