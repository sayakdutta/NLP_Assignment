 Hi Daddy.  Well, I read yesterday's Wall  Street Journal but haven't gotten my hands on today's yet.  Those articles  were pretty interesting.  Are there any good ones today?  It's cool to  read the WSJ now compared to freshman year when we used it in economics because  now I really understand the terminology they use!!!  It's a cool  feeling.  Anyway, my day is going well.  I talked to Jennifer this  morning and she said Rose is doing well today and getting better so that's  good.  She was going to try and talk to the vet to see if he'd talked to  the toxicologist at A&M yet so if I hear anything about that I'll let you  know.  I get to register for classes Monday (YIKES!!!!) and have made up my  schedule.  It's all business classes I'm required to take but I'll go over  it with you tonight.  I love you and will call you this evening.  Have  a good day!!
 Love,
 Caron
