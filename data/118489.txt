 Q1: Did you write your web page internally or use an outside company?
 
 A: Enron used an outside company for the web page coding, but the internal 
 applications which our traders use for posting their bids and offers were 
 built by Enron personnel.
 
 
 Q2: What is the name of the outside agency which Enron used for web page 
 development and how can we contact them?
 
 A: The company which wrote the internet software for EnronOnline is 
 Agency.com. 
 
 
 Q3: Are you satisfied with Agency's performance?

 OK - Q1 and Q3 obviously only need internal approval, but I will send Q2 to 
 Agency, if you approve.

 If someone calls the Call Centre and asks if we used an outside vendor for 
 the website, and who the vendor is, shall we tell them?
 
 We have received such a query - I want to establish policy.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Dave
