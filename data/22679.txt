 Done, Larry and his team fully understands the importance. They are working 
 on tuning the machines. Hopefully not more thana couple of days. Joe

 Joe, I would appreciate a quick call by you to Larry to ensure that his 
 organization is focused to get these plants over the goal line ASAP.  We 
 still have technical issues with the vendor that need to be addressed.  I 
 believe EE&CC is working the issues; however, a phone call from you to 
 emphasize the importance to Enron will add extra encouragement.
 
 Thanks.
 
 Regards
 Delainey

 Guys, I understand that none of the facilities were available today - I 
 thought we were targeting 750 MW.  What is the updated availability schedule 
 for each unit?  We are only a couple of weeks from June 1.  Please advise.
 
 Regards
 Delainey
