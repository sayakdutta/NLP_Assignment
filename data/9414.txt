 The CAO staff meeting tomorrow November 21 will be in 49C1 at 8:30.   This is 
 a new location for this meeting. 
 
 Many of you have said that this is not on your calendar.  It has been a year 
 since we started these meeting and if it was placed on the calendar for 1 
 year it has fallen off. 
 
 
 Everyother week at 8:30 on Tuesday.   49C1
