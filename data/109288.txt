 Jason:
 
 I was confronted this morning by Mark DiValero and he expressed his concern 
 over ENA's nominations over the last two weeks.  He said that PGL is not 
 staffed to confirm all 4 cycles of the nomination process and that ENA will 
 start to get cut after the 2nd cycle if nominations are not correct.
 
 I told Mark that I would get back with him early next week and let him know 
 why ENA has had to consistently make changes at every nomination cycle.  
 Also, please inform your schedulers of the risk that they are taking if 
 nominations are not correct after the 2nd cycle (especially on weekends!).  
 
 Please talk to your schedulers and let me know why we can't get our 
 nominations correct.  Thanks!!
