 
 Mike,
 
 Here's a revised version of the option agreement.  I changed the shipping 
 dates, quantity (10), Outside Exercise Date, and the amount of the option 
 payment.  I did not change the prices, since I had not discussed this with 
 Ben, and couldn't get the numbers to work.  
 
 Have there been some changes to the data sheets?  It appears to me that there 
 might be a version which reflects the inclusion of the low sound option.  In 
 the last draft we did not include the low sound option because the impact on 
 the load losses had not been agreed, so the prices did not reflect the option.
 
 Please call or email me if you have any questions or comments.
 
 Kay
