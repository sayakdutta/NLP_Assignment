 Enron Net Works has a 40 minute slot at the Management Conference.   I have 
 roughly sketched out the following agenda:
 
 Net Works Businesses  -  20 minutes (Greg/Louise)
 The Fund - 10 minutes (Jeff McMahon)
 Video - 10 minutes 
 
 As a base for the presentation, please could you review (of course please 
 write complete new ones if you want to) the slides incorporated in the 
 presentation attached below (which was the last board presentation done by 
 Greg) and send all updates to Jason by the end of play today.
 
 
 
 Thanks
 
 Louise
 
 ps Please don't forget the slides for the budget too  which I would like 
 tomorrow.
