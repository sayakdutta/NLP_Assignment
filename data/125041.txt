 Mr. Kuehn...
 I like the BridgePort idea, unsure about the Food idea at ZOOP.  What did you have in mind?  Nate Stanton gave me a call today...we could invite him and folks from work...either way I am cool...also bear in mind that my place has no furniture...
 JOY!

 Billy Williams,
 re. Thursday summer solstice,
 1.  I can stop by Bridgeport and get two growlers, and pick up some food at
 spans.
 2.  what time should we start?  I am available ~6:30
 3.  should we invite people from work, or keep it "real".  I am impartial.
 Later,
 Kuehn
