 Great!  If it was just a desk change, I can take care of that very easily!
 
 Thanks!

 508957 - changed offset from -1.5 to -1 on 2/6 per Stephanie Piwetz (verbal 
 Mirant checkout)
 
 All the rest of the deals I entered for Mike Swerzbin yesterday in my deal 
 blotter, which defaults to Short Term California. I noticed immediately after 
 saving the deals that they were under the wrong desk, and changed them to 
 Long Term Northwest in deal entry. Are there other problems with the deals? 
 The only change should be the desk. Please let me know.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate 
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
   
  
 It looks like you made quite a few changes to some deals and I don't see 
 anything in the comment section.  Can you just take a quick look and see if 
 you know what you changed on any of these.  If not, I can look it up in the 
 audit viewer, but it makes things go a lot quicker if we don't have to go 
 into the audit viewer for each deal.
 
 Thanks!
