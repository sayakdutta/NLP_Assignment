 group about the authority issues raised by municipals (governmentals, cities, 
 etc.) entering into financial trades.  Where can I obtain the most recent 
 list of credit people (you know how those credit people are) who deal with 
 financial trading?  Thanks.  Sara
 
 P.S.  the early production payment docs typically conveyed an undivided 90 % 
 interest in the producer's net revenue interest in particular properties.  
 The other 10 % was considered "excess" for purposes of you know what.

 Sara,
 
 According ot Financial Settlements, the City of Dublin transaction that I 
 told you could have some legal risk because it is a municipality, was 
 actually the trigger to a physical transaction.  I asked if they could book 
 this in the system as a Physical Swap so we show no financial exposure.
