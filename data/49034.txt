  volatilities calculation  
 
 Winston, 
 I am sending you the documentation on the new methodology for creating ffvols
 from implied vols. This methodology requires some minimization procedure
 to fit the given vol curve with a smoothing function. I am sending you the
 code I wrote that performs minimization with simulated annealing method from 
 Numerical Recipes.
 
 We might need to discuss some details. Please, let me know if you have 
 questions.
 
 Tanya.
