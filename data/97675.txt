 Richard,
 
 I know two top flight trial lawyers in New York:
 
 Greg Joseph
 Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver, & Jacobson
 One New York Plaza
 New York, New York 10004
 212-859-8584

 
 
 Norm Kleinberg
 Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP
 One Battery Park Plaza
 NY  10004
 212-837-6680

 
 
 In addition, VE has a lateral partner whom I have not met:
 
 James Serota
 VE
 NY
 917-206-8004

 
 Jamie's bio says that his area of practice is antitrust and business
 litigation,particularly concentrated on industries
 that are evolving fromregulation to competition, including electric
 utilities.  It says he chaired the Fuel and Energy Industry Committee of the
 ABA Antitrust Section from 94-97.
 
 When are you in town, so we can have dinner?

 I anticipate that Enron may have some legal issues in New York similar to
 the issues Enron has faced in California.  Can you recommend a top notch
 trial lawyer (similar to yourself) at any firms in New York?
 
 Thanks.
