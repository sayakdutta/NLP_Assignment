 Kay --
 
 I'm sending you some forms to work from on Enron's standard Government 
 Affairs Consulting Services agreement (Marcia Linton will deliver).  Included 
 within this form is language that can be added to discuss the success fee.  
 As we discussed on the phone, my understanding is that the success fee is 
 legal for non-state level activities in Florida.
 
 I am happy to sign these arrangements to move the process forward.  We need 
 to make sure the arrangements indicate the correct primary point of contact 
 (Project Manager) and the right billing person.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Jim
