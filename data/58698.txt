 Rick: During the early performance review, Germain Palmer had been placed in 
 the satisfactory classification because of the need to reach the goals now 
 not being applied by our division. Germain is definately a "strong" and 
 rising employee in this office and I would like to recommend his rating as 
 "strong."
 
 Germain has been a God send this summer and we all greatly value his 
 contribution in Washington.
 
 Thank you for your consideration of this request.
 
 Joe
