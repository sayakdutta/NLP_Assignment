 At the request of Christi, enclosed please find a revised draft of EPMI's 
 response to TVA's recent  letter concerning  EPMI's transmission requests.  
 This letter has been revised from the earlier draft to reflect comments from 
 Kevin and me.  I will call Bill Rust and read the letter to him after all 
 revisions have been made.  Please let me know if you have any comments.  We 
 would like to get the letter out to TVA as soon as possible, preferably this 
 afternoon if possible 
 
 Thanks
