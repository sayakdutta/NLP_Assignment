 would have been able to extract a neg. rate deal for something north of max 
 for a shorter term.  Maybe that shipper demanded the recourse rate.  Weird.  
 By the way--good memo to Shelley on Red Rock.  df
 
 
 
 
 




  
  
 Rumor on the street is that the entire 200 MMcf/d of capacity in the PGT-NW 
 expansion went to one shipper who offered max. rates for 35 years.
