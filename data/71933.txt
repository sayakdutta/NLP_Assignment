 I'll get Kathleen to do it, as she has my current favorite form.  Thanks

 The sale of the cash flow interest is a new deal that I am not working on and 
 I think that the CA that Fred needs is to cover bidders for the purchase of 
 the cash flow interest.  I will get Ed to prepare the CA if you wish.
