 to closing, so they work even though Term Conversion won't occur prior to 
 closing.  We plan on leaving the references as they exist.  Let me know if 
 you have any questions.

 Since theTerm Conversion won't occur prior to closing, will you be deleting 
 the references to it on  3.1(d), 3.1(k), 3.1(n), 3.1(q), and 4.5?  Thanks.  
 Eva.
