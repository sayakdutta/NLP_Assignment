 I just wanted to thank all of you for getting in touch over the past day
 and a half and expressing your concern for my well-being and the well-being
 of my friends here in New York.  At a time of crisis of such a magnitude it
 helped to feel loved even though I am far away from most of you.  I am sure
 I will talk to most of you over the next couple of days if I have not done
 so already.
 
 Thanks again,
 
 Love Jill
