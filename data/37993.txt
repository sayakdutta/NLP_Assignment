 Mike --
 
 I have asked David Wile to research and get back with you on the issues 
 you've documented below.  Any time you are having an issue in the evenings, 
 the quickest method of response is to call 34888, and choose option 5. Leave 
 a vmail and a technician will respond within 20 mintues
 
 Thanks
 Paige

 I tried logging in to corp, but it failed because it prompted for new 
 hardware - a 3COM card?  Should I get a phone number of one of the 
 technicians, so that I may call them from my house when I try to log in.  
 
 Also, the guys set up a hub for my desktop and laptop.  How do I have the 
 laptop share the printer (which is connected to my desktop)?  Do I use 
 Network Neighborhood?
 
 Thanks,
 Mike
