 
 As you have probably observed, power markets have been severely tested this 
 summer.  There are many underlying causes (demand growth driven by a strong 
 economy, failure of regulators to quickly grant applications for new 
 generation, inadequate access to the grid, rate regulation which continues to 
 insulate end users from real time price signals, etc.).  But, the soundbite 
 on these troubles has been that deregulation has led to problems on the 
 grid.  The knee jerk policy response has been price caps and other threats of 
 re-regulation.
 
 At the upcoming advisory council meeting, Ken and I were hoping that the two 
 of you could discuss the issue and help put it in perspective:
 
 How great of a threat is re-regulation.
 How might we respond.
 How likely is this issue to play a significant role in election politics?
