 proceed if we are doing business with someone who has activities in Libya.  
 Your views please.

 Steve,
 
 Itochu Corporation, a Japanese trading company with which we are developing a 
 relationship, is considering reactivating its activities in Libya. They have 
 identified an opportunity to source LNG from Libya for the purposes of 
 importing to Japan, either directly or through an LNG swap.
 
 What is Enron's current policy on dealing with Libya?
 
 kind regards
