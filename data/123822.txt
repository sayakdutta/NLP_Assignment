 John/Louise -
 
 Given that under the current plan, the bank will be trading our interest rate risk,  I doubt we are taking an interest rate trader to Newco.  In order to get the books run we will need an interest rate curve.  
 
 Should I plan on just getting access to Reuters and setting a curve off of LIBOR on my own?
