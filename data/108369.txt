 cases RAC, look at transactions, a VP or higher will sign the Dash.  For Doug 
 to sign the Bahamas option contract, I need to know the premium.  Please 
 contact Brent Price for our DASH.  (Deal approval sheet)

 Jeff,
 
 I'm sorry to bother you with this, but I can't seem to get a straight answer 
 from anyone - when one is signing a contract around here, is there a form you 
 fill out for approval?  In London, everyone fills out a CACS form (Contract A
 uthorisation Control Sheet), and if the deal is > $0.5m, then a DASH is 
 required as well.  Brad seems to think that if a DASH is not required, then 
 the business unit head signs off on the expenditure?  Is there a formalised 
 global-markets process for this, or is this a product-by-product thing?  (in 
 which case, I'll assume LNG has no process, and I'll direct Eric to implement 
 one...)  (Doug Arnell needs to purchase his option for the Bahamas land 
 thing, thus the reason for the question).
 
 fyi, attached is European CACS form. 
 
 Thanks,
 Merritt
