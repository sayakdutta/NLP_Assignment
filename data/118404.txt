 OK - I hate the solution, but don't see any alternatives to the Master <31 
 vs. > 31 day problem.
 
 Elena/Mark: Please coordinate as necessary to reintroduce the <31, >31 day 
 split for U.S. Gas. This means that U.S. Gas Product Types will now be 
 differentiated based on location (Inside/Outside Texas) and tenor (<31/>31 
 days). Please amend the MPS and the database as required. Obviously, we would 
 like for these changes to be accomplished soon, so we can put all this stuff 
 to bed.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Dave
