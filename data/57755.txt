 
 Excerpts by email are fine.  Also, as I mentioned, I am very impressed with 
 your background and accomplishments, but I would like to have you meet a 
 couple of other people in my group before making a final offer.
 Thanks and stay warm!

 Dear Mr. Kean:
 
 Thank you for your call.  I am looking forward to working for you.  I will
 be available as of June 1, 2001.
 
 I will have the writing samples and resume ready for you on Monday, March 1,
 2001.  Should I fax it to you?  Also, my dissertation is quite lengthy.
 Would you like for me to forward you one chapter or just a couple pages?
 
 As discussed, I will be available to come down to Houston between March 30
 and April 6, 2001.  More snow (as in 6 inches) is expected today and
 tomorrow.  I'm only 5'6".  Pretty soon I will be buried in it since it's
 snow upon snow.  HELP!!
 
 I look forward to seeing you again.
 
 Regards,
 
 Amy
