 In the process of interviewing Paul Thomas for a promotion into the AA program, the feedback from some of the interviewers suggests that perhaps he would be more appropriate as an associate rather than an analyst.  He is currently listed as a specialist but has a history of excellent performance and 4-5 years work experience.  Would you be open to considering an associate role for him?
 
 *Note...as a point of reference, you have Eric Saibi and Peter Makkai slotted for analysts.
