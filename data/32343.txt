 Clinton from 430 to 651 please - this should make the total volume = 13,551.  
 Change the supply from Phillips to balance out the transaction.
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
    
 Chris,
 
  I just finished talking with you about a deal that we sold to Clinton Energy 
 Management (Deal #320094).  The volume that we have in our system has a 

 change the volume).  Could you please change this as soon as possible so that 
 I can get a corrected invoice to them?  Let me know if you have any 
 questions.  Thanks...
