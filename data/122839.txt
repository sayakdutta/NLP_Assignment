 Here is how the UT candidates fared at Super Saturday. 9 of 17 got offers (   
 others are coming to future Super Saturdays). This result is obviously 
 disappointing - - -  65% of  the 55 students from all schools got offers.   I 
 will be getting more info on why the other 8 were not well received.  If 
 anyone thinks a manifest injustice or mistake has occurred let me know.  
 Ditto if you think anyone's prior background makes them a candidate for a 
 direct hire - - -i.e., not in the associate program.
      On the "yeses", please let me know who you would like to follow up on 
 and encourage to accept.  We will try to do this by volunteers: more than one 
 per student is OK, and each of you should select one or two. When you talk to 
 them, get their feedback on Super Saturday and the whole process. If anyone 
 wants to call any of the "no's", to commisserate, that's OK too. - - -DLH
