 How is everyone and everything???  I am always being asked about you, how's 
 the baby, etc.  I hope I haven't missed your visit to the office!  I'm just 
 working away (next to Dan Lyons, I might add) in my own little world.  We are 
 getting help soon and I don't know if Mark mentioned anything to you.  Raptor 
 is a "pain" and Mary has undergone trial by fire.  I am counting the days 
 until my vacation (to Marfa and Napa) which begins after the legal conference.
 
 Do you recall Project Marlin?  I think Lance was involved.  My memory is 
 really bad if I worked on this deal.  There's nothing in Lotus Notes 
 (rats!).  
 
 Take care (I'm starting to sound like David Mitchell).
