 		  Agreement
 
 Ann Elizabeth,
 
 Attached is a form of interconnect agreement that was sent to Christi Nicolay 
 of government affairs for her review from a regulatory perspective.  She 
 forwarded it to me for legal review, but am I forwarding it to you since it 
 is connection with one of your projects.  In addition, Herman Manis of 
 accounting and Lisa Bills and Rose Engeldorf of finance need to review these 
 agreements from their acocunting and finance perpsectives.  I am currently in 
 the process of reviewing other forms of interconnect agreements with them and 
 will share with you what I learn from my meetings with them.  As of now, I 
 can say generally that the issues that they tend to modify are: (1) making 
 the interconnect agreement subject to a notice to proceed requirement which 
 we control the issuance of; (2) not having a parent or letter of credit 
 guaranty; (3) broad assignment language; and (4) limited indemnification 
 obligations.

  Agreement  
 
 The agreement they sent was a generic and they are working on a specific 
 agreement for Midway.  If you see significant issues in the generic, perhaps 
 we should not wait until we get the specific agreement but start pushing to 
 negotiate the known issues now.  We have a meeting with the FPL planning 
 group on the 17th but on Monday I'll call and see who we will be negotiating 
 the agreement with.

  Agreement  
 
 I'm not sure. We are trying to copress the 
 engineering/procurement/construction schedule by getting them to start work 
 while we negotiate this agreement.  
 Perhaps if you could review and give us general comments this week.  By then 
 we may be in a better position to tell you when we would need a draft turned.
 
 Does this work for you?
