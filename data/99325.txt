 
 Gareth Bahlmann is doing a big financing and I participated in a California due diligence call last Thurs. w/ the bank's atty, who happens to be Gary Orloff at Bracewell. Gary wanted to see our proof of claim. Can I get a copy?
 
  
     
 SENT ON BEHALF OF LISA MELLENCAMP
 
 Lisa has requested that the proofs of claim that were filed yesterday be Federal Expressed to her overnight.  When these documents are received tomorrow who will I need to distribute copies to?
 
 Thanks.
