 thats really very cute
 and i liked your rhyme to boot
 
 i have tons of time
 with enron in its decline
 
 please wear your underwear
 while you cheer and no not swear
 
 wings would be great
 please do not be late
 
 on another note
 and this is no joke
 
 when is the dralion show
 so that i can plan to go
 
 p ditty d
 
  

  
 So what's with all the rhyme
 Do you have too much time?
 First came the New Home announcement, then the Super Bowl Ditty,
 Maybe it's time we all start calling you P. Diddy!
 Melissa and I will be there
 I may not be wearing underwear
 Do we need to bring anything?
 Some cokes, some chips or maybe some wings?
