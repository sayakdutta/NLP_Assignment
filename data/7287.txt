 
 Today's Associates PRC meeting that was to begin at 1:30 has been cancelled 
 and will be rescheduled for a date yet to be determined.  Both the morning 
 Analyst PRC meeting and the Associates PRC meeting were scheduled for the 
 same location and with Joe Sutton as chair.  The Analysts PRC meeting is 
 apparently running very long, so someone from the program office called to 
 cancel the Associates PRC meeting for this afternoon.  I will let you know as 
 soon as I know a rescheduled date.  
 
 In preparation for today's PRC meeting, I was able to meet in person with 
 most of your supervisors to get input on your job responsiblities, 
 accomplishments and performance.  For those that were unavailable for a 
 meeting, we managed a phone call or at least a series of voice mails to 
 accomplish the same thing.  I also have any materials that you may have 
 provided to your supervisor for the mid-year review process, as well as 
 copies of the internal feedback that was gathered through the PEP system.  
 
 With this delay in the meeting date, I have the time to ask for a copy of 
 your resume.  The PRC process clearly focuses on your performance 
 specifically from January through June 2000.  However, it would be helpful to 
 me in representing you to at least be familiar with your backgrounds.  Please 
 e:mail a copy to me or you can send a hard copy to EB3015.  A couple of you 
 have come by my office to meet with me.  I would also be happy to put a name 
 and face together for others of you or to talk by phone if you are not in 
 Houston.  My extension is 35926.
