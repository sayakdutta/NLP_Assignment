 Here comes the project we've all been waiting for!  Attached below is the 
 headcount worksheet for the 2002 budget.  This data will be used to determine 
 benefits amounts/percentages and insurance coverage.  Note that there are 
 four pages in the workbook to be filled out.  
 
 Please return the spreadsheets to me by June 21st.  If you need any help or 
 have any questions, I'm available at 713-853-3896.
 
 Thanks!
