 Everything is fine. I am quite busy but as always I enjoy reading
 your articles. Always learning something from you.

 Dear Vince:
 
 I trust everything is fine with you. Please disregard the message I
 accidently sent to you. It was meant for the other Vince.
 
 
 Best regards,
 
 
 John H. Herbert
