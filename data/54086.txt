 
 Mike,
 
 What do you think? I see pro's and con's.
 The argument against is that during PRCs people comment
 positively or negatively about a person and this is how
 the word is spread about an employee.
 Tony  could benefit from being in a London PRC.

 Vince,
 
 Would you like to review Tony Hamilton in your PRC meeting?  Currently he is 
 not in our PEP system since he is on the London Payroll, but I can add him 
 with no trouble at all.
 
 Thanks,
 Anne
