 Vasant informed me that you would be helping the quant efforts of Enron 
 Credit, with the first job to be compiling model documentation to be sent to 
 Darrell Duffie. I've attached below a pretty complete set of current docs we 
 have produced, in no particular order:
 
 Nigel's doc on FMC curve generation (he claims it is out of date now though):
 
 FMCMATHS.DOC
 
 My doc on general theory we're using for pricing and default probability 
 generation:
 
 CREDIT PRICING 2.1.DOC
 
 My doc on asset swap calculation (there is one error to correct)
 
 ASSET SWAP DFIS.PDF
 
 My doc on Placement Model (a second version of the model incorporating 
 ratings has yet to be documented)
 
 PLACEMENT MODEL 1.0.1.DOC
 
 George's doc on the neural network placement model:
 
 NEURAL NETWORK 1.0.DOC
 
 My doc on the VAR model used for credit:
 
 VAR MODEL 1.0 .DOC  
 
 and Kirstee's which preceded it:
 
 CREDITVAR2.DOC
 
 Nigel's doc on the portfolio model used for CDOs and basket trades:
 
 SYNTHETICCDOS.DOC
 
 Katherine's doc on correlations:
 
 CORRELATIONS.DOC
 
 
 Let me know if you need any more information about these models and their 
 applications.
 
 Regards
 
 Ben
 
 PS I've had to zip the files up as they were too big:
