 You need to look at any industrial meter that has buyback and swing deals.  Make sure that the base volume is allocated to the base ticket and all other swings go to the other tickets.

 Daren,
 Is there any Industrial meters in particular I need to watch the imbalances since we are close to the end of the month?
 
 Thanks - Julie
