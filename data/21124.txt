 
 Jim, can you send me hard copies - I am having trouble opening these reports.
 
 Any summaries on the RTO filings?

 Attached is a summary and the original reports from FERC Staff on Power 
 Markets (Midwest, Southeast).  
 
 Overall, these are good reports, but we are not sure where FERC will go now 
 (especially with the outstanding Presidential election).  I'll keep you 
 posted if anything begins to move.
 
 Please let me know if you need anything else.
 
 Jim
