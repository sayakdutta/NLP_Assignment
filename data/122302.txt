 
 When do we break bread with Art and Donna?
 
 
     
 
 We have and we like it, too...
 
 Why don't we plan to meet there at 6:30 or 7 p.m. (whatever works for you)?
 Will that give you guys enough time to settle the home front before coming
 back to town?

 Have you all been to Crostini's on Shepherd between Westheimer and Fairview?
 We had a department lunch there before Christmas and it was wonderful.  The
 lobster bisque in a bread bowl was fabulous!  What time should we shoot for?
