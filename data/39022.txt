 
 I forgot to tell you this.  I had a dream a few weeks ago that you called me 
 and said you and Dave were getting married.  Anyway, I was congratulating you 
 and you said that to raise money for the wedding you were going to strip for 
 a couple months and that I should bring my friends down so you would make 
 some extra cash.  So I did and went down there to help you out but got so 
 wierded out by the whole thing that I left.  I don't know why i just 
 remembered that but I thought you would think it was funny.
