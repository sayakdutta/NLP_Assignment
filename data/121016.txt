 
 Steve,
 
 Attached are two copies of the revised ISDA - one is redlined and one is not.  If you are ready for an executable copy, please let me know and I will have them printed out and sent to you.  Sara Shackleton is on vacation this week but Marie Heard is trying to start the process for outside counsil opinion. I will keep you informed as I know more about this.  Please let me know if you have any questions or need anything at all from me.
 
 Thanks!
 
 Kim
