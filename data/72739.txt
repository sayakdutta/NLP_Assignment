 I've talked to Marguerite.  She agreed to a call tomorrow at 2 PM central.
 She is sending to you and me a draft of an extension.  No need to do
 anything with it tonight, but I suspect that Mike will begin calling Ben
 about it in the morning.
 
 
     
 
 Hi there,
 
 I am meeting with Ben tomorrow to discuss NWestern.  I'm fairly confident
 that he will be willing to extend the letter agreement, but he hasn't
 called me back today to confirm.
 
 Ms. Kahn and I have exchanged voice mail.  Could one of you return her call
 for me?  I'm tied up.  You might get an idea on some times tomorrow for a
 call.  I'm booked until around 130 for anything which would last more than
 a few minutes.  I'll check with Ben.
 
 Thank you,
 
 Kay
