 
 Dear Mr. Keffer,
 
 Thank you so much for agreeing to pass my resume along to the appropriate 
 person with the Astros organization. In keeping with our family tradition, I 
 am a huge Astros fan, and would appreciate the opportunity to get a "behind 
 the scenes look" at how a professional sports organization works. 
 
 This should be an exciting season for Houston baseball, and it would be an 
 honor to be a part of it.  Any assistance you can give in putting me in touch 
 with the right person would be appreciated.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Paige Record
