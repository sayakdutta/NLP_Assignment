 Guys,
 
 Attached are the "one-page" background/position statements that I have
 received to date (with the exception of Mike Korpi's which I left at home).
  If you haven't provided me with this material please do so asap and if you
 did please give my any edits you might like to make to the attached pages.
 
 Thanks
 
 john
