 J,
 
 Do you think that if P & J and the kids went to Guam they would consider leaving Jo Lynn with the kids and come on to Hong Kong and join up with us?  
 
 FYI, I still have small reservations about travelling abroad still close to our international situation.  Perhaps fear of the unknown.  Sitting on the fence.  Undecided.

 Judy and I had a wild idea last night.  Since the kids are off the week of
 Thanksgiving we are toying witht the 4 of us going to Guam.
