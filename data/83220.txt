 operations/logistics is superior.  Kathy is able to manage multiple tasks and 
 is able to get performance form her people.  Even with the dramatic growth 
 of  our business, the ops group has been able to manage to sustain a very 
 high level of performance.  I think Kathy could improve in the commercial 
 area (idetifying important data/market info) and thinking of ways to improve 
 our business model though systems, organizational structure, etc..
 
 Ed Terry  SASTIFACTORY/STRONG   Similar comments as above in the area of 
 operations/logistics.  Ed's scope is fairly narrow, very centered to 
 operations/logistics.   I would like Ed to improve his ability/wllingness to 
 make decisions.   Very little commercial understanding, although shows 
 interest in learning.
