 
 I have revised the option form consistent (except where noted) with comments 
 sent by Herman and Lisa, and have attached a redline version.  Herman, I 
 dealt with your comment regarding the defn of Optionee by tinkering a little 
 with the 1st paragraph.  I also construed your comment regarding Enron's 
 right to terminate the option to NOT preclude termination if our counterparty 
 is in default.  Please confirm that this is acceptable.
 
 Lisa, I did not change the notice info since the first entity will the the 
 project co, with ENA Legal receiving a copy.
 
 
 
 Please advise if you have any comments.
