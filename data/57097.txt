 Vince:
 
 Ashley Baxter called and wanted to know if you would be interested in going
 to Cal Berkeley on Monday and giving an overall Enron presentation on
 Monday night to a group of about 700 students.  She said they could do it,
 but thought you might want to.
 
 Let me or her know.
 
 Thanks!
 
 Shirley
