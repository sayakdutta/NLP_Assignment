 You asked for a time line on securing this quote.  
 
 I have already discussed the general concept with Marsh Mac and a bit of strategy on how we would approach this with AIG.  
 
 Lou,  I need you to give me the data that we have available on these lines.  As I mentioned to you, I want to go to the carrier  with what I have to offer them instead of them dictating to me what they want.   Until I get this I am strictly talking in a vacuum and can get nothing moving forward.  
 
 After that, I would think that I could have a quote from them within 30 days..I will shoot for better than that.  I feel however that this quote/due diligence will be much more intensive on their part  given their experience with EOTT,  I can definitely ask for an answer within a specified time frame.  Is 30 days acceptable? 
 
  Hope this answers your questions.  If not please let me know.
