 acts like a shell agreemtent which I don't understand.

 This contract number appears twice on the Service List in Path Manager with 
 different deal numbers ( 151880 & 156569). Is this duplication in error and 
 should one be killed  ?  The rate schedule is FSS.  I couldn't find demand 
 expense for this contract on the invoice. Is this a pipeline error ? 
 
 Thanks,
 Brenda
