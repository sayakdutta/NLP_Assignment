 Day and his office, that would be immensely helpful.  If not, no worries.  
 Just let me know.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 I assume Jeff is handling the response to the ORA/TURN filing to alter the 
 PG&E tariffs on gas diversions.  Let me know if you need anything from me on 
 that or anything else.  Thanks.
