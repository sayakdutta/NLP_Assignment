 
 Leaf finished his shift at 6 a.m. today - he'll be back at 6 p.m. But I 
 talked to Bill Williams about it and he saw the trade in the Real Time log, 
 and said he remembers hearing Leaf do the trade with Sempra. If you have a 
 number for Harry at Sempra, I'd be glad to give him a call and figure this 
 out. Let me know.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate

 Kate, 
 Deal 567990.01, trader at Sempra, does not show this trade.   Harry from the 
 backoffice called. 
 Please ask Leaf.
 
 Thanks
 Stephanie
