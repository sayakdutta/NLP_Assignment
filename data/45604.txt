 was shut down for physical power.  If you records do not reflect the same, 
 can you shut them down...thanks!

 This list is all amended counterparties, most of them being opened up for 
 financial power.  My records reflect that all of them were already open for 
 financial products, except the three I have marked.  If you run across any 
 others that you show as not being open for financial, let me know, because 
 all of the counterparties on this list are ok for financial.
