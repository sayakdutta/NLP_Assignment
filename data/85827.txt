 Tyrell,
 
 Got your voice message last night  -  please review the attached updated Confirmation (see "OTHER" # 1 & # 6).
 As you mentioned the Master might take some time to be Executed so I recommend we send this Confirmation as is.
 Is Gerald Nemec the attorney working on the Master ? If he is I'll make sure he incorporates this GTC into the Master.
