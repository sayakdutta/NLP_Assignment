 
 Here is the e-mail we received from ISDA.  Since we only have $500 left and 
 they are suggesting $1000 for the lunch, I'm not sure it makes sense to send 
 someone.  I've left a voice-mail for Stacey to ask where they stand and 
 whether or not they still want us to send someone.

 Hello Mark and Mark -- Any chance of Enron contributing to the Lugar event
 on Monday, March 27th?  If so, are either of you available to come to D.C.
 for the event?  I think it owuld be great to have you there particularly
 since we still need to nail down treatment of energy products.
 
 I have attached event details.  Thanks!
