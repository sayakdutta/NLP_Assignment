 
 My only concern is the 8 hours out of date reference.  As of when?  It might 
 not be 8 hours old when they go to press so do we mean when it is being 
 read?  Would it hurt to say something to the effect of "By the time you read 
 this" as a lead in?  Are we sure that even this is accurate?  How long from 
 press run til the first copy hits the street?

 Please provide approval of the following ads for Global editions of the Wall 
 Street Journal and Financial Times.  We are going to remove mention of 
 EnronOnline being the only website in the world to reach $100 billion in 
 eight months from the ad text.  The rest of the ad copy will stay as is.  We 
 plan to run sometime beginning in September.
 
 Thanks
