 
 At 10:45 am today, Jan 6th, we sent a notice to TVA advising them that a 
 Triggering Event under the MOPA had occurred.  As a result of the Triggering 
 Event, EPMI has the right to suspend deliveries and/or to terminate the 
 MOPA.  At this point, we have not elected to suspend deliveries or to 
 terminate the MOPA.  Accordingly, our performance under the MOPA at this 
 point will not be impacted and we will continue to perform under the terms of 
 the MOPA. 
 
  The letter also sets forth a proposal to TVA pursuant to which EPMI would be 
 willing to continue performing under the MOPA.  This proposal is conditioned 
 on  TVA allowing EPMI to seek a judicial determination of its rights and  TVA 
 paying market-based rates for the energy delivered by EPMI to TVA under the 
 MOPA  pending the judicial proceedings.
