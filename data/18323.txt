 
 Speaking of cheese, I spoke with Jeff Green last night, and under the 
 circumstances, he'd prefer to do the Dome road next summer (when he's up 
 doing more work on my property.  I agreed (there's a lot more bark from all 
 the wood chopping and that'll get us through till June).  I talked to him 
 about the culvert.  He had some thoughts, which I'll pass along and I'll talk 
 to him about it some more this weekend.
