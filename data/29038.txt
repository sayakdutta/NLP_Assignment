 
 Please see attached notes of the last meeting with PGE on Topock pcb 
 problem.  Lou will be coordinating development of a litigation strategy in 
 case PGE cuts our deliveries below 250 mm/d or pursues decon. of the Topock 
 compressor (with the expectation that we will pay for the work under the 
 operating agreement indemnity).  I volunteered your services, and my own, to 
 assist with this work.  I believe the next step is for Lou to set up a 
 meeting to discuss.  Thanks.  DF
