 James -- real quick -- how many PVMWhs are there in a 4-year 7X24 6.5 MW power sale starting 1/1/02?
 Thx
 
  
     
 I certainly understand your concerns and believe that they should be voiced.  I will also babysit the situation and try to make sure she abides by the rules!
 
  
     
 We should definitely invite Rosie, but she has to promise to stay out of my parents' bedroom!
 
  
     
 El,
 I am in for sure.  Just gotta look into possibly using miles.  I think Suz might be in as well.  What about Rosie?  Let me now the details!
 Thanks for the invite -

 My folks have offered to let us use Chez Stinson for the weekend od Dec 15-16. Do you think you guys can motivate a Houston group to the Bay Area for a few days?
