 
 Tracy, we have already given the plaques to the employees, but I think they would like the case
 as well.  So go ahead and send them to me and I will give them to the employees.  Thanks. Lynn
 
 
    
  
 Lynn:
 
 I sent service award plaques to you Friday, June 1, for Diana Porter and Karen Clapper.
 The plaques should have been enclosed in a presentation case.
 However, O.C. Tanner did not include the presentation cases in their packaging of the service awards.
 
 The presentation cases should be delivered to me this week.
 
 If you would like to hold off on the presentations, I will forward the cases to you
 as soon as they are received from O.C. Tanner.
 
 I apologize for this inconvenience.
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
 Thanks,
 Tracy Scott
