 Dan,
 
 This looks fine, so if you would like to have your people execute it and
 forward it to us, we will execute and close the loop.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Tammi
 
 

  
 
 
 Attached please find a red-line and clean version of the Confidential
 Agreement we discussed this morning.  Please advise if the clean version is
 in order and I will have the Credit Group proceed with its execution and
 forwarding to Gibson.
