 
 Kristin,
 
 The problem with this guy is that we maxed out on the number of interns we
 can gainfully employ and provide adequate supervision. So, we have to pass on 
 him.

 I hear that you have been in contact with this student.  Do you have any 
 interest in hiring him for a summer position?  If not please just let me know 
 and I will call him to let him know.
 
 Regards,
 Kristin

 Dear Ms. Gandy:
 
 Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule to visit the Owen
 Graduate School of Management at Vanderbilt on January 23-24 for on-campus
 interviews for the Summer Associate positions at Enron. It was a pleasure
 talking with you, and I hope I conveyed to you how excited I am about the
 prospect of applying my skills at Enron.
 
 I realize that Enron offers a limited number of positions and greatly
 respect your choice of Summer Associates. I would like to ask you if there
 is any opportunity for me to work at Enron during this summer for free. I am
 confident that my sincere interest in derivatives will allow me to greatly
 contribute to Enron during this summer. I am particularly interested in
 Enron Research Group. (I had a phone interview with Mr. Gibner on January
 31st, and I sent him email yesterday asking for the opportunity to work for
 free during this summer).
 
 I am looking forward to hearing from you. If I can provide more information
 or answer additional questions, please feel free to contact me either by
 telephone (615-496-1132) or via e-mail

 to Houston for additional interviews.
 
 Again, thank you for your time and consideration.
 
 Sincerely,
 Dmitri Villevald
 OWEN MBA 2002
