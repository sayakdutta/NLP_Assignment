 
 Irene:  Due to the lateness of  discussions at Enron Capital & Trade 
 Resources Corp., I did not send any documents to you this evening.  However, 
 I do have two different sets of drafts to send to you in the morning.  I have 
 an ISDA without an annex (collateral built into the Schedule) and an ISDA 
 with an annex.  We have had discussions regarding the use of Letters of 
 Credit and Surety Bonds as acceptable forms of collateral and I may need some 
 additional time to resolve the issues.  
 
 I will contact you early tomorrow to deliver docs and establish a timeline 
 (if possible).  Thanks.  Sara
