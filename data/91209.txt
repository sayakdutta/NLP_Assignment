 don't we still have nine holes left at texas national?  and if so (and they have not expired),  why not try and head out there next weekend or something?  if not just a regular round somewhere else.  i'd be apt to go somewhere else besides brock and stuff.  i heard there are some pretty decent courses that are not too expensive if you dive out 20 minutes or so.  ernie said there's a course out in the baytown area that's not too bad.  let me know what you think.  i hope that everything is working itself out for you.  i know it's cheezy but i'm here for you.
