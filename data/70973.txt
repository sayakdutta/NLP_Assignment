 Lisa:
 
 Ken Raber (electricities) and I discussed the option agreement yesterday and 
 came to the conclusion that any issues electricities has with the option 
 agreement will go to you directly.  I believe that will streamline the 
 process.
 
 The attorney's name is Mike Colo and his telephone number is 252-972-7105.
 
 I would really like to get this option agreement signed as soon as we can and 
 I'm sure you feel the same!
 
 If there is anything I can do let me know.
 
 Jeffrey
