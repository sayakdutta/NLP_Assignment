 on ensuring that action items from consolidated audits are completed prior to 
 the action item completion date, I really need to know how Scott and I are to 
 proceed on the subsurface drilling activities for potential contamination at 
 the Bakersfield Fractionator.  The scheduled completion date for six of the 
 items is 6/30.  I understand the there is an issue concerning Koch's 
 individual and shared responsibility for some of the issues identified during 
 the audit.  Rich Jolly has contacted me asking me when the drilling will 
 begin, as he does not want to see us exceed the 6/30 date and have the items 
 show up as deliquent in his region.  Whatever you can do to assist us in 
 either initiating the investigations or placing a hold on the drilling would 
 be greatly appreciated.
