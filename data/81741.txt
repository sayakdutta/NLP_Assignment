 I just left you a voicemail regarding the natsource study.  We have been able 
 to pull in the basis and price curves, but we are having trouble getting the 
 gas daily curves for June to come in correctly.  I.T. is looking into this 
 issue and will have us an answer soon.  Email me and let me know where I can 
 save a file out to you with the curves we do have.  The file is too large to 
 Email.
 
 Thank you,
