 invitations.  --Sally 
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
    
 The 30th of July works great for me.  The interns should still be around and 
 it would be a great way to end the summer.  I will put
 a list together of recent graduates and send that to you.  I will also 
 contact Shelly Jones and get a list of those starting in July.  I think 
 it would be a good idea to include  friends/dates.  There are not that many 
 of us Sooners here and we have met  most of our friends 
 at Enron.  Let me know of anything else I can do.
 
 Thanks Again,
 Jody
