 
 We have an agreement which resides in TurboPark.  Kathy Clark did the 
 contract.
 
 
    
  
 Kay:  Brice Golden insists that he has learned about the existance of a 
 Purchase Agreement in place under which projects such as his for Ft Pierce 
 can add their order for Transformers, without having to negotiate a stand 
 alone contract.  Sort of an ala carte arrangement.  I have asked Sheila Tweed 
 what she knew about this, and she said she had nothing, but did not know what 
 you might have done.  I know we have done bulk purchases and later split for 
 the different peaker  projects, and some others similar to that, but no 
 blanket agreement.  What have you got?
