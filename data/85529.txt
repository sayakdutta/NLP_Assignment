 
 I have reviewed the Oneok Westex Transmission Agreement.  The only comment I 
 have is that the daily balance cashout requirements in Section F of the 
 General Terms and Conditions seem very burdensome.  This is really a business 
 call, but the 5% tolerance or cashout everyday might be difficult to 
 maintain.  I will leave that to you to decide Stacey.  I am OK with 
 everything else.
