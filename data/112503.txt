 Marianne,
 
 I received your faxes. Thank you. I think the right person to contact on filing the Commission Order will be Rebecca Fite. Her group is responsible for license related EES filings. As the filing is past due, it may make sense to send fax copies to the parties today prior to filing.
 
 Thanks,
 Gloria

 Jim:  FYI -- I spoke with Craig Shields (who replaced Beth Goodman on license application preparation) and he was aware of a "letter" that was sent to the VA commission requesting that our gas pilot license be converted to a permanent gas supply license.  He said "someone here reviewed it" and that it was "very short."  I have asked for a copy of what was sent.  I'll keep you posted... MLC
