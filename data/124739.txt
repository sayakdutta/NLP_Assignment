 I will only be in Albuquerque for like 4 hours Monday morning...so it doesn't look like I will have to much of a chance to meet up with you. Maybe an early afternoon brew...
 Emily Willis--huh--didn't you and her...oh yeah...I remember the flat tire.
 
 
     
 
 Dude,
 
 I was looking around on "classmates.com" and found out that Ryan Leppert
 married Emily Willis.  Remember Emily Willis? We got a flat tire in the
 pouring down rain coming home from her house one night?
