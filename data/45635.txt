 broadband masters potentially close to signature. However, I was a little 
 cheered up when I got back and checked with the Swap Group and found out we 
 have 13 masters out for signatures right now.  It still may be hard to beat 
 you at your going rate...but, all I have to say is we're still in the 
 game...GO TEAM!!!
