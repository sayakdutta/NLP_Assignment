 We had the best time.  Good friends, great experiences, weather , etc.  Now 
 we all want to move to  Denver.  I am glad that Bens outfit worked out so 
 well.
 I thought it was cute and I could picture him wearing it when I purchased 
 it.  So-------are you still planning the retreat weekend?  I am soooo 
 jealous.  I would love to go but as I said I can not justify the expense.  
 Any consideration to something a little more modestly priced?  Do you already 
 have the plans made?  
 Call me or write me back.   Hey - I am getting more and more excited about 
 NYC.
