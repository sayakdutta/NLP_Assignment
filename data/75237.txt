 
 Hi Mark,
 
 I don't know  what these folks are up to.  In fact, I didn't know that Scott 
 Laidlaw was involved.  When I spoke with EECC I told them that they needed to 
 get direction from you, someone from Mike Coleman's group, or an ENA 
 developer.  
 
 Any word from the Co Op/PB team?
 
 I have jury duty in just a little while, so I'll be out of touch for a short 
 while.
 
 Kay
