 Sara and Stephanie -
 
 I got a call this morning from Todd Gibson at Merrill Lynch International 
 Bank, following up on the status of our $150 MM guaranty.
 
 Can you please give me a call sometime today and let me know where we are on 
 this?  I want to give him a call back to advise on status.
 
 
 Thanks,
 
 Jay
