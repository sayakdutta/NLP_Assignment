 Rockets game tonight.  I was hoping I could get cell phone numbers from a few 
 of you so that I could maybe meet up with y'all after the game.  I definitely 
 want to see everyone and could "go out" later if anyone's interested.

 Hey girls,
 
 I'm back from London (the trip was incredible) and would love to see all of
