 In a hearing off the Floor this afternoon, the Assembly Appropriations 
 Committee voted on a partisan basis (14-7) to pass AB 81 (Migden), which 
 would make power plants state-assessed.  Please note that two amendments were 
 adopted by the author:  (1) allocate property tax revenues derivbed from 
 state-assessed property according to the same formula used by county 
 assessors "in order to hold local agencies harmless."  (2) Exempt 
 qualififying facilities from the bill "because QFs have never been subject to 
 state assessment."  The bill will be on the Floor for Thursday morning's 
 session.
