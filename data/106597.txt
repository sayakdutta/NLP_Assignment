   Agreement
 
 Attached please find latest versions of the above referenced agreements, 
 marked to show changes from drafts distributed yesterday. It is my 
 understanding there are no open commercial issues in the agreements, and the 
 majority of the reflected changes have been discussed and agreed to by all 
 parties , subject to their approval of the verbiage, except West LB and the 
 accountants. The letter of credit and form of parent company guaranty are 
 expected to be received tomorrow from counsel to CCSI, and I will forward 
 them along as soon as they are received.If there are any other comments or 
 questions about the documents please let me know. I'm in all day Friday and 
 can be reached over the weekend at home 713-266-4715 or work 713-853-6119 
 (please leave message and number where I can call you back).
 
 Matt and Roger: Please forward the attached to any parties with whom you are 
 working that are required to review and approve the form of documents not 
 already reflected in the distribution.  Roger: I received your telephonic 
 comments and those changes had been made. Thanks for the heads up.
