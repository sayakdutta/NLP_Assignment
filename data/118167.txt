 Mark, I apologize for not having responded sooner, however I have been in and 
 out of the office and did not see your email until yesterday.  Let me know if 
 you still need me to fill out David's performance review.
 
 Thanks
 John 
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
    
 My apologies for the late notice in requesting your performance review for 
 David Portz.  He was incorrectly listed in the system as an employee under my 
 supervision and I didn't see his suggested reviewer list until today.
