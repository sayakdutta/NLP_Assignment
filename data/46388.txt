 
 We are in the process of filing our annual hedge exemptions with the NYMEX 
 for 1999.  In connection therewith, I will need to provide the NYMEX with an 
 updated copy of the alphabetical list of Enron Corp. and Subsidiary 
 Companies.  My last list was dated June 8, 1998.
 
 Thanks Kate, as usual, for your help!
