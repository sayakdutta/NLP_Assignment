      Hi Sara,
 
      Since Enron prepared the ISDA Master Agreement referenced above, we do
      not have an electronic version on file.  Could you arrange to forward
      to me via e-mail the "Schedule 1" Irrevocable Transferable Standby
      Letter of Credit Format?
 
      Thank you for your assistance and I look forward to receiving it.
 
      Regards,
      Marty Oelmann
