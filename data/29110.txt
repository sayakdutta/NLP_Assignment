 dummies.  Next time someone calls and gives me a special deal thats only 
 available for a limited time, I'll jump on it!   Kevin, please let me know 
 what Steve, Bill, and Stan ultimately decide to do on this.  Thanks. DF

 Now given the close of business today and the concern regarding price movement
 since Monday I have requested new pricing information again.  The appearance 
 is
 that the numbers have moved.  I suspect that we have missed the upward price 
 movement
 associated with the "Winter of 2000" the last few days.  
 
 I hope we can get a defined process to capture a short term price movement or 
 we may 
 be faced with gas prices between March and April (which is the in-service 
 targeted) that 
 we don't even want to mention.  
 
 Let me know.
