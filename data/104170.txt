 When you get a chance, let's discuss this. Thanks.
 
 Also, I wanted to discuss with you the Tokyo Financial Trading business.

 Alan, and Sara,
 We had spoken about a month ago that the Credit and Convertible Books may be 
 moved into Enron North America from ECT Investments Inc..
 Please advise what we need to do to do this.  At the prime Brokers we can 
 move these separate books to the ENA grouping of books.  What do we need to 
 do from a Corporate structure side since ECT Investments, Inc. is a wholly 
 owned sub of ENA at this time?
 
 Enron Credit.com is currently using the ENA entity for deals with US 
 courterparties. 
 
 Thanks, Sheila
