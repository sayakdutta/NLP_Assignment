 
 Here is the ABB contract you referenced in your email.
 
 I am working on a 97-10 compliant EPC contract for NEPCO/EECC.  However, I 
 wonder about the challenges presented with the need for NEPCO to enter into 
 subcontracts and purchase orders which preserve the accounting treatment all 
 the way down the line. This is a very tall order given the contracting 
 environment.
 
 Your email is an excellent description of the challenges of doing a deal off 
 the balance sheet, and worthy of further discussion.

 Hi Paul,
 
 This will need the same facilities agreement treatment as the GE contract we 
 are working on.
 
 Thanks,
