 OK, wondering why there ain't no charges on your credit card from our 
 FABULOUS trip to Squaw Valley?  I just found out that they're all on 
 mine!!?!?!?   I had the best time up there, but I couldn't figure out how it 
 coulda cost $1700.  Just called them to inquire.  They said:  There's no 
 mistake those are all the carges for rooms 432 and 450.  They're sending 
 receipts.  Unreal.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
