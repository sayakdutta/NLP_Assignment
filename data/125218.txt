 
 According to CNBC, the Dynegy deal is close, with an announcement today.
 I'm not really nervous; Enron's strength is its wholesale trading dept. 
 I'm not sure about non-core business and corporate hacks, though.
 We'll see how it all shakes out - it's really hard to believe it has come to this.

 So, are people in your area getting nervous? Is everybody looking for jobs
 at other companies? There are only 3 companies left to interview with
 through Duke for Tara. Under normal circumstances she could just contact a
 bunch of other energy companies in Houston and probably get as good an offer
 from one of them, but with thousands of Enron employees flooding the market,
 who knows. Tara found out from a friend of hers at UT that a company called
 Peabody in St. Louis is willing to hire anybody with experience at Enron.
 Sweet Jesus, I could get season tickets!
 
 
     
 
 If there is an Enron next week, she will probably get an offer. Unless we
 are owned by Dynegy.
 Then I don't know. Either way, don't quit cleaning boats yet.
 
     
                 
    Do you still have a job? Tara is hearing some pretty nasty stuff about
    Enron. She's pretty worried that they are gonna renig on their offer.
