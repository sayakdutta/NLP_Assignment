 
 Andrew,
 
 Note conference room for our meeting today.  I'm also attaching a brief 
 writeup of the deal so far from our perspective.  You might want to review 
 before our meeting so you will know where our current understanding (or 
 misunderstanding :-)   )  of the deal currently is.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Charlie
