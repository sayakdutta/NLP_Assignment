 Two issues that we should work on -- First Energy discusses CBM (not sure of their position) and MAPSA deals with ICAP.  My recollection is that ICAP will not be addressed at this time?  Seems to me that we should  try and propose some resolution or at a minimum a separate proceeding to mediate this issue before 1/1/03?  What do you think?  On CBM, now is the time for FERC to get rid of this discriminatory practice.

 Attached is my summary of the requests for rehearing of FERC's July 12, 2001 orders in the Northeastern RTO proceedings.  If you would like any further information, please let me know.
