 
 If Debbie is talking about the language she and I discussed late last week, 
 that is new credit language that has not yet gone in to any of the GTC's.

 Debbie, 
 
 I am not sure which language you are referring to.  Some of the GTC's have 
 language providing for the posting of a letter of credit by the counterparty 
 when the Enron entity makes a request to do so.  Mark Taylor drafted this 
 language.  I assume that it is the same as the financial language.  Please 
 let me know this e-mail does not answer your question.
