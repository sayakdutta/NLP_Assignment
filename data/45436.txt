 
 We've got a draft master with the following rounding conventions:
 
 Short tons: zero decimals
 Temperatures:  zero decimals
 US Dollar Amounts:  to the nearest cent
 
 Do you know whether those are our standard rounding conventions?
 
 P.S.  Do you get a invite to our favorite email person's political
