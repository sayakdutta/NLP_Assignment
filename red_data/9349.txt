 
 Mike & Scott,
 
 Sally asked me to forward this to you & wanted to know if there was any way 
 possible you could attend. I apologize for the short notice, but with Sally 
 going out of the country, things have been really hectic.   Sheila Glover 
 will also be attending. 
 
 Please let me know as soon as possible & I will let Paige know.
 
 Thanks,
 Patti

 You are invited to an Enron Implementation Offsite to discuss FAS 133.  The
