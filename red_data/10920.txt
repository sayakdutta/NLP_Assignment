 
 Jeff,
 I needed to apologize for my inability to handle myself in more of a 
 professional manner.  I thought I had moved on from being an emotional basket 
 case , but as we found out, I haven't..  Again , please accept my apology.  I 
 just need to move forward and stop reflecting on the past.  It is  so  
 difficult when you have given your entire career for an organization that 
 still doesn't see value in you.  But, that is my problem not yours.
 
 In regards to your party , your right, I laughed at the invitation - (It is 
 so Shankman)  - Sorry I will not be able to attend. But thanks for asking.
 
 And lastly, Wes Walton how?  2001 Candy Apple Ferrari !!!
