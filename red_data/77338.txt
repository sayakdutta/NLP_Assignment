 
 Here at Enron the lawyers generate risk memos in connection with 
 transactions, summarizing the more important legal risks in a deal.  I've 
 been taking notes along the way, but I will be asking you for your thoughts 
 here shortly.  A discussion will be all I'm looking for at this time.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
