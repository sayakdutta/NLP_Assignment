 copy to fix the header and page break, so use the copy I sent you.  Thanks 
 for your help!

 Tana:
 
 Please finalize the attached NDA so that we can send to the UK for execution 
 as soon as possible.  When we've received an executed copy, we can send to 
 Robert Harris at the number set forth below.  (If you have a better process 
 in place, go for it.)  We just need to make sure we have a final signed NDA 
 by the end of tomorrow in preparation for a Wed. morning meeting in NY.
 
 When we have received an executed copy from Credit 2B, please be sure to let 
 David Dupre know.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Leslie
