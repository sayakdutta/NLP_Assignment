 
 I glanced at the power product description (what I could see of it) - Is it 
 definately a physical transaction?  where does the power get delivered?  If 
 it really is physical, I'll need to get one of the power trading lawyers to 
 look it over.

 Two new Product Types have been created and require approval. In the 
 DataManager you will find:
 
 US Jet Kero Fin Swap - which you will find in Partialy Approved
 
 and
 
 US West Power Phy Spd - which you will find in Awaiting Approval.
 
 The automated e-mail function associated with the notification of parties 
 when a Product Type is created or approved is not functioning, and we are 
 working to have the problem fixed. In the interim, please approve the Product 
 Types and send me an e-mail when you are done.
 
 As you would expect the respective commercial areas are eager to have these 
 Product Types availabble for trading.
