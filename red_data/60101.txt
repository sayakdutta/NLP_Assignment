 We have Restart/Integration draft plans in place for our business lines as defined below.  I have put the point person next to the function.  I have also attached an organization chart with phone numbers for each person.
 
 The areas where we do need to quickly establish a process is that of the contracts (both customer and facilitation eg pipeline, pools etc) as we will need to move very swiftly in the implementation of contracts to speed re-start  ( I also attach the contracts which we will be entering into at the end of this note).  
 
 Please let me know whether you would like a suite of the re-start plans, they are in the early stages but aim to be updated each day at the re-start meetings.
