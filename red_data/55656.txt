 Stinson,
 
 Here is the 1 factor HJM model for curve simulation originally designed for
 a Coal Plant valuation.
 
 This techniques is useful for all kinds of curves, especially when we 
 do not have the quality data to estimate other factors. (situations where
 only volatility curve is availiable).
 
 Let me know if you have any questions.
