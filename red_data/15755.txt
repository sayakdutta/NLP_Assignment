 darling boy-
 
 i'm never mad at you, never ever, and i really do adore you to death and
 forever and can't bear the idea that we wouldn't be friends till death do
 us
 part, and that i wouldn't be welcome in your life, so no, i was never mad
 and don't even remember which of my (many) soliloquoys you may have
 interrupted or are referring to but i do know that i have a rather
 boisterous personality and perhaps i stepped on your toes and this is not
 my
 intention and i adore you and my company is about to go under so the idea
 of
 being unemployed AND having you upset with me is far too much for my
 delicate self to handle...

 i was never mad at you.  i thought that you were mad at me for interrupting
 your soliloquy.
