 Marguerite:
 
 In an effort to finalize the documents that will need to be executed at
 closing, I have taken the liberty of drafting two written consents: one of
 the Members of Montana Megawatts I, LLC electing NorthWestern Generation I,
 LLC as the sole Manager, and the other of the sole Manager of the LLC
 replacing the officers and approving the loans from ENA and NorthWestern
 Generation I, LLC.  Let me know if you have any comments to the drafts.
 Apart from these consents, we will need to coordinate to draft a joint
 instruction letter to Citibank.
 
 Regards,
 
 Marisa
