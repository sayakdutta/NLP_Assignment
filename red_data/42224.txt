 >"Why are you crying?", a young boy asked his Mom.
 >
 >"Because I'm a woman", she told him.
 >
 >"I don't understand", he said.    His Mom just hugged
 >him and said, "And you never will, but that's ok".......
 >
 >Later the little boy asked his father, "Why does Mom
 >seem to cry for no reason?"    "All women cry for no
 >reason",was all his Dad could say......
 >
 >The little boy grew up and became a man, still wondering
 >why women cry.
 >
 >Finally he put in a call to God and when God got back
 >to him, he asked "God, why do women cry so easily?"
 >
 >
 >GOD answered......"When I made woman, I decided she
 >had to be special. I made her shoulders strong enough
 >to carry the weight of the world, yet, made her arms
 >gentle enough to give comfort...
 >
 >I gave her the inner strength to endure childbirth and
 >the rejection that many times will come even from her
 >own children.
 >
 >I gave her a hardness that allows her to keep going
 >and take care of her family and friends, even when
 >everyone else gives up, through sickness and fatigue,
 >without complaining....
 >
 >I gave her the sensitivity to love her children under
 >any and all circumstances.  Even when her child has
 >hurt her badly....
 >
 >She has the very special power to make a child's
 >boo-boo feel better and to quell a teenager's
 >anxieties and fears....
 >
 >I gave her strength to care for her husband, despite
 >faults and fashioned her from his rib to protect his
 >heart.
 >
 >I gave her wisdom to know that a good husband never
 >hurts his wife, but sometimes tests her strengths and
 >her resolve to stand beside him, unfalteringly.
 >
 >For all of this hard work, I also gave her a tear to
 >shed. It is hers to use whenever needed and it is her
 >only weakness....
 >
 >When you see her cry, tell her how much you love her,
 >and all she does for everyone, and even though she may
 >still cry, you will have made her heart feel good.
 >She is special!"
 >
 >Please send this to women you know, and those with
 >mothers, sisters, and special women  in their lives....
