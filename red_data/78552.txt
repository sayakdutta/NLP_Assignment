 2.     Probably Global Finance, depending on the structure of the deal.
 3.     Humm.
 4.    I guess I see the question as the overall role of outside counsel in 
 the transaction.  Good discussion item.

 Please call, I have 4 four unrelated issues which I need to discuss:
 
 1.   Whether in CA Power Development and Salmon, Enron will appoint any 
 officers or directors after it has reduced its ownership interest to 20%?
 
 2.  Who besides Christy Nicolay and Herman Manis should review Ameren 
 interconnect agreements?
 
 3.  Handling and payment of Piper Marbury past legal bills.
 
 4.  Want to discuss appropriateness of involving outside counsel for water 
 supply agreements with local water utilities for two Georgia power projects.
 
 Thanks.
