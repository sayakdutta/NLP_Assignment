 Thanks for the offer. I was really hoping to do a structuring rotation. I 
 have some interviews set up this week, so I will let you know what I decide 
 to do this week.  Thanks again.

 Thanks for the note.   I have a spot for you in our fundamentals group, which 
 there is a lot of interaction with tech, traders, and marketers, and good, 
 broad exposure to a number of enron's businesses.  We'd like to have you join 
 us.  Let me know if that is of interest.

 Jeff-
 Pete Keavey asked me to send you my resume. I was working in Dutch Quigley's 
 group for my first rotation. My second rotation was in the CALME Structuring 
 Group. Since CALME is going through a reorganization, the analysts were told 
 to find new rotations. I am currently interviewing with a few groups and I 
 would like for you to take a look at my resume. Please contact me if you have 
 any questions. Thank you for your time.
