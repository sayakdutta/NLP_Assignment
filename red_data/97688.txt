 
 I don't know any of them, although I am familiar with Vinson & Elkins--they 
 are an excellent firm.

 We have been given a new list of potential arbitrators.  Please take a minute 
 and let me know if any of these represent us, and the general level of 
 representation.  Thank you again for your help.  If you want to leave me a 
 voicemail, my telephone number is (713) 646-6412.
 
      1.  William Frank Carroll--Donohoe, Jameson & Carroll
      2.  James E. Coleman Jr.--Carrington, Coleman, Sloman & Blumenthal
      3.  Randall Duke--Johnson & McElroy
      4.  Edward Fiorito--Consultant
      5.  Eric F. Hale, Jr.--formerly with Carrington, Coleman; now 
 self-employed
      6.  Herbert J. Hammond--Thompson & Knight
      7.  Orrin Harrison--V&E
      8.  Brian J. Hurst--Baker & McKenzie
      9.  C. Michael Moore--Locke Liddell
     10.  Robert C. Prather, Sr.--Jordan, Dunlap, Prather & Harris, L.L.P.
 
 No need to respond as to V&E or Locke Liddell, except as to information about 
 the individuals.  Steve et al.,  Baker & McKenzie does represent Enron on 
 several matters of which I am aware, but to my knowledge it is not one of our 
 top 10 firms in billings.
