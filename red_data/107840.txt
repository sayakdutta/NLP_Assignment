 
 Very different hotels.  It is one of Paris' palace hotels right in the middle 
 of of the city.  (near vendome and concorde area)  very central to all of 
 paris.  costes is two minutes away, so both are great locations.  Big lobby, 
 lots of gold, etc.  Great, but not as cool/hip as costes.  
 
 How's London and the marketing of the 24/7 product?

 Jeff,
 Hey, I'm over in London. All is well over here.  I was curious if you were 
 familiar with the Crillon hotel in Paris?  If so, is it better than the Hotel 
 Costes???  I'm heading to Paris this weekend, let me know.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Dan
