 Scott Earnest is travelling late this afternoon to Richmond, Virginia, to 
 meet with Media General.  He will return to the office on Friday morning 
 around 10:00 a.m.
 
 Scott will be in negotiations and will not have his cell phone or pager on.  
 He will check voice mails frequently.  I will be available to take messages 
 also.
 
 Regards,
