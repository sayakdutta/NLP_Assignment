 An update -- CONFIDENTIAL please.
  
 The majority of people have voted for a financial congestion management model, which is what Enron wants.  It is based on the SPP cornerstones, which are LMP in real time, unbalanced schedules, and a variety of financial instruments to hedge the forward transmission market, including options/obligations/FTRs/ financial flowgate (bundled FTRs).
  
 We are in the process of trying to bring some others to this.  To facilitate this, the judge agreed with my idea that Enron (Mike Roan) and Entergy (Rick Riley who has worked with Ron Mc on the SPP model) would make these two "experts" available to visit with those that have further questions.
  
 In that regard, Tim Woodbury of Seminole and Bob Williams of FMPA would like to have a visit.  Tim is very close to agreeing that he likes the financial model (thanks to the good work in setting the basis of Dan Staines.)  Please let Mike Roan know if you would like to attend.
