 
 I've changed all the deals I could find that contained the counterparty name 
 "California Department of Water Resources - CDWR" to "California Energy 
 Resource Schedulers - State of California." The following deal numbers are 
 those that have been changed. If you come across other daily deals, most 
 likely done by EPMI Short Term California or Short Term Northwest, let me 
 know and I'll change those counterparty names too.
 
 510867/860/857/853/775/774
 
 509540/518/513/511/509/508/504/463/462
 
 Thanks for your help on this.
