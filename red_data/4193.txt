 Apparently the doctor says it's ok... I bet she said that she was better, but 
 not "hey, it's ok
 to go out, drink and dance in a room full of smoke and people."

 I went to the doctor yesterday and she said I'm much better.  Trust me, I
 haven't been out in an entire month, I am SO ready to do some drinking and
 dancing!
 Thanks for emailing Brian.
