 I think it's a mistake. It  should be February.

 Celeste, 
 
 I just received Datren Williams' acceptance with the following note attached:
 
 "My graduation date (Ph.D. Candidate from LSU) is Dec. 2000.  Celeste Roberts
 has informed me that I would have the option of starting work Feb. 2001.  I am
 under the impression that I will start in Feb. 2001.  My offer letter has a 
 start date 
 of Aug. 2001.  If this is a problem, please give me a call.  
 Looking forward to working at Enron.
 
 Thanks a million,
 Datren W."
 
 Please let me know if he may in fact start in Feb. 2001, and if so, do you 
 have
 a specific date for him, or may he choose?
 
 Thanks, Celeste,
 Carol
