 Ava,
 A conference room will not be necessary. You will only need a computer
 w/Internet access. 
 Anthony Burgs (UPS), Mike Boyd (UPS) and Glenn Lewis (Enron) will be there
 to walk you through the transition.  Mike will transfer all your files for
 you and set up w/the UPS software (WorldShip). Let me know if you have any
 questions. 
 Thanks,
 Verna 
 
 
 

  
 
 Would like to have UPS orientation on Monday, June 25th at 2pm.  Please
 let me know if I will need to schedule a conference room.  
 For Fed-Ex I have a software installed to print out my monthly labels do
 you have a UPS software  where I could do the same and is it possible to
 transfer all my information from Fed-Ex to UPS?  
 
 Thanks,
