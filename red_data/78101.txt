 
 The collective memory at ENA is that there wasn't an MOU per se, just the 
 assignment and assumption agreement.

 Brian,
 I spoke to Karl today, and we tried to find the "MOU".  All we have found
 was the "Assignment & Assumption Letter" you mention.
 In that document, the Enron and GE entities were; Enron Capitol & Trade
 Resources Corp. and General Electric Company, respectively.
 Regards,
 Jeff Smith
 
 


  
 
 
 I have a copy of the "Assignment and Assumption Letter"  where GE agreed
 that
 Cogen Technologies could assign the rights to purchase the Units to Enron
 Capital and Trade Resources, Corp.
 
 The initials at the ECT signature block is Doug Pedigo's.
 
 I have always been a little confused when Karl Siverling talks about voiding
 an
 MOU, because I do not remember ever seeing an MOU for the Cogen Tech  units.
 
 Perhaps we could ask Karl to send us a copy of the document he intends to
 void
 to make the process easier.
