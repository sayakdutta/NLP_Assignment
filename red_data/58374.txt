 Don Morton, general counsel of Wabash Valley Power Association, a co-op in 
 AEP's area, called me about Enron's protest of AEP's market based rates 
 filing.  Wabash has filed an appeal in the DC Circuit of AEP/CSW merger (its 
 brief is due 11/20).  He thinks FERC is out of control and not carrying on 
 its duties.  Wabash is also preparing a protest of the Alliance compliance 
 filing (due this Friday 10/6) on the following grounds:
 
 Filing is really a continuation of pancaking
 Does not want FERC to approve on a "conditional" basis (expecting Alliance to 
 be a true RTO)--Wabash thinks that Alliance simply creates a larger profit 
 center for AEP's transmission system
 
 Mr. Morton also had some specific OASIS problem examples that happened to 
 Wabash that involved preferential treatment for AEP.  I told him to call or 
 email Scott Miller for the investigation.
 
 Mr. Morton and Wabash CEO, Ed Martin, would like to come to Houston to visit 
 with Enron about our concerns and about the possibility of making some joint 
 filings.  His number is 317-481-2815.  Please let me know if I should set 
 something up or if someone else would like to talk with him directly.
