 On January 12, I hosted a brainstorming session at the Four Seasons hotel i=
 n=20
 downtown Houston in which we assembled a number of ideas regarding mid and=
 =20
 back office services we could offer to the commodity industry.  To complete=
  a=20
 plan for launching this strategic commercial venture, we are hosting an=20
 integrated design session facilitated by Cap Gemini Ernst & Young (CGEY) at=
 =20
 their Accelerated Solutions Environment in Dallas, Texas. =20
 
 I am personally extending an invitation to you to participate in this desig=
 n=20
 session.  This is a critical two-day event to be held February 12th and 13t=
 h=20
 in Dallas, Texas.   This work session is based on a unique approach called =
 a=20
 DesignShop=01v.  It is a very focused, activity-driven event that is compos=
 ed of=20
 various modules and exercises performed in small and large groups. If you=
 =20
 have not attended one of the DesignShops related to SAP, you will likely=20
 regard this session as different from any working session you have previous=
 ly=20
 experienced. The prior DesignShops held in conjunction with SAP have proven=
 =20
 to be very successful.  Therefore, we have elected to utilize this same=20
 methodology on this very critical and strategic venture.
 
 A limited number of representatives from Enron will be attending.  You were=
 =20
 selected to be one of approximately 30 key individuals to participate in th=
 e=20
 DesignShop. You are being asked to participate in the full two days with as=
 =20
 little distraction or interruption as possible.  The quality of our results=
 =20
 depends on each participant being fully engaged and participative for the=
 =20
 entire event.   Additionally, you will be relied on in the future to suppor=
 t=20
 and communicate our commercial strategy as it is defined at this session. =
 =20
 This date was specifically selected to avoid critical operational periods s=
 o=20
 that your participation can be maximized. Therefore, please make all=20
 necessary arrangements at the office to minimize your distractions during=
 =20
 these two days.
 
 Please review the attached information regarding hotel, flight information,=
 =20
 and transportation.  Preliminary information as to schedule and environment=
 =20
 has also been included.  You may direct any additional questions concerning=
 =20
 the event to Mary Solmonson at (713)-853-6079.
 
 I hope that you will be able to participate.  Please confirm your attendanc=
 e=20
 for the two days with Marvia Jefferson at 713-853-9165 by January 29th 5:00=
 =20
 p.m.  If you are unable to attend, it may be appropriate to select someone=
 =20
 else to participate.  Please do not extend an invitation to anyone else to=
 =20
 take your place until you and I have discussed this.
 
 I thank you in advance for your participation and look forward to seeing yo=
 u=20
 in Dallas!
