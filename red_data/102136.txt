 higher priority than short-term, because their tariff simply does not reflect 
 this.  Unfortunately it would have made our argument stronger if we could 
 have said it, but ...
 
 Anyway, I like what Steve has done here.  If there is no objection I'm going 
 to have him make the change described above and file it tomorrow.
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 

 
  
 Susan,  This looks fine to me but I want to confirm one statement.  In 
 section 3 on page 3 we state that TW intends to contract for long-term 
 capacity vs. short-term capacity and therefore we will have a higher priority 
 and will not be the "lowest priority on PNM".  Please confirm that a contract 
 for April to October is long term on PNM.  I initially understood we would 
 contract for one month with an evergreen provision or rolling month to month 
 type of contract therefore I just wanted to make sure this statement fits 
 with our Marketing Depts intent.  Thanks.
 
 Glen
