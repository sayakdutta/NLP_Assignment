 Dear Dr. Kaminski,
 
 On behalf of Dean Arthur Warga, I would like to confirm our visit to Enron
 on August 3 at 10 a.m. I will also be leaving a phone message to this
 effect. We are very much looking forward to meeting you and discussing some
 of the issues we talked about on the phone today. Thank you for making the
 time, and for your hospitality in arranging the lunch.
 
 
 Best wishes,
 
 Praveen
