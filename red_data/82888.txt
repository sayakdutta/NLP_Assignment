 I was talking to Frank Vickers and he mentioned that you might want to talk 
 about an opportunity on the trading side of the East group.  I just wanted to 
 drop a note to let you know that I will be out of the office from Monday, 
 Feb. 12 through Wednesday, Feb. 14.  However, I am eager to discuss any 
 opportunities in trading.  Leave me a voice mail or just catch me at anytime 
 on Thursday.
