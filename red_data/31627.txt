 It is a CES deal.  I have some support that Cindy faxed me.  What is your fax 
 number and I'll send it to you.
 
 Thanks for your help

 I just left Cingy a message  - I said that I'm not aware of any imbalance 
 trades that we intiated.  However, it could have been done by CES or EES.  I 
 asked her to call me back.

 Chris, I am still trying to get these imbalance trades resolved.  John Bieltz 
 is no longer with Amereda Hess but Cindy Wernecke has been working this 
 issue.  She can be reached at (703) 317-2293.  Can you please get back to me 
 as soon as possible as they would like to resolve.
 
 Thanks
 Laurie

 No, I still haven't gotten anywhere on this.  My contact at Amereda Hess 
 (formerly Statoil) is John Bieltz.  His number is 703-317-2318 and his email

 I'm sorry I have not responded sooner.  Any new developement on this?  To my 
 knowledge, ENA has not done any imbalance trades.  Do you have a contact at 
 Statoil?  I can call and try to get more info.  It could be some CES thing we 
 were not aware of.

 Chris, do you have any information on an imbalance trade with Statoil on CNG 
 Niagara Mohawk for January and April 2000?  Statoil has been very patient 
 awaiting payment on this, but I cannot seem to find anything.  Gloria 
 Barkowsky suggested that I talk to you.  Thanks for your help.
