 The meeting will not happen on Wednesday, but Mark is shooting for Thursday or Friday.  Mark, could you make sure our distinguished colleagues from Govt. Affairs are kept in the loop on these meetings?  Thanks, DB

 Don, I'd like to be there for the discussion tomorrow, schedule permitting.  Jim didn't indicate what time it would be.  Could you let me know?

 Don --
 
 Can you please add Becky Cantrell, Melinda Pharms, and Guillermo Canovas to your Nat Gas weekly discussions?  Not sure if they will all come, but I'd like someone from Government Affairs at the meeting to try and keep us up-to-date on the issues.
