 
 Enclosed is a copy of the generation reports we put together using your 
 generation database.  Please look them over and make sure that they are in 
 the correct order an make sense.  Some of the monthly averages in the report 
 do not match the CEMS database number.  I wanted to know if I should fill in 
 the historicals with the CEMS numbers or keep these.  If you could just look 
 these over and let me know if they make sense I would appriciate it.
