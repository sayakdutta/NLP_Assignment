 All:
 
 I'm attempting to use lattice on windows 2000 under R 1.4.
 
 Rgui and Rterm crash when I invoke "xyplot" or "trellis.device" commands (including the oft-used "quakes" example)
 
 In particular, I get a message box from the windows OS with the following text:
 
 Rgui.exe has generated errors and will be closed by Windows.  
 You will need to restart the program.  
 
 An error log is being generated
 
 
 this seems to happen right after the graphics window is spawned. 
 
 I'm using lattice version 0.4-0 and grid version 0.5
 
 am I missing some sort of prep work for lattice graphics?
 
 thanks any help,
 Cooper
