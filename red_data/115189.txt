 same deal to me to put in - sorry about that!

 Kate I just queried for the last deal and I don't see one like it at all:
 Tom Alonso:
 Enron sells to Merrill 25 mw of March PV at $215  peak hrs,----Bloomberg is 
 broker
 
 
 
 
 

 
   
  
 516626
 Sell BP
 25 mw
 175.00/on peak
 q4-01
 
 516627
 sell williams
 25 mw
 175.00/on peak
 q4-01
 
 And the last deal is in, according to Tom and Mike Swerzbin - Tom entered it, 
 but it's in Mike's book. Let me know if it's still not in there.
