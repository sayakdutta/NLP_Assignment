 
 My only comment relates to the Azurix reference  ... it's not a significant 
 part of the biz and things have changed recently.  i don't think it merits 
 reference.

 Steve- can you have someone take a look at the attached article and give me 
 your thoughts. There is a lot of information in there that I did not provide 
 but they must be picking up from literature. Thanks, Rick

 Hi Rick,
 
 Thank you again for spending time with Alan and me this week on the Enron case
 study for my book.  Attached for your review is a draft that we put 
 together.  I
 think you will be happy with the tone and content of the case.  Otherwise,
 please call me to discuss any changes you might have.
 
 (See attached file: 17_Enron-am-jl.doc)
 
 Note that the case makes reference to three charts that you said you would 
 email
 to me:
 
    Organizational chart of the RAC Group and summary descriptions (we will use
    this information to update this section of the case)
    Dashboard approval sheet (cartoon version)
    1-page flow chart of Board transaction approval process
 
 Please provide these three charts and any changes you might have by Friday,
 9/15.  Thanks.
 
 Regards,
 James
