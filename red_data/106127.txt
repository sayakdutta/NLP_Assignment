 and ENA that exceed the cap, full payment cannot be made.  Should the 
 payments be allocated proportionately or according to receipt of demand, or 
 do we care?  I hope this helps.  SS 
 
 
    
 I'm not sure what this means.

 Susan B. should have gotten our draft of the referenced guaranty to you.  It 
 still needs to be reviewed by the physical gas group since we are amending 
 their guaranty.  Do you care about any allocation of payments between HPL and 
 ENA?  At the moment, I do not have any allocation language in the guaranty.
