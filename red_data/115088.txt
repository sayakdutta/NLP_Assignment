 
 Happy Monday - or whenever it is that you are blessed with the receipt of 
 this message. A funny thing happened to me on my way to upload the PX deals 
 on Friday. I went to process the data and was rudely stopped by an error 
 message stating the following:
 
 Error establishing lock on Trader ID and Trader  (_InboxAC11AC92.913Aoc376A1622250.4) 
 
 Interesting, isn't it? So I entered the PX deals manually and went along my 
 merry way. Just thought you should know.
