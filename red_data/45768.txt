 
 Karen,
 
 Upon re-review w/Credit, we have decided not to open this counterparty up for 
 financial trading until further legal and credit issues are resolved.

 John Arnold wants this counterparty opened ASAP for financial.  We didn't 
 have any financial statements from them when they originally came thru, so we 
 couldn't determine their ESP status, but we're OK now, so if you could open 
 them for financial ASAP.
 
 Thanks.
