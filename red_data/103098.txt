 Tim,
 
 I just want to tell you how much I respect and admire how you have handled this situation. It is not lost on many of us that we owe not only our bonuses but also our jobs to you personally.
 
 I am glad to be part of the new crew, and wanted you to know that I am grateful for all of your efforts on my behalf over the years. It is not often that an assistant is given the opportunities to advance that I was given.  
 
 Thank you.
