 management, if the right program were set up -- eg a demand buydown program.

 Apparently there are rumors that Ken Lay promised to make some kind of 
 investment in California when he was talking to folks in the state ($300 
 million in DSM?)  Do any of you know what this commitment might be?  Sandy 
 needs to be filled in on this.  Let me know as soon as you can.
