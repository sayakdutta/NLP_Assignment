 I printed 12/4 consolidated report for Sally.  It is again very small.  Any 
 possibility that you can change format to enlarge (very large margins).  I 
 can go in every time & reformat, but it seems a waste of time to do every 
 time when you can just change your template once.

 Here is the draft of the needs assessment for global standards.  Please give 
 me your input.  Kelly is devoting 100% of her time to putting together an 
 access database to report these standards.
 
 Also, here is a consolidated view of A01 for 12 /04.
 
 Thanks
 
 Shona
