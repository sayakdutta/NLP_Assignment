 
 Wednesday  any time after 3:30pm would work well for me.
 
  
     
 Thanks a bunch for listening to us last night.  We look forward to showing
 you our
 stuff.  Could you possibly schedule us next Wednesday afternoon at your
 convenience?
 JP is going to Phoenix and won't be back till late on Friday.  Conversely,
 if your
 schedule opens up this afternoon, let me know.
 
 Thanks again.
 
 K.
