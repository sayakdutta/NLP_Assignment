 
 I just looked at the first couple of documents attached and wanted to make 
 sure the second item listed in them works.  Is everyone comfortable that the 
 volume should be submitted in megawatts and then divided in half to produce 
 megawatt hours?  I think it works but I had to work through it to get there - 
 it wasn't immediately obvious to me.

 Dave,
 
 Here are the final Long Form Descriptions for the remaining regions (NSW, 
 QLD, SA).
 
 The term of the Swaps that will initially be offered via EOL has yet to be 
 decided, but I assume we can set those in the Product Manager when we create 
 Australian Power Products.
