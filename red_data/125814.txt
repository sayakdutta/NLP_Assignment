 The ESBI Alberta Ltd.(EAL) would like to invite you to a presentation of the
 results from the Powertech study to be held at EAL's offices from 2:00 pm to
 4:00 pm on Tuesday October 9, 2001..  EAL commissioned Powertech Labs of
 Vancouver earlier this year to carry out studies to derive Total Transfer
 Capabilities (TTC) for both imports and exports across the AB-BC
 interconnection.  These studies have now been completed and work is underway
 to revise existing operating policies (ie.  Specifically OP-333 and OP-328).
 The studies confirm that there is an increase in export capability from
 additional generation in the Calgary area.
 
 This presentation will focus on the technical results of the Powertech
 studies and the impact on TTC for the AB-BC interconnection.  To make the
 most of this meeting, please give some consideration to questions of
 clarification around TTC you may require.  Please confirm your attendance at
 this meeting with Debbie Nering at (403)-705-5210 or e-mail at

 Thursday October 4, 2001.
 
 Yours truly,
 TRANSMISSION ADMINISTRATOR OF ALBERTA
