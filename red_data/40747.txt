 Jeff:
 
 I've talked to Jayshree.  All we have to get out tonight is the info books.  Let's review the letter, term sheet, diagram and CAs tomorrow morning and send them up by e-mail.
 
 I suggest we meet at 8:00 or 8:30 in my office tomorrow morning to finalize everything.

 	Attached is a draft cover letter and transaction diagram for the Dynegy deal.  Travis is going to forward me the executed versions of all the associated documents.  Let me know your comments.  Thanks.
