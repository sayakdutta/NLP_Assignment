 
 Ray, if Mark does not have any other comments - lets go ahead and send the 
 memo out ASAP.

 Dave/Mark,
 
 Attached is a revised memo reflecting Dave's comments.  Please let me know if 
 you have any further thoughts.  For the rest of the week, I am going to be at 
 Edward Ondarza's offsight, but I can be reached via cell phone (713-416-6429) 
 or via email.  Marsha (x33356) can also track me down.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Ray
