 
 This is a slam dunk. Don't screw it up.
 
 Ok, seriously.  Carlos, you missed a wonderful evening on Friday.  John, it 
 is hard to believe that  you could have acutually have married UP.  Good for 
 you.  Please thank  Debbie for a perfect night.  
 
 John, more details on the platimum AMEX with President's Club membership.  
 For real?
 
 I'll process the assignment to John on Monday.  I don't expect a problem, and 
 am ready for it if it surfaces.  No big deal.

 Suzanne is out today, so would you mind finding this document and having 
 someone fax it to me?  I'll email my fax number to you.

 Hi.
 
 There's a document in my O drive directory called kendallsale, or something 
 close.  I can't remember where I put it - probably under General LOI.  Could 
 you email it to me?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
