 
 There is also a california update call (used to be daily, now weekly).  
 Marcia Linton (Jim Steffes' assistant) can give you the call in information 
 and add you to the distribution list.

 Steve,
 I just added Shirley this morning, and I am forwarding her the articles that 
 I distributed earlier today.

 You mentioned at the end of our conf call last week that there might be an 
 internal distribution I should be on.  Is there someone I should contact to 
 get on the list?
