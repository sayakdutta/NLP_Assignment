 realistic.  Today is my favorite day of the month...we're rolling everything 
 today!!!  Let me  rephrase that I'M rolling everything tonight.  Maybe that 
 way I won't have to reroll it in the morning!!

 Let me rewind.... HI, Good Morning, ready for a full  10 hour shift? Knowing 
 how things are down there, you might just be starting your day. Ready for 
 another 10-11 hours??
