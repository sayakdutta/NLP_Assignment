 I've discussed in detail the strategic outline/process with both John and 
 Larry and they're both in agreement.  We're (EGM Orig. Team) meeting w/ 
 McKinsey this Friday to "kick it off!"  We'll start implementing the Regional 
 Analysis the following week.  The wheels are in motion!
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
    
 Randy,
 Thanks for the update.  I like your plan.  I like the McKinsey part as 
 well.   Please make sure that Suzanne understands the plan and that you John 
 and Larry agree on the way forward.  If there are any issues, please let Jeff 
 or me know..
