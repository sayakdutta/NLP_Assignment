   Re:   I.00-08-002  Subpoenas Served on Enron Power
 Marketing, Inc. ("EPMI"), Enron Energy Services Operations Inc. and Enron
 Energy Services Inc. (collectively referred to as "EES"), Enron Energy
 Marketing Corporation ("EEMC"), and Portland General Electric Corporation

 Entities")
 
 Harvey,
 
  As set forth in Gary Fergus' e-mail message dated October 6, 2000,
 and pursuant to our conference call today, the Enron Entities are producing
 the enclosed documents (Bates numbered "Enron Entities 000001-_______")
 pursuant to the above described subpoenas issued by the California Public
 Utility Commission (hereinafter "the Commission").
 
  The Enron Entities produce these documents pursuant to our email
 exchange of October 3, 2000 with the understanding that the Commission
 agrees that by producing these documents, the Enron Entities have not waived
 any objections or challenges to these subpoenas whatsoever and that any
 claims, defenses, objections, jurisdictional or otherwise or other responses
 have been specifically reserved and can be raised in the future, if
 necessary.
 
  In addition, the Enron Entities produce these documents with the
 understanding that if any entity obtains a more stringent protective order
 than the one currently in place, that all of the Enron Entities document
 productions will be protected by the most stringent protective order.  In
 addition, if, at the request of any party or nonparty to this proceeding,
 the Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction orders that the requests
 for production be limited, reduced or eliminated, the Enron Entities reserve
 the right to limit the production of documents in conformance with such
 order.
