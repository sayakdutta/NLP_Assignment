 We have also bought HE 10 and HE 11 from the APX.  We bought 35 mws for HE 10 at $35, and 31 mws for HE 11 at $35.
 
 
  
     
 Group,
 
 We are short 50 mws in ST-WBOM at $42.88 for HE 7-22 Friday and Saturday in SP-15.
 
 
 
 I have picked up some shaped mws from the APX for the afternoon peak on Friday.  These pieces will need to be scheduled with the APX as the counterparty for HE 12-20.  
 
 HE 12: 26 mws
 HE 13: 23 mws
 HE 14: 20 mws
 HE 15: 17 mws
 HE 16: 18 mws
 HE 17: 16 mws
 HE 18: 17 mws
 HE 19: 20 mws
 HE 20: 19 mws
 Price is $35.
 
 ST-CALI is also 25 mws short both days on-peak.
 
 
 
 Thanks,
 Bill
