 Ken asked me to advise you that he will be out of the city on March 21.  
 Thanks for including him.

 Good morning Ken,
 Just wanted to take a moment to thank you for being the "Honorary Chair" for 

 meeting you at the "Enron Excellence Awards" presentation and genuinely 
 appreciate your support.  When we spoke, you said that you may not be able to 
 play in the tournament.  I certainly understand, but if you are available to 
 play (or make an appearance at the dinner afterward), it would most 
 beneficial to our outcome.  Please let me know if you are available.
 
 Thanks,
 Jeff McClellan
