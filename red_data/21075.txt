 Cara,
 

 I notified Karen of this cut at 16:55

 
 Karen maintains that stateline energy is delivered to Grant's Interconnect and not to a valid Mid C delivery point.
 I gave Alicia BPA (T) and WWP (T) as valid wheels to deliver, but she had already decided to cut and L & D upstream (ulitmately PSCO)
 
 
 I had a long conversation w/
 Matt (Pacificorp)
 Steve (PPM)
 and Karen (Chelan)
 -We talked mainly about the reliability of the energy and the details of the path, but nobody offered a viable solution.  I pointed out the two wheels that could be purchased real time, but this is not there obligation.
 
 Note:

 
 Call me with any question,
