 
 it is okay if i am getting old b/c i age really well.  anyway, men get 
 distinguished as they age.  i don't care how old i get just as long as i keep 
 my hair.  i can't believe you don't like freds when it is packed.  that is 
 the best time to be at that place.  i do feel better at work today.  i found 
 out i get to go to monterey, cali in two weeks for a boondoggle.  it is all 
 paid for and all i will do is booze and golf.  i look foward shit like that 
 now.    you should be going out every night while you can.  one day you will 
 hit the real world and you can't do that.  lsu is not the real world.  you 
 can still party a lot while you work, you just have to be in pain at work and 
 pretend like you are not hung over so they don't think you have a problem.  i 
 usually go out 2-3 nights a week.  i try to live like a rock star (like 
 britney spears).  email me back when you get a chance.
