 As you my recall, you returned the original subcontractor letter with respect 
 to the referenced agreement as you were unable to locate the original Project 
 Services Agreement in Enron's files.  I was just talking to Carol St. Clair, 
 one of the attorneys I work for, and we are of the agreement that we cannot 
 sign this side subcontractor letter until we track down where the original 
 agreement is.  How can we locate the orignal agreement within Enron Corp.?
