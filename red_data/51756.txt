 Andy,
 
 I am sending you a draft oof a proposal regarding national forum for top 
 finance practitioners and
 academics. The idea came from a professor at Rice University who
 has already received a commitment from a number
 of most distinguished CFOs. 
 
 Please, read the outline and see if you would be interested in joining this 
 forum.
 I shall be glad to help to arrange  a meeting with Prof. Ikenberry.
 
 Vince
