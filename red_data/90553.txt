 I spoke to Steve at Vitol and he changed the seats for you....6 DEF and 7DEF both to and from Ft. Lauderdale.
 
 Thanks Tjae
 
  
     
 With respect to the flight to Ft. Lauderdale on 9/13, can you see if Steve or Continental can improve our row 25 seats to a bulkhead row for both the outgoing and return flights.   Let me know.
 
 Thanks.
