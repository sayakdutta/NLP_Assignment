 
 It happens to me pretty regularly.
 
 Time:  Yesterday around 4:30 pm
 
 Conversation:
 
 Him:	yo
 Me:	hey
 Him:	guess what
 Me:	what
 Him:	i'm an engaged man
 Him:	that kind of came out of nowhere huh
 
 There was about 15-20 more of conversation which we can discuss later, but needless to say I'm still reeling.
 
 So are you heading up to Austin today?
