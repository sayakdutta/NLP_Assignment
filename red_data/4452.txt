 
 Gary,
 
 We are still in the determination phase as far as what we are willing to 
 sell.  Obviously, we would like to sell as close to the 10 yr average as 
 possible. However, given the recent warmth of the past few winters and the 
 forecsts,  this is probably an unrealistic goal.  I will get back to you by 
 the end of the week with an acceptable target.
 
 Thanks,

 Eric,
 
 I've put a Jan-Mar Hobby $10,000/$2 million swap offer in the market of 635 
 HDDs.  635 is the 10 year average.  Given the forecasts for normal to warm in 
 the Gulf area this winter - with particular emphasis on warmth in the Jan-Mar 
 period - I anticipate that bids will come back, initially, around 560 - and 
 that we might be able to sell a swap around 585.  As a frame of reference, 
 last year (2000) came in at 412.5 HDDs and 1999 came in at 429.5 HDDs.
 
 What kind of number are you looking for  - do you want to leave an order with 
 me where you'd be willing to sell the swap?
 
 If you're interested in buying an option, perhaps you'd like to put a bid out 
 on the following structure:
 
 Hobby
 Jan-Mar
 $15,000/HDD
 $2,700,000 Limit
 560 strike (1/2 standard deviation from the 10 year average)
 
 I imagine you could get this option for approx. $750,000.  The same option 
 with a $2,000,000 limit would go for about $100,000 less.
 
 Let me know your thoughts.
 
 Regards,
 Gary
