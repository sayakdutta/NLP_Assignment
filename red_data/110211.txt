 Hey cutie
 
 It's all good.  I e-mailed Sharon and Bill and gave Duncan the skinny.  Bill
 is in and he, Duncan and I are sending you the $308 asap.   I did not yet
 hear back from Sharon but I have to assume she is in.  Also, Sandra
 Lewis(GK's Sandra)  said she may be into the trip, just waiting to hear back
 on that.
 
 While everyone seemed to feel the 22nd-25th sounded fine they all expressed
 interest in mid-march as well.  Did you find out when it might be availible
 then???  I'll call you today for a final chat!
 love, k
