 A copy of Paul Schultz's paper, "Who Makes the Market," is now
 available.  The paper to can be obtained (by Monday for sure) from Felicia
 Jones (Economics), Latha Ramchand (University of Houston), and Vince
 Kaminski (Enron) or Barbara Ostdiek (everyone else).
 
 Paul's seminar is Friday, March 30, at 3:30 in Room 201 (note the room 
 change).
 
 The abstract of the paper is copied below:
 
 Abstract
 
 "I provide evidence that Nasdaq dealers make markets in the stocks in which
 they receive order flow.  Several variables used to proxy for the stocks
 that individual market maker's brokerage customers would trade, including
 trading volume, location, underwriting participation and analyst coverage,
 are significant determinants of market marking activity.  Informational
 advantages may also be a factor in the market making decision as evidenced
 by dealers specializing in stocks in specific industries.  Some potential
 problems that arise when researchers ignore the integration of market
 making with brokerage, securities analysis and underwriting businesses are
 discussed."
