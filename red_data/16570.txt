 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

   GOVERNOR DAVIS CALLS SPECIAL
 LEGISLATIVE SESSION ON ENERGY
 
 SACRAMENTO - Governor Gray Davis today issued a proclamation requiring the
 legislature to convene a special session to pass legislation addressing
 California's energy crisis.
 
 According to the guidelines of the proclamation, the session will focus on
 legislation that:
 
 Affects the availability, consumption, and use of energy;
 Governs the finances and organization of the California Independent System
 Operator (ISO) and the California Power Exchange (PX);
 Addresses the operation, maintenance, and finances of California power
 generators and utilities;
 Affects the wholesale and retail markets for energy supplies, capacity, and
 reliability; and
 Protects the health and safety of Californians with respect to
 power-generating facilities and transmission facilities.
 "In response to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) failure to
 meet its obligations, I am taking the extraordinary step of calling the
 California Legislature into a concurrent Extraordinary Session to
 immediately address the energy situation in our state," said Governor Davis.
 "I will call them to do at least the following: Replace the so-called
 stakeholders on the ISO Board with Californians who are more concerned about
 affordable prices and reliability of power and; re-establish the authority
 for the state to inspect private power plants to assure the coordination of
 maintenance and operating schedules; and provide low-interest financing for
 new peaking facilities or re-powering old ones to make them cleaner and more
 efficient in return for committing their power to Californians at guaranteed
 low rates."
 
 Governor Davis used his constitutional power to call for the special session
 (Section 3(b) Article IV). The session will begin on January 3, 2001. Each
 house of the legislature will be responsible for the scheduling of hearings
 and the calendar for the session.
 
 Governor Davis called a special session on education in 1999, and the
 legislature passed a series of sweeping initiatives to improve academic
 performance and accountability.
