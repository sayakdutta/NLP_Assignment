 
 Geynille,
 
 I understand you are in charge of recruiting at the UofH. I am forwarding to 
 you the resume 
 of one of the students  of the University of Houston.
 
 She is involved with the international organization called AIESEC and I was 
 most
 impressed by her organizational skills and professional attitude. I used
 to work as a volunteer for this organization many years ago and I am
 still helping their local chapter.
 
 As far as I know, she signed up for an interview with Enron.
