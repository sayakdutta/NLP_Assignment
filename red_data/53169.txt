 
 Larry,
 
 I shall be glad to join you at the Colloquium as well.
 I haven't lost even one million dollars  yet and I have 
 to get up to speed.

 COLLOQUIUM TITLE
 My Manhattan Project: A Physicist's
 Adventures on Wall St
 Nigel Goldenfeld
 Department of Physics
 University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

 Abstract
 Why is Wall St. one of the biggest
 employers of physicists? What is the
 quickest way to lose a billion dollars? How
 might academic physicists gain
 experience of real world applications? And
 why bother? I discuss these and
 other questions in light of my own
 experience, starting a software company
 to market ultra-fast tools for risk
 management of derivative securities.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 Guys:
          Professor Nigel Goldenfeld of the University of Illinois, [who
 also runs an options pricing software firm, NumenX, with Professor Mitchell
 Feigenbaum of Rockefeller University] will be visiting the University of
 Houston Physics department Monday and Tuesday September 24-25.  Goldenfeld
 arrives on Monday afternoon, and we were wondering if there would be any
 interest in anyone there going out to dinner with us on Monday evening
 (Sept. 24).  His Colloquium will be given at 3:00-4:00 PM (rather than the
 normal 4:00-5:00 PM) on Tuesday afternoon in room 634 SR1 on our campus,
 but at present it is on Soft Condensed Matter Physics, and I don't know if
 he will say anything about his work in "Econophysics."  He has also been a
 pivotal person in starting an "Econophysics" program at Illinois.  You can
 either let me know or get in touch with Mike Gorman, who is coordinating
