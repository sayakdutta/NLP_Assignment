 
 Emmisions Trading will go from Kevin Presto  (Greg Wolfe) to George McClellan 
 under the following  conditions.
 
 1 -  Volumes will not fall.  In fact they will increase.
 
 2 - Wolfe will retain 1 Million of the 3 Million VAR for six months and then 
 East Power will have no Emmisions Positions,
 
 3 -  Janel Guerrero (middle marketer) will follow the book to coal.
 
 4 - East Power and Coal will get together and (hopefully) agree on a transfer 
 pricing mechanism for existing positions if there are any that Greg is not 
 keeping.
 
 Give me a call if there are any issues.
