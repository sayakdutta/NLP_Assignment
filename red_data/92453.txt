 
 Sounds like you have a wild night planned.  I don't think I'm up to that kind 
 of partying tonight.  I've actually finished the evaluations, but I haven't 
 submitted them yet.  I'll do that today.  Thanks for the warning though.  
 
 How late were you here last night?  How did everything turn out with your 
 boss yesterday?
 
 Later,
 Robin

 Did you finish all your evaluations?  
 
 I haven't .  I called  PEP and they are going to shut the system down at 
 midnight tonight.  Just wanted to let you know in case you are planning on 
 having an awesome friday afternoon like I am.  I am going to bring popcorn 
 and a good CD.
