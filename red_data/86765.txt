 Thanks for the email.  Kali was not able to make last Sunday's game due to a 
 schedule conflict that I had.  Plus, she will not go to the last game because 
 her best friend's birthday party is at the same time.  I had her skip another 
 friend's party to make the one game she did participate in (all the softball 
 girls schedule their parties on Sunday so as not to conflict with those 
 games!!).  If it's not too late, do not order a trophy for her.  She really 
 was never much of a team participant.  I'm hoping her enthusiasm this fall 
 will be like last fall and not this spring.  Thanks for all your help, time 
 and effort.

 P.S.-
 Do you know who some of the U10 girls coaches will be??  Will you be 
 coaching?  I did not sign up to coach because I may asst. coach my son's U6 
 team.
