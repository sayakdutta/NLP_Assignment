 
 Do these numbers include both EES and EEMC with respect to both PGE and SCE.  
 If not I need them all combined.
 
 Thanks for your help.

 Per Mike's request, the attached note has our latest estimate on PX credits.  
 We are expecting to have a final estimate by Friday.  Let me know if this 
 timing works for you.  Thanks.

 Our current estimate of PX credits thru Mid March is ~$570MM including the 
 $269MM we transferred to EPMI in Dec.  I don't expect the rest of March to be 
 large, but I'll get you an update asap.
