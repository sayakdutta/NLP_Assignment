 The recently announced "new" deep discounts on the upfront purchase price of 
 airline tickets with our preferred air carriers booked through the Travel 
 Agency in the Park have been well received!
 
 Increased airline ticket bookings with our preferred carriers was expected in 
 the Enron Houston offices.  The response from the Enron business units 
 outside the Houston area has been remarkable.  As a result, call volume to 
 TAP has increased by 30%.
 
 As a result of this 30% increase in call volume, TAP continues to add 
 qualified, experienced agents to their staff to meet the increased needs of 
 Enron travelers.
 
 If your "Enron Business Unit/Location" was not previously using TAP for your 
 airline bookings, please contact Tracy Ramsey, Enron Corporate Travel 
 Manager, 713/853-6457 to assist you with your transition process to TAP.
 
 This transition process will include items such as setting-up Traveler 
 Profiles in the TAP system to expedite the booking process and establishing 
 your travel patterns so that TAP can respond to your specific travel needs 
 and requirements.
 
 The Travel Agency in the Park has established a web site, 
 http://www.travelpark.com, that is available to you for browsing flight 
 schedules and booking flights.
 
 Thank you for our support of the Enron Travel Program that continues to 
 provide exceptional cost savings to Enron Corp.
 
 Please contact Tracy Ramsey, 713/853-6457 if you have questions or comments.
