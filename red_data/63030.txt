 Just as a reminder to everyone, there is a meeting in John Lavorato's office 
 this Friday June 2nd regarding Dayrates
 
 John
 
 Enclosed is the presentation that Keith MacIvor and I gave to Noble 
 Drilling's CEO, Jim Day and Pride International's CEO, Paul Bragg, their CFO, 
 Earl McNiel, and their COO, James Allen this morning 5/30.  Both sets of 
 leaders were extremely interested in pursuing dayrate transactions with us.  
 Both sets said that they believed this product would have a very positive 
 impact of the drilling business.
 
 Jim Day assigned us to his leading financial innovators, Mark May and Steve 
 Manz.  Paul Bragg and Earl McNiel are wanting to sign an ISDA asap and begin 
 discussions asap.
 
  I will be giving the same presentation to the CEO of Diamond Offshore, Jim 
 Tisch this Thursday (in New York) and a "deal specific" presentation to the 
 CFO of Chiles Offshore the same day.
