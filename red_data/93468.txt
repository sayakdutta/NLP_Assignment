 The gas group stopped publishing it to the website, but I am not sure if they 
 use the info for other purposes.  Maybe Robin or David can respond to that 
 issue.

 Chris, most of the remaining people on the distribution list are EES 
 management.  Does Corp no longer require the Basis position report to be 
 prepared daily?  If so, we will no longer send it.
 
 Thanks,

 You can take Michael Benien and myself off of the list, as we no longer use 
 this report.   Additionally, you should remove Rahmaan Mwongozi and Gabriel 
 Monroy as they no longer work in the gas group.  You might want to check with 
 the others to see if the report needs to continue going to them also.
 
 Thanks,
 Chris
