 Ben,
 
 As requested I have attached BPI's 2nd QTR EDR reports for your review, 
 comment and record.  I do not have a "Final" or accepted 3rd QTR EDR from the 
 EPA yet.  
 
 Respectfully Mitchell
 
 
 
 
    
  
 There is only one quarterly report required for Brownsville. This is the EPA 
 electronic data report (EDR) which we generate from the CEMS system and 
 submit electronically to the EPA. 
 
 Mitchell - Since you are generating the 3rd quarter reports to the EPA today, 
 would you please copy Ben on the submittal. Thanks.

 Do you happen to have or know where the CEMS Quarterly Report for Brownsville 
 may be.  Thanks!
