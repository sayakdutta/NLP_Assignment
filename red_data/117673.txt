  Mark, I would like to take vacation on the Thursday, April 8 (1998 
 Discretionary Day which I previously spoke to you about that B. Whitehead did 
 not complete correctly on my 12/98 timesheet), Friday, April 9 (1999 
 Discretionary Day) and Monday and Tuesday, April 12 and 13th (vacation 
 days).  I spoke with Marie and Tana; they will be in the office on these 
 days.   Please let me know if this meets with your approval.
