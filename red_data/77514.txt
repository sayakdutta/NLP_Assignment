 Just to clarify, we intend to assign the land option to Rocky Mount, they buy 
 it and lease the land to us once they own it/annex it/zone it.

 In preparation for the Wednesday North Carolina Utility Commission Staff 
 meeting (1 pm Houston time), we are aware of at least the following 3 issues 
 that the staff are interested in discussing (most knowledgeable ENRONers 
 listed in parentheses):
 
 Status of the gas deal (John Hodge),
 Status of annexation (Heather, Ozzie, Jeffrey), and
 Status of VEPCO PPA (Heather, Ozzie).
 
 Jeffrey left Bill Sherk a message (August 28, 2000) regarding site layout, 
 landuse permitting/zoning, and annexation.  Once Bill calls back, Jeffrey 
 will be able to comment further on the process/progress.  Heather and 
 Ozzie--is it OK to tell the staff that we intend to buy the land, deed it to 
 the City of Rocky Mount, and they subsequently annex?
 
 Allyson Duncan indicates that this is a proactive meeting and the staff will 
 not be confrontational or adversarial.
 
 Please give feedback on these issues and any others including related 
 conference call discussion by noon on Tuesday so that everyone can be 
 prepared.
 
 Thanks for your help,
