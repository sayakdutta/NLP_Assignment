 
 Kimball, Bay State and The Energy Authority were all amendments, even tho 
 Credit didn't have them marked as such.  Kimball, I am ok with the change 
 adding physical gas, they were previously shut down for financial and power, 
 and no change there.  Bay State was previously shut down for financial and 
 power, no change there, OK with adding physical gas.  The Energy Authority, I 
 had previously shut down for financial, open for all power.  Now, per Leslie, 
 have them open for US power sells only, so I'm changing that.
 
 Hetch-Hetchy Water and Power is a division of the City of San Francisco, so I 
 am shutting them down for all financial.
