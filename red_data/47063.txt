 I just got a call from Select Energy and they would like to get an ISDA in 
 place with us.  I told them they would have to go through Credit first.  The 
 person I spoke to was Neil Herzig, Contract Administrator, his ph is: (860) 
 665-3275.  He said his Credit contact is Valerie Mooney at (860) 665-2387.
