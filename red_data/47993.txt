 
 When you have a minute, I've been inputting data all week and have 
 fixes/upgrades we need to the database.  In particular, the EOL people are 
 about to introduce a new product any time time now, and I need that sort the 
 shows "Approved, approved with limits, not approved" to work so I won't have 
 to look at each of 1500 entries to determine what limits are in place.  When 
 you arrive Monday can you let me know how long it will take you to have that 
 sort working.  Then, maybe we can get together and discuss other changes we 
 need to make.
 
 Much thanks!
