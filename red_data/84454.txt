 Gerald, I have discussed the papering of this transaction with SPPC and NPC 
 and we will proceed with the raising of a Master Firm agreement between ENA 
 and each of these co's. 
 
 This specific sale will be papered under Nevada Power Co. so let's proceed 
 with that paper being the lead.
 
 I will review the confirm you sent, but re-issue under the premise that the 
 confirm is being raised to the new master. 
 
 Thanks.  BT
