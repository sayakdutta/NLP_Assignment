 Interesting.  I'll work with MKM and Maria on getting answers to AA's 
 questions and comments.  I think we can eliminate the specific cross 
 references between the two agreements, but is that the real problem or is AA 
 going to choke on our execution of both agreements with the same party?  
 (that's a tough one to wire around, if it is their real concern).  Thanks.  DF

 Stan asked that I forward our comments on to you regarding the TW Compression 
 Services Agreement and the Purchase and Sale Agreement.  If you would like to 
 discuss, we will be available early next week.  Thanks.

 Stan, attached is the latest draft of the compression services agreement 
 related to the TW compression monetization effort. Since you've reviewed it 
 last, nothing material has changed as you can see from the red-lined version. 
 We would like to file for regulatory approval soon. Pls let me know if you 
 have any questions - thanks.
  
  I'll send the updated PSA agreement in a separate Email.

 In case you didn't have this old message.  Below is the latest draft of the 
 Services Agreement.  I will also reforward to you the latest drafts/exhibits 
 of the Purchase and Sale Agreement.  Thanks, Maria

 Attached is a revised redlined draft of the above-referenced  Agreement which 
 incorporates comments from regulatory and Mike Bryant with V&E.  We have 
 added a new Appendix 1 to cover the Assets subject to this Agreement rather 
 than refer to the Exhibit in the Purchase and Sale, as well as an exclusivity 
 provision regarding use of the Assets.  We've also added a reference to the 
 arbitration section in the event the oversight committee cannot agree to 
 changes necessary or desirable to the assets.
