 Find enclosed a resume for this guy who wants to trade crude / products.  He 
 used to trade fx forwards for a few years and was profitable. He has been 
 trading energy  for last six months to an year. I know him some, and he seems 
 to have good trader sense. He is pretty hungry.  Just in case the 
 crude/products desk is looking !

 Good afternoon Harry,
 
 Thank you very much for returning my phone call so promptly.  I have
 attached my CV for your review.  I am quite excited to meet with you and any
 of your colleagues to discuss where I can best contribute to Enron.  Please
 feel free to give me a call if you have any further questions.  I am leaving
 slightly early this afternoon for Austin (Go Longhorns) but will obviously
 be back in the office Monday.  Have a super weekend.
 
 Best regards,
 
 David Kane
