 Attached are the results of the Balancing Test evaluation performed on
 October 25, 2001.  According to may paperwork, I should send the results
 back to Steve Olin but I cannot contact him therefore, I am contacting
 you with the results.
 
 I regret to inform you that Enron has unsuccessfully completed Balancing
 Test evaluation.
 
 Results are attached.
