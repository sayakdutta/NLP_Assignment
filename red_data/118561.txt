 
 I agree completely, have talked to the Mayors Office - Citizens' Assistance 
 Office, the Traffic & Transportation Dept. (who gave me Ms. Dorsey's name) 
 and have written to Ms. Dorsey.  I suggest you also complain to our City 
 Council member and the other at-large members.  Since Dorsey is the Bikeway 
 Coordinator, she won't have much incentive to do away with a designated 
 bikeway but Council members want our votes:
 

 Heights

 written to her




 
 The last 5 are "at-large" members of the council.  I got all of these from 
 the City web site so I can't be sure it's a current list.
 
 Another argument for two lanes on Heights is that with only one lane, some 
 percentage of traffic will divert itself to side streets making them less 
 safe for residents there.
 
 And p.s. the argument that this lane is designed for use by bicycle commuters 
 is particularly empty since the lane doesn't go anywhere - there's no 
 connecting route at either end that I am aware of - do they expect all these 
 hypothetical bicycle commuters to get on I 10?
