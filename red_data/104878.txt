 To whom should Risk Management & Trading Corp. ("RMT") direct the swap 
 confirmation related to RMT's hedge management fee with Enron Nordic Energy 
 (Norwegian branch of Enron Capital & Trade Resources International Corp.)?  
 The previous transaction was dated February 24, 1999 and requires amendment.
