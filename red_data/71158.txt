 and I need to gush about the IAOC.

 Kay,
 
 Since we can't seem to connect on the phone (a bit busy, are we?) I wanted 
 you to know I forwarded Paige's resume to the recruiting people.  They will 
 not start summer internship recruiting until late January/early Feb., so I'll 
 check back with them in a few weeks.
 
 Take care.  When are we going out for drinks?
 
 Heather
