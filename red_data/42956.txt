 
 The game was awesome.  Our tickets were directly behind homeplate.  Debbie 
 said she could see me on every pitch and knew that I left the bootom half of 
 the 8th inning.  She said I never picked my nose once on camera.  Pretty 
 good, huh.
 
 Have a good day.  Talk with you later.  By the way, your car is done.  They 
 had no problem removing the oil filter at all.  They only had to wriggle it a 
 little bit.
 
 Love, Daddy
