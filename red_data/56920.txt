 No problem, as long as the MBA program agrees to it.
 I need an E-mail from them.

  Dear Dr. Kaminski
 
  I am a post-doc in theoretical chemistry at Rice. Currently I am
 exploring risk management as an alternative career path. I hope you do not
 mind if I attend your course "Energy Derivatives" at Jones School of MGMT
 at Rice. I've already taken "Futures and options-I", "Corporate finance",
 and I am currently taking "Futures and options-II".
 
  Thanks.
 
  Sincerely,
  Konstantin Kudin
