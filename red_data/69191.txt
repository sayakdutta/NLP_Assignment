 Phillip, 
 
 I can reclass this to synthetic storage.  It looks like we may have netted 
 the pre-existing synthetic storage valance with some other variances and 
 taken it to the desk in the October,November time frame....

 Also, in 0006 theres is a synthetic deal identified as NN4016 with NNG for 
 $265K, this deal is in sitara 301891 under CPR Pipeline storage. The terms 
 match and we should have no variance.  Please ask Gas accounting why we do 
 not have a variance on synthetic line - probably Jim Pond.  Thanks.
