 
 Lisa,
 
 I've made some preliminary suggestions on the term sheet. We will have some 
 comments on the asset management attachment, but I don't have those together 
 yet.
 
 In looking through our files I don't find a confidentiality agreement.  
 Therefore, I'm attaching a draft of what we would like to have executed so 
 that we can send you other documents.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
