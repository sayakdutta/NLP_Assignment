 Jerry suggested a breakfast meeting the morning of October 12.  Will you be back in Houston in time for the Plan Review with Mr. Horton at 8:30 that morning?  Please see Kathy's note below suggesting a meeting prior to the Plan Review.
 
 Thanks, Tracy.

 Rod and Tracy:
 
 Would you be able to meet with Jerry before the Budget Meeting with Mr. Horton?  Jerry said that a breakfast meeting would work for him.  Please let me know at your earliest convenience.  FYI, Jerry will be staying at the Doubletree Hotel the night before (Oct. 11).
