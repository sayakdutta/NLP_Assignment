 currently taking to finalize.
 
 On a different matter, I spoke with Mike Neves on Friday afternoon and we 
 concluded that getting you hooked up to Lotus Notes was becoming too 
 complicated.  Please email your updates to me and I will enter onto Lotus 
 Notes.
 
 Thanks.  Sara
 
 P.S.  I have approved all of your invoices for payment.

 Sara,
 
 Where do we stand on the contractual issues associated with getting this 
 software installed on our desktops?  
 
 Thanks and regards,
 John
