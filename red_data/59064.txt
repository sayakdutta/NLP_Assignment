 Attached is Jim's prepared statement filed last night for today's House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee (Chairman Barton) hearing on reliability, transmission incentives and siting issues.  You will see we use the opportunity to make a plug for large RTOs as well.  Jim will actually deliver a five minute oral summary.  He is appearing as the EPSA witness in his capacity as chairman of the EPSA Regulatory Affairs Committee.  There will be ten witnesses on the panel.  Others will represent EEI, NARUC, APPA, LPPC, NRECA, NERC (David Cook), ELCON, Consumers for Fair Competition, and GF Energy.  We will provide a report following the hearing.
