 
 The position sheet from yesterday afternoon, close of business, is quite 
 different than the position posted in newcuurentday for 11/29.  What do you 
 think the difference is?  The SJ, Perm, and Socal don't match.  Are we 
 booking them correctly.  Let me know.  
 
 Ask Anne to reconcile each day with comments on the prompt tab.
 
 Thanks,
 Mike
