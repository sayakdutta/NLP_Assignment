 Stephanie,
 
 Can you please authorize my EOL account (ADM59501) so that I can transact internally with the following Tennessee Z-0 physical products:
 
 1) Next day gas
 2) Next day plus 1
 3) Balance of month physical
 
 All transactions should go to my physical book, ENA-IM-Katy.
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
 
 Thanks,
 
 Charlie Weldon
