 
 It will be fine to use current +1 as the cutoff.

 Just to clarify, its not the relative age of the production date, but the age 
 of the event itself.

 Do any of you see a problem with limiting this to the current month or 
 current month +1
 Need to know soon

 Scotty/Richard,
 
 Our DBAs would like to see what we can do to reduce the qty of rows in 
 Contract_Event_Status.  We have over 1 Gig of data in that table.  I would 
 like to suggest we have a nightly or weekly or monthly process to delete any 
 row with a Last_Mod_Date over a month (or two) old.  So if someone balances 
 February 1999 this month, we will keep it around for a month (or two).
 
 Does any one else have a desire to keep this data for a shorter/longer period 
 of time?
 
 This is not an audit table.  This is just a "log" every nom/track/balance/EDI 
 send/Fax send/sched qty/quick response since the beginning of time.
