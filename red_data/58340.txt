 
 Pete van de gohm suggested we might want to get something out on the mideast 
 situation as well -- a sort of travel advisory.  Please follow up with him.  
 I know that for our mideast project people we have been taking care of this 
 in David Haug's old organization.  See if there is anything else we need to 
 be doing.  Dennis Vegas may be able to provide you with a way to get the info 
 you need.

 Here is more on Colombia.  It emphasizes the 'take precautions' 
 recommendation.

 Mike - I've spoken to my contacts at State and
 Defense.  They both are saying that their people in
 Colombia are on high alert - no unnecessary travel,
 fully armored vehicles when available, changing time
 and routes, etc. - as they fully expect FARC and ELN
 to react violently to the initiation of US aid later
 this month.  They believe that the terrorists will go
 after easily recognizable but soft targets that are
 clearly American.  That pretty much means American
 corporations whose presence can be identified and who
 don't have visible security.  The Embassy understands
 that companies like Coca Cola have removed all expats.
  I asked if the Embassy officers have been able to
 move about the cities and they replied "Of course, but
 they don't do it as much as they did and are more
 careful now."  Cali and Medellin are regarded as more
 dangerous that Bogota and U.S. official travel to them
 is at a minimum. Travel in the countryside is
 absolutely forbidden except by helicopter.
 
 Hope this helps.  Let's face it, you can operate
 anywhere as long as you are careful... - Phil
