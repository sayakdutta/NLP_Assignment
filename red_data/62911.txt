 John,
   In an attempt to keep you informed, Gary Hickerson is bringing in a 
 gentleman by the name of Mark Slaughter to work on his desk in an 
 Agribusiness Consultant role.  Mark will be on contract for a 6 month period 
 and may be brought on full time pending his success.  His rate of pay is 
 equivalent to $80k annually.  If  Enron breaks the contract within three 
 months Mark will be paid a breakage fee of 20k.  If contract is broken after 
 three months Mark will be paid the amount remaining under his agreement.   If 
 Mark is hired full time during this contract there will be no associated fee 
 involved. 
 Feel free to contact me if there are any questions
