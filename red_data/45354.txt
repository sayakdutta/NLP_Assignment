 your does, though.  You haven't been having a good year.  I hope things 
 improve.

 Not terminal - at least I hope not!  I have a hiatus hernia which has been 
 giving me a lot of difficulties recently. I've been to hospital for a variety 
 of test; some not so yucky, so a it yucky (tubes down the nose and into the 
 stomach!). I'm seeing my specialist tomorrow to get all the results and 
 determine a suitable course of action - I'm getting a bit fed up swallowing 
 pills that aren't really doing that much anyway.  I'll keep you updated - but 
 don't worry I'll be back on full form in the hopefully not too distant 
 future. Edmund
 
 
 
    
  
 Edmund,
 
 I heard yesterday you have been out for quite a while sick.  I had no idea.  
 What's the scoop?  Should I be worried?
