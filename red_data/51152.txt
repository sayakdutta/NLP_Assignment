 Vince:
  This is regarding Puneet Mathur who we interviewed last week and decided to 
 make an offer to join the Retail research team. I called him to inquire about 
 his current compensation. His current base salary is $115,000 with a minimum 
 bonus of 20%. His last pay raise and bonus were in September 1999 and he is 
 expecting a raise and a bonus this September. The offer we would like to give 
 him ($85-90K base) is obviously way below his expectations. And I don't see 
 how we can offer him what he expects from us ($125K base - on par with mine), 
 as it would be placing him well above Ronnie & Osman who are definitely more 
 experienced and, in my view, more qualified. Let me know what to do.
 
 Thanks,
 Krishna.
