 A fact is this summer the NE never got very hot.  Therefore the 
 Great Lakes didn't heat up as much as normal. Argument is then that 
 the cool fronts might be colder to the NE actual temps b/c of winds off 
 the colder Lakes.  
 Does the lake affect snow theory cover this or would this be the infamous
 Shively Windchill Effect I used to hear so much about when on Central ??
 May be the reverse will happen, please enlighten me if you know something...
 
 It might be interesting to take a look at the historical water temps. of great
 lakes historical vs current year, may be the Enron depth of research can 
 investigate.
 
 Here is the link, I haven't had the time to do it yet....
