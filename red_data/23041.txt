 RE:  2001 Spring Meeting in Philadelphia
 
 
 Attached is the agenda for the upcoming Spring meeting in Philadelphia.  The
 Executive Committee has worked hard to develop a program that we anticipate
 will
 be lively and informative.  One of the highlights is the Thursday afternoon
 panel of Washington experts discussing the new political environment, as
 well as
 legislation and policy initiatives that we should be aware of.
 
 If you have not done so already, please let us know if you plan on attending
 the
 Spring meeting by responding to this e-mail.
 
 If you have any questions about the program or the meeting in general please
 call either Ann Linnehan at (203) 351-6113 or Emily Ward at (404) 249-2717.
 
 I look forward to seeing all of you in Philadelphia.
