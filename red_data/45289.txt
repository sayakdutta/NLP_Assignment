 
 On the referenced list, Credit shows River Trading Company as an amended 
 counterparty, but I didn't have them at all so I treated them like a new 
 counterparty.
 
 On the 8/8/00 List, Braintree is a division, and I would like it to read:  
 City of Braintree, Massachusetts Electric Light Department.
 the name on Spinnaker is wrong, Credit will be correcting it to read 
 Spinnaker Exploration Company L.L.C.
