 match?

 Enron Golfers:
 
 Hey guys, Sarah Edwards is a friend of a friend's daughter who desperately 
 needs help to stay alive and all you duffers out there can help:
 
 The 100 holes for golf for Sarah Edwards will be Monday June 4 at
 Sweetwater CC. Sarah needs a lung transplant and
 approximately $150,000 of the costs are not covered by insurance or
 medicaid.  
 
 For more info on Sarah, visit Sarahssoldiers.com 
 
 Here is how the 100 holes for golf works:
 
 *Free golf at Sweetwater
 *You play as many holes as you can (100 is not mandatory)
 * We provide your lunch, drinks and snacks
 * You get pledges from your friends to play
 *pledges may be flat amounts, per hole, per birdie or per eagle
 
 Lets all keep Sarah alive! Can I get some other tentative commitments?
 
 thanks!
