 reacting poorly, swift action is warranted.  If there's anything I can do to 
 help, don't hesitate. Hang in there.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Thanks Jeff-
 I really appreciate the talk and your perspective. 
 I'm still undecided about school, still need to have
 the talk with my contact guy at eLoyalty.  Planning on
 that for Friday.  No decisions, lots of open emotional
 stuff going on.  I would like to grab lunch or
 whatever at some point, but not in the real near
 future...I've got to settle my schedule a bit or I'm
 going to literally pass out.  My body is reacting to
 the abuse quite badly.  Maybe if I get back on the
 beach in a week or two!  Anyway-talk to you later and
 thanks again-
