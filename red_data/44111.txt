 As far as providing the purchase order number, should we send that to P. O.
 Box 4428, Attn:  Client Services since it won't be on the contract?

 Is Janet Wallis' address P. O. Box 4428, Houston, TX 77210-4428?  Could you
 also provide her physical address in the event we send the agreements by
 courier?  Thanks!
 
 
     
 
 Christian,
      I spoke with Janet Wallis this morning and she said she was fine with
 the redlined changes.  Accordingly, please print 2 originals of the
 contract, have it signed and forward both signed contracts to Janet Wallis
 for ENA's signature.

 Christian,
      The below documents has been modified in the manner that you
 suggested.  Please make sure that the Purchase Order Number is communicated
 to all parties in writing prior to the end of the month if it is to be
 used.  The red line should reflect  the changes that you have  been
 requesting.  By copy I am requesting Janet Wallis to review the suggested
 changes and to communicate directly with you if she approves such changes.
 If she notifies you that the changes are okay, then you may print 2
 originals of the clean document and have it signed by CPS and forward to
 Janet for signature by ENA.  Do not hesitate to call if you have any
 questions.   My phone number is (713) 853-6895.
