 meeting from Tuesday evening (Sept. 12) through Friday (Sept. 15).  If you 
 were to arrive early enough on Tuesday, we could try to do the review before 
 I catch the plane on Tuesday afternoon.  The only problem with that is that 
 the VP/MD PRC is scheduled for September 11 and 12.  I don't know that the VP 
 portion of the PRC will be completed on Monday, or that the results would be 
 available to me on Tuesday even if the process is completed on Monday.  We 
 have been asked to hold VP reviews until after the PRC process is completed.  
 
 I will contact you as soon as I do have the results from the PRC and we will 
 set up a specific time for the review, either in Houston or Calgary.  Seems 
 like it would be a good time of year for me to head north!  --Sally

 Will you have time to complete my performance review while I am in Houston 
 next week?  I will be in the office on the afternoon of September 13th and 
 would like to set aside some time on my calendar if you are available.  Can 
 you let me know what time works best for you?  Another option would be to 
 schedule some time after the VAR class training which goes until 5:00 pm on 
 Thursday and Friday.  Please let me know your preference.
 Thanks
 Peggy
