   schematic
 
 In advance of the video conference tomorrow amongst the Houston and London 
 personnel involved in the Pulp & Paper deals, I now attach a final draft 
 version of a "schematic" which sets down the trade flow structure on the 
 deals sourced by EEFT for ECTRIC.  If you have any comments on this, please 
 let me know.
 
 Sara / Carol / Dale:  Please see fit to let any other appropriate personnel 
 in Houston have a copy of this document at your discretion.
 
 Kind regards
 
 Mark
