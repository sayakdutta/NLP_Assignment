 
 I don't envy your position.  At some point, the document must be finished and 
 folks need to determine whether they'll sign or not.  I greatly admire Rich 
 Gilbert, but his comments (re: regulatory intervention is a good thing, and 
 now this one) will surely create considerably controversy and could greatly 
 upset the apple cart altogether.
 
 Best of luck,

 Talked to Tyson.  She's really working it, which is great, and I continue to 
 focus my efforts there.  My company is squarely behind her efforts.  Thanks 
 again for organizing the meeting last weekend.

 One more thing:
 
 No one talked about bailing out consumers when retail prices were above
 spot prices (by about $40/MWh by my calculation) in the 2+ years
 following deregulation.  Surely, if we bail out
 the utilities by raising prices now, consumers should be credited for the
 above-market prices that they paid in the past.
