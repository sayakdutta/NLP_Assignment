 
 Good question.  I'll ask around.
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 

   
  
 By the way, I have the original LCs from GE for the LMs. Should the originals 
 go to you? If not, to whom?

 I have a conflict.  How about 300?

 Hi Ben,
 
 I got an opinion from outside counsel.  I'll give it a look so we can 
 discuss.  I'll move it up on the list.

 We really need to get on top of the situation with the 501D5A. I believe SW 
 is now taking the position that the generator was delivered under the terms 
 of the contract, and risk of loss resided with us at the time of the "event". 
 I furthermore understand they are taking the position that if we want a 
 replacement generator, that we need to execute a change order. Kind of makes 
 you feel like you're getting squeezed...
 
 At the end of the day, we've got $25 million in a CT without a generator. ENA 
 will get saddled with these costs if we do not find a resolution either 
 through a buyer or a settlement with SW.
 
 I really hope we can focus on this in the next couple of days. FYI, both 
 Chris Booth and Ron Tapscott have been drafted on this effort. 
 
 Thanks,
 
 Ben
