 I reviewed the ECT confirmation templates today and found that a reference is 
 made to a telephone conversation on most of the templates for transactions 
 under a ECT Master Agreement. 
 
 The offending sentence is as follows:
 
 "This is a confirmation of the following Transaction entered into with you 
 pursuant to a telephone conversation on <<DealDate>> between the parties:"
 
 I would like to change it to read as follows, with your approval:
 
 "This is a confirmation of the following Transaction entered into between us 
 on  <<DealDate>>:"
 
 
 This change will allow the current templates to handle both telephone and 
 internet trading.
 
 Please advise.
