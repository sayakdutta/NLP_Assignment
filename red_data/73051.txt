 Ok, I'll mark you out then.

 Let's just assume I'll be out Friday afternoon.
 
 
    
  
 I'm sure he gets that from you.  He'll be fine, just get him the help that he 
 needs.  Let me know about Friday when you decide.

 I suspect that there are several options.
 
 He is such a sweet, cute, smart thing.  You will like him. He is very very 
 charming.
 
 
    
  
 He can be helped though right?  Block out Friday afternoon?

 We've known, but is has gotten to be a bigger issue as he has gotten older.
 
 
    
  
 Are you just finding out?  I know there are things that can be done to help 
 that situation.  Do you want me to block you out for Friday afternoon as 
 well.  You need to get this taken care of quickly for Michael's sake.

 Michael problems. He has ADD and some other lesser learning problems.  We are 
 going to meet  with the specialist next week.
 
 I'm going to try to take off Friday afternoon as well.  We are thinking of 
 changing his school, and Neil and I need to go visit a new one.
 
 HECTIC!
 
 
    
  
 Are you ok?

 Please protect Thursday afternoon, August 10th for me.  I have some important 
 personal stuff to take care of.
