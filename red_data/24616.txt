 What's up? Good to hear from you. I am very happily back in Calgary. Things at Enron are totally fucked up right now. Not really sure how it is going to play out. Anyway life goes on. Tell D'arcy I made less than 10 million last year. Take it easy and I'll right more later.

 Hey Chris,
 
 How are you doing?  How are things at Enron.  I was shocked to see the stock
 price today.
 
 Are you back in Calgary or still in Houston?
 
 Let me know, are you coming to visit.  Do I have stories for you!!!
 
 Speak to you soon,
