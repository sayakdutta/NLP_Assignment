 to review the ETA for trading on the Dynegy Website.  I told her we were 
 meeting to develop a policy about the opening of such websites, that we had 
 no board resolutions passed allowing the opening of them, nor do we have 
 control procedures in place about where statements go, etc., so we can 
 control and prevent "rogue" trading.  She said before she sent this out she 
 would contact you.
