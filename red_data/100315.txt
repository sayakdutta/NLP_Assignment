 law degree (ahem!).
 I agree it would be risky to indicate our wholehearted support of a 
 settlement when the agreement has yet to be written.  It would be like giving 
 SoCal a signed blank check (that's carte blancheto us lawyers), and we don't 
 trust them that much.
 Once we've signed a real agreement, I do want to file something in support.  
 I'm just trying to plan ahead, is all.
 
 
 
 
 

   
  
 OK, you folks are getting antsy out there.  I haven't yet begun to think 
 about a declaration.  And don't plan on thinking about one until 1) the 
 Commission has approved the motion, and 2) Socalgas shows during the first 
 week or so that it intends to faithfully put into details what it has agreed 
 to in principal.  Also, if the motion is approved, the hearing likely won't 
 happen on the 11th (one would hope).
 
 Am I missing something?  Are you folks concerned about something that I'm 
 missing?
