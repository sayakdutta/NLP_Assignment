 
 Brett,
 
 I think Friday is perfect.  I will confirm which is the final version, and 
 send to you and John.

 Kay:
 
 I am out of the office today.  Can we do it tomorrow?  Can you or someone 
 else forward to me the final version of the documents?  I would like to take 
 a final look either tonight or early in the morning.
 
 John:  Do you have any final comments?
 
 Thanks,
 Brett

 Lee Johnson would like to come in tomorrow or Friday to sign the Facility 
 Agreement.  Are we ready to go?  He really wants to get this done before the 
 holidays.
 
 Thanks,
