 Kay,
 
 I have reviewed the proposed change with our management, and we may be able
 to close this out.  For clarification purposes, please review the attached
 document, in which I have incorporated your changes as proposed on 10/9/01.
 The changes were made to the version you sent back to Siemens Westinghouse
 on 10/01/01.  If we both agree that this version is accurate, please advise
 and we will begin the execution process on our end.
 
 I look forward to hearing from you.

 Hi Ann,
 
 Thank you for your response. I wanted to propose some different language
 for your consideration:
 
 WHEREAS, the Gleason Project sustained damage to its exhaust stacks and
 alleged that Siemens Westinghouse was responsible for such damage
 because (i) of its failure to, among other things, provide drawings with
 adequate directions for the welding of those stacks and (ii) excessive
 vibrations at the Gleason Plant were a contributing factor to such
 damage.  As a result, Enron presented a breach of warranty claim to
 Siemens Westinghouse, in May of 2001, under the Contract in the amount
 of Four Hundred Nine Thousand, Six Hundred Sixty-Six Dollars
 ($409,666.00) for repair work performed on two of the stacks ("Warranty
 Issue").
 
 I hope this gets us there.  
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
 
 
     
 
 
 Kay:
 
 We are in receipt of Enron's proposed changes to the Settlement
 Agreement
 and Release on the Gleason Project.  Unfortunately, it appears that the
 intent of the Settlement Agreement has strayed away from initial
 discussions
 between our respective business representatives.   In past discussions
 with
 Enron regarding its claim for costs associated with reconstruction of
 the
 Gleason CT exhaust stacks, Enron tied its local low frequency noise
 concerns
 to the stack reconstruction issue.  Although the causes for
 reconstruction
 of the stacks were beyond SWPC responsibilities, SWPC agreed that in the
 interest of continued customer relations, we would be willing to make a
 business policy concession to Enron on the reconstruction costs in
 exchange
 for indemnification on future stack and noise issues. 
 
 The latest revisions to the Settlement Agreement deletes any references
 to
 the noise issues in the warranty definition, thereby eliminating any
 coverage for indemnification for future claims which may arise on that
 issue
 from the Settlement Agreement.  This elimination substantially erodes
 the
 value of Enron's indemnification, and the settlement overall.  As
 modified,
 the deal is no longer palatable to SWPC, and it is in our best interest
 not
 to enter into the Agreement as proposed by Enron.  Should Enron be
 willing
 to re-insert the language struck from the third WHEREAS paragraph, SWPC
 would be willing to sign on to the deal.
 
 Please contact me directly if you wish to discuss this further.  SWPC
 would
 like to resolve all outstanding issues with Enron, but we will not make
 payment on a claim for an issue which we believe we bear no
 responsibility
 unless such payment is part of a more global settlement.

 Hi Ann,
 
 I'm attaching a redline with just a couple of changes to the draft you
 sent.  Hopefully, we can wrap this up.
 
 Thanks,
