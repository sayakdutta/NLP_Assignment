 
 First order of business.  Again, we can discuss this on Monday.
 
 I think Ben (or one of his minions) called Carolyn and asked her to be on a 
 telephone call today.  I have reacted with righteous indignation, and Carlos 
 is going to tell her it is not necessary for her to be on the call.  I really 
 hadn't intended for Carolyn to work on this transaction.  
 
 Talk to you Monday.

 NorthWestern has agreed to our request to remove the Corp guarantee from the 
 letter.  We will change the dash to reflect the change.

 Ben and Chris,
 
 Attached is the revised Exclusivity Letter Agreement, black-lined to reflect
 the changes agreed upon this afternoon.  Your timely efforts to move this
 along for approval and execution within Enron is greatly appreciated.  I
 look forward to hearing your comments soon.  Regards.
