 
 There are two lawsuits against ECT pending in LA dictrict court in 
 California.The plaintiffs are Legg Mason and Farrallon. They did not give us 
 releases. The other plaintiffs have either given us releases or decided not 
 to sue us(the statute of limitations has probably already run as well) I will 
 be happy to answer any other questions.

 Hi Mary - Do you know where we stand on the release of the orginal lawsuits 
 that were filed against ECT Securities and the other underwriters regarding 
 NSM?  We put out a Watch Report for Merchant assets and I've sort of referred 
 to that issue with a generic comment like  "Negotiations continue regarding 
 obtaining releases from the lawsuits that were filed against the original 
 underwriting group that included ECT Securities."
 
 If memory serves me correctly, there was one release that was granted - 
 either from Farrallon Capital Mgmt, or Oaktree?  Do you know how many others 
 are outstanding.
 
 Please let me know at your convenience.
 
 Thnx,
