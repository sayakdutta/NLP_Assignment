 meeting I hope.  DF
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 

  
  
 I have included Drew's recommendations and have amended the 11/6/2000 drafts 
 of the ETS Risk Policy and Risk Procedure.  The significant change made was 
 to take out references to Hedging and Non-Hedging Transactions (II A. & B. 
 have been taken out).  We will just call them all Derivative Transactions.  I 
 would like Tony Pryor to arrange a meeting with all parties to move these 
 documents forward, an alternative is to continue to use the Corporate Risk 
 Management Policy and just set the trading limits as part of the Corporate 
 Policy. 
 
 Cassandra Schultz in RAC has not responded to the policy and I plan to 
 follow-up with her after we meet to discuss.
