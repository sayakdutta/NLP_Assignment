 
 I will not be able to play golf or party.  I was really wanting to go, but 
 can't make it.

 Talked to Gary this morning...
 
 We need a head count...
 
 We are planning to have a golf outing the day of the party...so I need to
 know if you are going to play golf, play golf and party or just party....
 
 Please respond as soon as possible so we can make sure Gary has the time of
 his life!!
 
 thanks,
 
 Jeff
