 
 I'd like to have access, but I don't have access to "O" drive.  Can that be rectified, or is that beyond your role?

 Hello everyone!
 The purpose of this e-mail is to tell you about a new program which we are rolling out that will benefit the ENTIRE ENRON HR COMMUNITY.
 It is called the HR Warehouse.
 It is a collection of folders located on the O Drive  which have been set up to increase communication between the various BUs' HR groups.
 The idea was born out of our experiences in the HR Forum, where various members of the Enron HR community would share ideas, goings on, etc.
 The primary goal is to increase efficiency.  Why re-create the wheel when it is already on the road elsewhere?
 We all have a variety of programs, processes, forms, etc. which we use in our daily work life.
 Through this repository, you can now share your ideas with others, and put their ideas to work for you.
 Also, there is a parking lot for HR related questions, where you will be able to get answers/ advice for whatever problems/ issues you are dealing with.
 The document below is the framework for this program.
 The only way this will be effective, however, is for people to use it!
 I am in the process of setting up security access for these folders, and need your assistance.
 Can you please e-mail me a list of EE's who you feel would benefit from the HR Warehouse (actually, everyone could, but we need to restrict access!).
 Also, if you have any suggestions or feedback, please let me know. 
 Thank you!
 
 Sunjay
