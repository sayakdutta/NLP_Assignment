 Audrey is our secretary.  Her phone number is X35849.  I wasn't aware that she books 49C2, but give her a call and see what she says.
 
 Happy Thanksgiving.  Kim.

 	Kim -- Do you know someone named Audrey Robertson?  She books the 49/C2 room.  I need to know if someone 
 	turned in a purse and a briefcase this morning (left there).  And, if not, who booked that room after Stan's 8 am -9:30 
 	staff meeting was over.
 
 	(I've tried to call her; got her no. from Cindy Stark, but no answer.  I don't know if she is in today or not.  I went up to 
 	49/C2 and no purse or briefcase is there.  Yes -- I am losing it!)
 
 	--Dot
