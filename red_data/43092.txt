 that would be appreciated.  I would think we might want to discuss it at the 
 Board meeting prior to setting up another meeting with EEI.  What do you 
 think?  I can see pros and cons of meeting with EEI prior to the next Board 
 meeting.
 
 Depending on the strawman I feel we are beginning to lose key support from 
 the Board to work this matter.  Bill we need to get the Board to continue to 
 follow him if we are to make progress.
