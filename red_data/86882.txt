 After thinking about it and talking with other P&Z members, I think we can suggest some more ideas to Dan Muniza on the outdoor seating area.  Since the restaurant does not need the entire area, maybe they could use the front part or the middle part.  If they used the middle part, we could reclaim the front and back and put plantings and/or suitable trees.  Also, Dora suggested they use some kind of decking instead of concrete.  Maybe when P&Z meets again we can flesh out some of these ideas.  Next time you talk with Dan, please mention using only a part of the area.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Susan
