 
 Toni,
 
 I would like to bring two people for an interview 
 
 One of them sent me a message that is attached below.
 I am including the info about the 2nd gentleman below.
 
 I would like to include myself, Vasant Shnabhogue, Tanya Tamarchenko
 Stinson Gibner, Zimin Lu, Paulo Issler,  Alex Tang on the interview list.
 
 It would be great if we could bring them this week on Friday. Tanya
 will be at a training course next week. This means that if Friday this week 
 is too aggressive,
 we should shoot for interviews in 2 weeks.
 
 Sorry for a short notice.
 
 Vince

 Dear Vince:
 
 How are you? I am not sure whether you still remember
 me, we met in a conference last year in Houston. After
 having been working for Williams for about two years,
 now I am ready to make a move. I have heard Enron is a
 great company, I am wondering whether there is any
 opportunity for me, either in research group or in
 structure group
 
 Here is brief description about myself: Right after I
 got my Ph.D. on finance and econometrics from Duke
 University in 1998, I joined Williams Energy Trading
 company as a Quantitative Analyst. Now I am Lead Quant
 and in charge of the quantitative research group with
 7 highly talented people. I have done extensive
 research and modeling about electricity,
 load-following deal and tolling deals.
 
 If you need any additional information, please feel
 free to call me at 918-409-4308. I look forward to
 hearing from you soon, thank you.
 
 sincerely,
 Charles
