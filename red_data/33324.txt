 For gas day 5/7/02, Cinergy/Apache moved 10,000 dth from Sid Rich Cayanosa to Oasis Mi Vida.  Oasis Mi Vida is not a Lone Star point but I didn't know it at the time and I sold the gas to TXU at $3.20.  No sales were made for 5/8/02.

 Sold TXU 10,000 dth of Cayanosa for 5/1/02 at $3.45.  I actually sold TXU the gas yesterday and I didn't want to change the volumes for the 1st.  Let me know if you want to sell more than 10,000 for the 2nd.
 
 Thanks
