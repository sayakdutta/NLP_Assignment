 
 We can do that.  Brian, would you mail Don a copy of the CGAS and CGLF 
 invoices for January?  We will take care of everything else.
 
 thanks
 
 
 
 
 





  
 
 Can you send a copy to me and one to Don.
 
 Thanks - Charlie
 
 
 
 


 


   
 
 
 Don Kirkendahl (in your Houston office 713-350-8445) contacted me yesterday.  
 He
 is requesting copies of the transport invoices.  Should I give the invoices to
 him or should I send them to Charlie?
