 The Magistrad Worm
 
     Systems affected: PCs with Windows 95/98/ME, Windows NT/2000 with poor
 security
 
     Method of propagation:  E-mail attachment; when opened it attaches
 itself to Windows executable files and sends itself to e-mail recipients.
 It can grab e-mail recipient addresses from Outlook, Outlook Express,
 Netscape and/or Microsoft Internet Mail and News.
 
     Risk to the Rice campus:  High. It spreads quickly, and it can damage
 or destroy files and damage the system BIOS. It does not attack document
 files specifically.
 
 Hi again, it's Rick Russell your local virus guy. Two e-mail messages to
 ALLDEPTS this morning contained this vicious virus. The virus affects PC
 systems with Windows 9X/NT/2000, not Macs or UNIX systems.
 
 For all the details, visit:
 
    http://www.rice.edu/Computer/Computing/Virus/magistr.htm
 
 This virus does not execute unless you open the attached files. So, if you
 didn't open the attachments, you're fine. If you did and you're using a PC
 system with some version of Windows, please contact IT staff for help
 immediately. Contact information is included on the above web page.
 
 Please do NOT open attachments without confirming their validity.
 Confirmation might include a second e-mail with an exact description of
 the attachment contents (including file names and sizes), a telephone
 call, or a face-to-face meeting. NEVER open attachments with EXE in the
 filename.
 
 Please do not distribute this e-mail outside the Rice community, or
 forward it after June 15, 2001.
 
 Yours truly,
 
 ** Rick Russell, IT Consulting Specialist
