 
 Sorry for the confusion, Sharen. I checked with the traders, and found that 
 Deal #458391 does NOT need to be confirmed per Paul Choi in Mid-Marketing, 
 who entered the deal with Valley Electric.
 
 Deal #457963 DOES need to be confirmed. It was a trader mistake.
 
 Thanks, 
 Kate
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
   
  
 These two deals were input as not to be confirmed.  They look like they 
 should be confimed to me.  If they do not need to be confirmed, please put 
 the reason in the comments in deal entry.  Otherwise, please change to be 
 confirmed and let me know.
 
 Thanks!
