 
 Bill, FYI.  You have both David Porter and me working on that day shift.  
 Either we need to let the night shift know that they need to come in an hour 
 and a half early, put someone else on that day shift, or change the 
 itenerary.  Let me know when you have this resolved.  Thank you for your 
 attention to this matter.
