 
 Here are the home games when Meagan will be dancing in the half-time routine:
 
  Friday, September 15  7:00 pm
 
  Saturday, October 14  7:00 pm
 
  Friday, October 20  7:00 pm  (homecoming) 
 
 There is a chance that she could be added to two other home games if 
 alternates are needed.  Nothing definitive on that, of course.  She did get 
 put into a routine last year as an alternate, but you never know.  
 
 We would love for you to come for a visit this fall, and it would be fun if 
 it would work around one of these games.  I have also given this schedule to 
 Cindy, as she and Brigeda were interested in making it to a game.  
 
 I am headed to Dallas early tomorrow morning.  Patti has sent you a copy of 
 my itinerary.
