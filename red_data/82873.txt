 I have attached a list of Enron's Top Trading customers who are not doing 
 business on EOL.  Customers designated as Execute are signed up on EOL and 
 can begin transacting if they have suitable credit.  Please circulate this 
 list to your team to push some of these counterparties to begin using 
 EnronOnline.  If you have any questions, feel free to contact either myself 
 or Bryan Hull.  Thanks for your help.
