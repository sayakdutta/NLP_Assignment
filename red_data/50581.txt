 We have done a lot of work in this area. I shall call you later

 some recommendations.

 Vince,
 
 The Sydney office is currently evaluating a proposal that involves an option 
 to participate in building a wind farm. Should this proceed, we would like to 
 mark this option "to market".
 
 Have the Research group completed any work on methods for booking and 
 remarking real options? Alternatively, do you have any suggestions as to the 
 best way to value, and book, real options fairly?
 
 Regards
 Paul Smith
