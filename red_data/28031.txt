 volumes away from Cunningham?  Thanks.  DF

 If someone tries to nominate POI 61243 they will receive a message saying 
 "Invalid point".  The market service rep will then notify me because they 
 cannot nominate on the point.  I will then notify Jan.  Jan and I will notify 
 Sue, Morgan, Kent and yourself.  Let me know if we need to change anything.

 Jan and  Linda, the issue is how does anyone know for last years base gas 
 deal if it has "gone physical" (if Sempra nominates the SF agreement for 
 delivery).  My answer subject to your verification is that the POI that they 
 have to nominate to is flagged as not available, so when they nominate Market 
 Services is aware of it and is to call Kent/Sue/Morgan.  Could you fill in 
 any missing details.  Thanks, Dari
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
   
  
 They nominate the SF to market services also, in addition to any transport 
 they have?  Dari, please follow up on this with market services and verify 
 what the procedures are and let us all know.    Again, this may relate to a 
 counterproposal we make to TCEM if they barf on the corporate guarantee 
 issue, so time is of the essence.  Thanks.  DF

 addition to my first reply:
 
 Also, Sempra does not nominate to Kent/Sue/Morgan.  They nominate to Market 
 Services.  Sempra's scheduler would not even think to call any one of us.  We 
 would only hope their deal maker, David Otte, would be in the loop on their 
 side and notify one of us if they ever decided to go physical.
