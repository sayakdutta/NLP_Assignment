 price for a reference entity's credit online (i.e. in a nearly public manner) 
 vs. providing a price quote to customers who request it.  The almost public 
 nature of the marketing  may influence whether or not the reference entity is 
 happy with Enron trading the product.  Even if they are not affected in this 
 way, having given them notice in advance will at least give us moral high 
 ground if the reference entity later decides to object.

 Remove all references to EnronOnline its unnecessary in this context - 
 suffice to say you will be trading through all the normal Enron methods.

 Attached is the letter that we intend to send to CFO/Treasurers of reference 
 credits.  The section on EnronOnline was recommended by Sullivan and Cromwell 
 and reviewed by Goddard, Dilworth and Simons.
 
 
 
 There may be a few minor edits before it goes out.
 
 Thanks
