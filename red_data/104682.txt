 Thanks Jason,
 
 How long has this request been in Clements hands, that group has a
 tendency
 to have a slow response time.  Is there no other way we can proceed with
 execution of the document while we wait on the Guaranty?  Also, Midcoast
 has been transacting at the parent level (Midcoast Energy Resources) and
 these trades will need to be assigned to Midcoast Marketing under the
 new
 ISDA.  I think it would be a good idea to prepare assignment documents
 as
 well to have the trades moved. Please let me know your thoughts.
 
 Thanks.
 Russell

 I'm waiting on Clement Abrams response to one comment on the Guaranty.
 everything else is finalized.
 
 
     
 
 Jason,
 
 Please let me know the status of this ISDA.
 
 Thanks
 Russell

 Jason,
 
 I talked to MidCoast today about their collateral threshold, we have
 agreed
 to give them a $2MM threshold, I cannot remember off hand what I gave
 them
 originally, but this is the new amount.
 
 Let me know if you have any questions.
 
 Thanks
