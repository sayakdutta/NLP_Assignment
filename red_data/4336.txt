 
 Well I am looking for 24 Round trip tickets (48 one-ways)  and was looking to 
 spend around $200 per round trip ($100 for each one-way).  What is your offer 
 on that size?  
 
 Thanks for you PROMPT attention because I am trying to book airfare today on 
 one airline or another.
 
 
 
 
 
 

    
 
 Let's put it like this: How many do you want and at what price are you
 willing to pay?
