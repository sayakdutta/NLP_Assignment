 
 Happy Valentine's Day to you too!  And I'm not antiromantic...I'm just not as 
 romantic as some people.  It could be worse.  I could be like my mom...she's 
 less romantic than me.  
 
 Tambien te quiero MUcho.

 Happy Valentine's Day. 
 
 I do not need a day like this to be romantic with an antiromantic person, but 
 I just wanted to let you know that 
 TE QUIERO MUCHO.
