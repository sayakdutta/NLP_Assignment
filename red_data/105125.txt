 
 I am forwarding to you several e-mails received today regarding this 
 transaction.  We are going to send out another draft confirmation for this 
 commodity spread swaption.  Sara

 Dale/Bart/Sara,
 
 We need to clean up the confirmation and any other legal information that 
 accompanies it (Bart/Sara, is the attached Omnibus T&Cs we proposed to use 
 standard documentation or are any revisions necessary prior to sending out to 
 CCSI?) so that we can send this out to CCSI for their review.
 
 Looking at the confirmation, I see the following items that need to be 
 revised:
 
 Trade date/Signing date - Not yet confirmed; will insert date the deal is 
 closed when it is known.
 Need to specify which curve to look at in the Gas Daily Index (there is a low 
 high and a mid or average); we did not specify which one we would refer to 
 previously
 Do we need to replace ECT with ENA throughout??
 Catalytica should be Catalytica Combustion Systems (the subsidiary not the 
 parent)
 Need to add in details about CCSI (name/title/payment account info etc.)
 
 
 Sean - I will get the info for 5 from CCSI
 
 Dale - Could you correct number 2, advise on number 3 and review the document 
 again to see if any other information is lacking that should be included?
 
 Bart/Sara  - Could you advise about the details on the Omnibus (I have 
 misplaced any copy of this)  I thought there were some credit issues that 
 needed to be filled in at the bottom of this?
 
 If anyone else could advise on other items that need to be addressed with 
 either the Confirmation and/or the Omnibus agreement, now is the time!
 
 Regards,
