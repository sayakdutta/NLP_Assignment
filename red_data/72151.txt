 Kay:  We will do a fatal flaw review and follow up.  I am following up with 
 the lawyer in our CT office who I had talked to initially.  I hope that all 
 is well.  It sure sounds like you all are just buried.  Speak to you soon.

 Hi John,
 
 I still need a Connecticut lawyer to look at this.  Do you have someone
 available?  I need input by Monday, March 19. Nothing comprehensive, just a
 fatal flaw analysis under Connecticut law.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay

 Hi John,
 
 I'm attaching the current draft of the contract under which we will be able
 to buy the Fuel Cell equipment for use on projects in Connecticut.  The
 contract will likely be a Connecticut law contract.  Could you have someone
 give it a fatal flaw check, or should I use Connecticut counsel?
 
 One issue which is nagging me is their request for a security interest in
 the equipment, as I think this might complicate financing.  I assume that
 an equipment supplier has certain lien rights under Connecticut law anyway.
 Can you have this verified?  I only want the simplest of explanations.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
