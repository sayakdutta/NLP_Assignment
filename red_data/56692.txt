 Dear Vince,
 
 Thank you for a stimulating presentation about real options at the IIR
 conference in New York on Monday the 13th of December. Your explanation of 
 real
 options and it's applications for a number of valuation problems interested me
 very much. With reference to our previous conversation I wonder if it is
 possible  for you to forward the slides from the presentation.
 
 Thank you very much for your help
 
 Regards
 
 Erik
