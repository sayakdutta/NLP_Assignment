 
 Brian,
 
 Everything was fine with the file.  From now on could you please divide it 
 into three separate files?  I've attached the files that I loaded for the 
 17th, so if you just keep the same name (just update the date everyday) that 
 would help me a lot.   As for the master deal id, as long as they are all 
 unique what you had was fine.
 
 If you have any more questions just give me a call.
 
 
 
 Thanks,
 Robin
