 As referenced in my email Friday, we have scheduled the conference call for
 10 am (PST) on Tuesday, March 6.  The dial-in number is 1-800-210-5603
 (5047289#).  The 10 am start time is a change from our initial plan, given

 (PST).
 
 My suggested agenda is as follows:
 
  1.   MDL Status and Schedule  (Greg Copeland, Brady Edwards)
 
  2.  Status of SD Cases
 
   2.1   Motion to stay; ex-parte application
 
   2.2   Status of Gas Cases (Doug Tribble)
 
   2.3   Sweetwater removal
 
   2.4   Preparation for March 26 hearing
 
  3.  Status of SF Cases
 
   3.1  Motion to stay  (McCutchen)
 
   3.2  Remand motion -  opposition briefing due March 16
