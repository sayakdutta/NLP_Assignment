 Has anyone checked on whether there are any IT contracts and if so what the 
 contract # is?  
 If not, I will...just let me know.

 Attached is a draft letter requesting that PG&E provide Transwestern with 
 assurance of creditworthiness under Section 13 of TW's tariff.  Shelley and 
 Mike have reviewed this already and wanted to get input from the rest of you 
 as soon as possible.  Note that there are a couple of questions for us to 
 answer before we send it out.  I would like to  have this ready for Shelley 
 and Rod to run by Rick Buy, Steve Kean, and others as necessary by COB.  
 Thanks.  DF
