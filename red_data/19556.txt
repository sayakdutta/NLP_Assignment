 
 It was good to see you.  No thanks needed.  I'm pretty sure that I can get you the info on the plants--it's in the contracts and I'm fairly certain that we have that analysis.  How'd the meeting with PG&E go?  You get back to Houston OK?
 
 Best,
 Jeff
 
  
     
 Jeff, thanks again for attending the discussions with DWR.
 
 Do you have any recon.... on exactly which plants DWR has the right to bring the fuel on. As Mark indicated, it was about 1/3 of their exposure, and most of that was in the south service area, but I am very interested in the actual facilities and whom used to bring fuel to them or run the units.'
 
 There is a zero sum game on fuel... but the landscape changes depending on who buys it and how they buy it! 
 
 Any thoughts.
