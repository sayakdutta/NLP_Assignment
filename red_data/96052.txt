 Woody has asked that we do whatever is needed to put good paper in place with 
 the following counterparties so that his deal flow in NE can be done a bit 
 more smoothly.
 New Brunswick Power
 Green Mountain Power
 Central Vermont PUblic Service Company
 Northeast Utilities (agent for CP&L, Western Mass, etc.)
 Bangor Hydroelectric Company
 
 As you know, I've already gotten some of the wheels rolling on these 
 counterparties, but the work isn't finished yet on any of them.  And Green 
 Mountain just filed a new tariff.  Is this something that I could ask Marcus 
 to work on with me?  (I understand from Genia that he's now in our group and 
 is looking for work.)  Thanks.
 
 Regards,
 Janice
