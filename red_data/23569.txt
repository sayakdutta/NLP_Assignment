 I would like to instruct the following firm in Bulgaria  Djingov Gouginski 
 Kyutchukov & Velichkov, 10 Tsar Osvoboditel Blvd, 1000 Sofia to review the 
 enforceability of a commercial representative agreement for Enron Metals & 
 Commodity Corp. Enron Europe Limited have recommended this firm. 
  
 If you are uncomfortable with this firm please advise and I will seek out 
 another, unless of course you have a preference for a particular firm in 
 Bulgaria.
  
 Many thanks.
  
 Kind regards.
  
 Marcus
