 
 Jay, 
 
 A couple of weeks ago I asked you to review the City of Las Cruces and let me know if we have an enfolio or if we have sent them a draft.  Could you let me know where we stand with that?  I need to respond to them by Monday, the 8th.
 
 thanks,
 
 Kim
 
 PS  Also, I know you sent Debra a request for an Enfolio for IID but I never received a copy.  Did you?
