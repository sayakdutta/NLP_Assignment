 
 I think you should include net commercial contribution as that is what Danny is responsible for.  Can you add to this schedule.

 Please look at attached schedule.  Tracy, please fill in TW. 
 
 Steve, I have a $0.1 rounding problem.  Where should it be fixed?  I filled this in from your 2/16/01 file.
 
 I will begin keeping this schedule without explanations.  This is designed very similar to how Tracy keeps her IBIT and NI for ETS as a whole.  Explanations and story line should be included on your individual margin pages just as we showed Danny last week.
