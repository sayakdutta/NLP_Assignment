 have stopped by! No worries, though, I'm sure we'll have many more. Thanks 
 for the info for Molly - I'll pass it along, for whatever it's worth. Also, I 
 noticed you hadn't deposited the check yet - if you'd like, I can bring you 
 cash at about 11:30 this morning. Just thought maybe that would be easier for 
 you. Let me know.

 Hi Kate,
  Here is the name of the organization I thought Molly might be interested in.

   Portland  OR  97204

 I have more information about them if she's interested.
 How was your party?
