 Received a call from Perez lawyer, Javier Casal, saying that they have been 
 occupying most of their time in another priority Project and this is why they 
 are delayed with their answer on the MSA proposal. He said that they have 
 scheduled an internal meeting for next Monday, Aug. 9 to tackle this MSA with 
 Enron Corp. and they will contact us asap with their comments.
 
 I told Perez that it was not worth while to delay it further than one more 
 month. Casal answered that he took resposability for taking care of this 
 matter.
 
 keep you posted.
