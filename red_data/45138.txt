 makes us look heavy handed to send a signed document, giving a tone like 
 "this is not negotiable!".

 Hi Tana,
 
 To answer your questions 
 
 1. The companys full name is NatSource LLC
 2. I'm not sure but it should be exactly the same as what we sent to True 
 Quote, Houston Street and Espeed.
 3. The project is for posting EOL prices on NatSources Electronic Trading 
 Platform.
 4. The companys address is 
 Nat Source LLC 
 140 Broadway
 30th Floor, New York
 NY 10005
 It should be sent to the attention of Jack Hogan (Tel 212-232-5335, 
 fax-212-232-5354) Their General Counsel is Andrew O Connor (tel 
 212-286-1234). Andy Zipper will sign the document before it is sent.
 5. Its not a rush we're just starting to talk to them.
 
 I hope this gives you all the information you need. Thanks a lot.

 In order to prepare a Confidentiality Agreement, I will need the following 
 information:
 
 1.  The company's full legal name
 2.  Whether we want a bilateral or Enron Protected Counterparty form
 3.  What is the nature of the protected information (what project or type of 
 transaction is it for)
 4.  The company's address, phone number and fax number
 5.  Any timing involved for getting this signed (is there a meeting Monday 
 morning at 9:00 am, so it's a rush, or just send it out, we're starting to 
 talk to them)
