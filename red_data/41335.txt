 
 I spoke with Frank about your proposed changes and he was okay with your first change, however,  the definition of "Investment Policy" does appear in Section 5(c)(i).  What documentation sets forth your investment objectives, restrictions, etc.?
 
 Also, do you have any comments to the forms of guaranty agreements attached to the ISDA?
 
 Finally, we are awaiting copies of Quark's documents, those of its Manager and those of any other relevant entities so that we can review them and verify that there are no issues that would require delivery of a legal opinion.
 
 Thank you for your assistance.

 Marie,
 
 Thank you very much for the drafts. I believe we are almost there.
 Please chack with Frank and see if the following changes are acceptable:
 
 1. Part 5(b)(g)Eligibility.  Remove the second rep. for eligible commercial
 entity.
 
 2. Part 5(p) Additional Definitions.  Quark does not have a prospectus.  In
 any
 case I don't think we need this definition.
 
 I think that may be it.

 Mr. Bicker:
 
 Pursuant to Frank Sayre's request, I am attaching a clean and blacklined
 copy of the draft Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement, together with
 the draft Paragraph 13 to the Credit Support Annex, which drafts
 incorporate the latest comments and revisions.
 
 Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions or comments.
 
 Thank you!
