 I think that day is fine from a childcare perspective.  I can be there.

 The African American caucus would like to have dinner with us in
 
 Sacramento
 
 on September 6 from 7:00 to 8:30. The total number of caucus attendees
 
 will
 
 be dictated by how many of us can make it.  They will do the
 
 coordination.
 
 Any takers?
