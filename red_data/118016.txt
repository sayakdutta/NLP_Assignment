 
 I suggest you work through Matthew Dawson in the London legal department.  
 They should be able to help you.

 Hi Mark
 
 I would be grateful if you could please let us know which paralegal has been 
 assigned to assist in the matter.   
 
 We have just signed an ISDA Master Agreement with Caltex Trading Pte Ltd and 
 the same has to be executed by an officer of Enron Capital & Trade Resources 
 International Corp.
 
 Many thanks
 Angie

 I have passed your request to Mark Taylor to assign to another paralegal.  I 
 no longer handle the day to day swap work, I am working on Online 
 predominately now.  By copy of this email, I will ask Mark to let you know 
 what paralegal he has assigned this to.

 Hi Tana -
 
 We are trying to put in place an ISDA Master Agreement between Enron 
 Australia Finance Pty Ltd and Enron Capital & Trade Resources International 
 Corp (Singapore Branch).    Enron Australia has already signed on the 
 document. Can we send it to you to help us get the necessary signatures for 
 ECTRIC (Singapore Branch)?
 
 I have prepared the following documents but not sure if they are most up to 
 date:
 
 1. Certificate of Assistant Secretary
 
 2. Certificate of Secretary
 
 3. Unanimous Consent of Directors (this is incomplete cos I am not sure of 
 the part starting from RESOLVED ..)
 
 
 Is there any other documents that I have missed out?  Would appreciate your 
 help and guidance whether I have done the above correctly.  If there is 
 anything incorrect, please guide me accordingly.
 
 
 
 
 
 Many thanks
 Angie
