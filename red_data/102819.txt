 
 Attached pursuant to TK Lohman's request is an electronic copy of 
 Transwestern's October 17, 2000 FERC filing proposing a transport options 
 program.
 
 This copy does not include the tariff sheets as they are not available in 
 electronic format.  If you would like to see the proposed tariff sheets, 
 please let me know and I will be happy to fax them to you.
 
 If you have questions or comments about transport options, please contact 
 either TK or me.
