 I think as long as someone from legal will accompany me I'd be fine with it.  My schedule is fairly open this week after 3:30.

 Hi Fletch:
 
 I am relatively new with Enron Government Affairs and am supporting EOL.  We have been compiling information on energy trading to create an educational piece for regulators and your book has been quite helpful.  Would you have some time to meet with us to discuss some of these issues?  Please let me know a convenient time.
 
 Thanks and regards,
 Maggy Huson
