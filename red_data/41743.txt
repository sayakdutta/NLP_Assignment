 I don't think this has been assigned.  Looks like Southern wants to use their own form (ugh).  Any thoughts on priority or who should get this one.  Sarah or Leslie? Thanks

 As we discussed last week, attached is netting agreement for Electric Power.
 In my opinion the agreement is standard in nature and as you should  agree,
 in my opinion of course.  Please review and comment if you would like to
 modify.  
 
 As you know,  I will  be question frequently regarding the status of this
 agreement,  therefore anything I can do to help complete this agreement in a
 timely manner will be appreciated.
