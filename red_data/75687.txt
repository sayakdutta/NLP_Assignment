 they have difficulty closing?  We can pay their consulting fee up front. 
 Maybe we can pay it into an escrow account.   
 
 What is our concern?  They don't have to use lawyers if they don't want to, 
 and Shutts doesn't have to work for them if they are uncomfortable.  
 Obviously, Shutts has the ability to quote an upfront retainer.  I'm sure 
 they've thought of that all ready.
 
 I guess I'm not clear on our level of involvement with their lawyers.
 
 I believe my availability is good for Wednesday.

 Kay,
 
 I spoke to Raul Salas of Shutts & Bowen re: amending the arrangment we have 
 for the Certosa Holdings property.  He called me back to say that his client 
 will be in Miami Wednesday but wanted us to pay the Shutts & Bowen invoice 
 before we meet.  I think Certosa Holdings is not paying its bills.  But they 
 did remove the last lien on the property.  We will need to develop a 
 structure where we pay something to Certosa Holdings so it can recoup some 
 costs but we will also need to cover future legal and consulting costs 
 incurred by Certosa Holdings. Can you help??  Would you be available for at 
 least a call Wednesday or Thursday?  
 
 I'll be back in Miami Tuesday but I can be reached over the weekend on my 
 cell 713 857 0367 or my pager 877 461 4413.  I'll also try to check my email 
 daily
