 I don't know of any such beginnings of an ISDA.  It may have been with the
 Fuel's Dept.  Sounds like your Doc person might do better with our
 Lawyer--Bill Ernstafht 212 468-6118.
 
 
     
 
 Yet another email.....
 Hi Mike!
 Our legal/documentations department tells me that we started putting
 together an ISDA with NYPA over a year ago, but never completed it.  What
 we need prior to any deals being executed is a legal opinion that contracts
 are enforcable and statutory authority (I suppose this is compliments of
 Orange County).  Can I have our documents person call you...or is someone
 else there more appropriate
