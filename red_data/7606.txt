 
 I still agree that this is not the time for promotion to VP.  Kristin 
 certainly did an outstanding job in her role within ENA during the first half 
 of the year.  I would like to see her develop a broader view across the 
 organization and be able to be more effective in working with others and 
 sharing her knowledge and experience before she is promoted to VP.  I guess 
 that the one caveat that I would put out, is to wait and see if there are 
 other names brought forth from other parts of the organization that would 
 make it seem that Kristin should be in that pack.  --Sally

 thanks
 
 as we discussed - my feeling is to not promote to VP this time - are you cool 
 with that still? - given that we have no other outstanding candidates for VP 
 in her 'peer group'
