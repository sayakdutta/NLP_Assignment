 Thanks for your quick response.  As for me, I've got about 3 weeks to go and 
 after this week, pretty much anything goes.  I feel great and am really 
 excited and anxious.  In the meantime, I'm using my pregnancy as an excuse to 
 get our counterparties to finalize our ISDA's and it appears to be working!  
 Thanks for asking.

 I'm okay with the language.  How are you doing?

 We are trying to finalize our ISDA with Deutsche Bank.  In the Guaranty where 
 we have the setoff and counterclaim language they want to add a proviso that 
 basically states that Enron Corp. would be entitled to get the benefit of the 
 rights, setoffs, counterclaims and other defenses that ENA is entitled to 
 only to the extent taht it would have had the benefit of those rights if it 
 were the direct counterparty.  I think that I am okay with this but wanted 
 your input.  Let me know what you think.  Thanks.
