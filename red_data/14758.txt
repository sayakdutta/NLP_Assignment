 
 Can they come in the afternoon on Feb 18 (President's Day)?  I have an appointment with the tax lady in the AM.
 
 Can you see about getting Alina a Dentist appointment on Mar 1 at 8 AM  (or at 1 PM) ?  Is it time for Chad to have an appointment again?  Chad has off school on Mar 1 & I plan to take a vacation day.  Alina has an appointment for more vaccinations with Dr Kline at 10 AM.  We may go to the zoo after that.
 
 
 
 
     
 
 Q,
 
 What days are you available for Sundeck to come out?
