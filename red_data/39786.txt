 
 I would love to do that but I have a commitment on Saturday night in 
 Houston.  Thanks for looking into it for me.  Next time.  See you next week.

 Mark;
 
 Unfortunately, no soccer games on Monday and Tuesday.  However, if you are 
 willing to anticipate your flight (Saturday night instead of Sunday night), 
 Corinthians is playing its oldest and strongest competitor Palmeiras on 
 Sunday at Morumbi Stadium at 4:00pm.  The most famous soccer games in Brazil 
 are:  Flamengo vs. Fluminense in Rio ("Fla-Flu") and Corinthians vs. 
 Palmeiras in S?o Paulo.  Please let me know if you want me to get VIP seats 
 for you and others.
 
 Rgds,
 
 Sami
