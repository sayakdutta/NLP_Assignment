 Should we get 4 bankruptcy postids?
  
     
 I am now getting 4 official post ids from EnPower for the bankruptcy books.  We used to get only 2 (East and West).  Should we be getting four (4)?  For the 4th of January we got the following Post IDS
 
 
 POST_ID
 15616
 15622
 15623
 15628
 
 Were those correct ?  If let us know when we should be getting a larger count on a daily basis.
