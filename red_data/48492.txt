 Much thanks!
 
 
     
 
 I've been advised that its complete but haven't confirmed. I'll let you know in a little bit.

 Lance,
 
 I just spoke to Mary Cook and she would like all four areas done by the end of today.  Is that doable?
 
 	 
 	 	 	 	 
 	Will do.
 
 		 
 		 		 		 		 
 		Lance,
 
 		Can you have your install people mark with a yellow sticky or something where the analog lines for the PCs are located.  Much thanks!

 					The suite of offices on 29 will be complete with a fax machine and an additional analog line for P.C. dial-up access by close of business today.  The only exception to your requirements is for an additional table in the empty room.  I believe that will be in by mid day tomorrow.
 
 					We will prepare 32 Thursday.
