 I am still here but I am unable to give out quotes at this time.  Please accept my apologies and I will be in touch once things are straightened out around here.

 Kim:
     If you're still there, I'm checking on prices for United Cogen's 38
 month strip at the PG&E citygate, running from June'03 through August '06.
 Hope things are getting better there.  Thanks a lot.
