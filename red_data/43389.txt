 Almost done with your drafts.  Took me a little longer to review and revise
 Adam's first drafts than I had thought (there's a lot going on here, as
 you'll see soon).
 
 I expect to send them out to you sometime tomorrow. Since Debbie is a client
 too, I think I'll just mail them to your home unless you prefer otherwise.
