 How are we handling ABN Amro?  I want to have executed.  Were you going to 
 revise the notice page and add the location on the trading floor in the other 
 agreement (?).  Please talk to Sam.  The docs are in my office.  I have 
 meetings all afternoon.  Thanks.  Sara

 Mike Fowler called and wanted to know where we were on the Subscriber 
 Agreement.
