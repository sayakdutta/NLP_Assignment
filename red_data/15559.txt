 Barbara and Bill,
 
 Hope your travels have (or will) return you safely.  I prepared the
 following based upon our discussion last Sunday involving our collective
 review of the contracts.  I provided these to the group today, with the
 understanding they were darft due to the fact that neither of you have had
 an opportunity to reivew.  The plan is that tomorrow, the Speaker will be
 attending a portion of our meeting, and we'll present to him our findings
 on the agreements.
 
 Thanks
 
 Gary
