 were there.  We need to authorize someone in the US to execute swaps on 
 behalf of ESA.  Brent Hendry (after speaking with Jana Morse) thought Martha 
 Stevens or Scott Mills would be good candidates (if not already authorized).  
 Please give me or Brent a call. We're trying to get this done next week since 
 TBS executed a swap in January, 2000 and we are still trying to confirm. 
 Also, let's have lunch.  Sara
