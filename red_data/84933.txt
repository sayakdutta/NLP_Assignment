 I haven't recieved any further mail for you from Shell.  I think you said 
 there should be more coming.
 
 
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
    
 How about meeting for happy hour at State Bar after work around 6, we can 
 play the rest by ear.......

 Hi - Would you like to have dinner next week?  Maybe Thursday?  It's Chris' 
 spring break and I told her I'd help her start packing since she moves out at 
 the end of the month.  She'll be leaving Thursday afternoon to go to work so 
 I won't be needing to help her Thursday night.  Just let me know if you are 
 interested.
 
 Lisa
