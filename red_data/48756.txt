 Vince,
 ?
 I can offer you 12.5% off of your order for 50 books (we originally spoke  to 
 Habiba about setting up a 50% discount?but Enron would have to order a  
 minimum of 200 books.??since the?change over, nothing has been  set up on 
 this).? 
 ?
 Let me know if I should go ahead with the invoice.
 ?
 Thanks,
 Julie
