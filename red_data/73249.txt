 
 Due to the size of this possible transaction, I thought I would keep you in 
 the loop on its status.
 
 We submitted a bid with caveats as to its non-binding nature, and suggested 
 an alternative structure.  In response, Navigant issued questions. John 
 Llodra has compiled answers, which appear to be fine to me.
 
  We  (Legal) have been instructed to standby, awaiting commercial guidance as 
 to whether we will be going forward.  I believe Klauberg has either cleared 
 conflicts or initiated the process, so if we go forward, he should be our man.
 
 I will let you know once a go/no go decision is reached.
