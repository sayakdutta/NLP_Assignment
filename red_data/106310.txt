 I want to send legal comments to SSB and Morgan Stanley today.  Since I do 
 not have the names of any lawyers, please verify that I should begin with:
 
 (1)  SSB:  Tania Meyer Wilson, VP Investments
 
 (2)  Morgan:  Joseph A. Marovich (his card was attached to the documents) 
 
 Have you received anything from Goldman Sachs?
