 
 Mark Taylor asked me to contact you about the referenced NDA.  He said you 
 were the lawyer for Dealbench.  I'm a paralegal that works with Mark, and we 
 got a call from a member of the Online Team, Dave Samuels, who said that "a 
 lawyer" was working on an NDA for Dealbench, and he wanted to confirm that 
 the agreement reflected Enron Net Works, not Dealbench, as the Enron 
 counterparty.  Is this something you are working on and familiar with?  If 
 so, can you provide me with a copy of what you are working on?  We appreciate 
 your help!
