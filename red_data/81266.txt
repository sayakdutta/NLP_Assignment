 I hope its going well!
 
 I just wanted to respond to your request to have the buy's/sell's outline for you in the summery of one month trades.  Could you please explain why you need this information to complete your pie chart?  It would be my  preference not to include this information as our trading positions could be piece together prior to us having time to close out of those positions.  The risk of outside parties knowing our positions is of grave concern and it would be my preference to avoid this if at all possible.
 
 Please give me a call to discuss.
 
 Regards,
 
 Jon
