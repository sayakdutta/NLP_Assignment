 [Vince,]
 Jeff,
 
 I cannot interview Howard on Tue (business trip) [OK- I will let London know 
 this].
 I think the organization is very interested in him [Thank you for your 
 help...I always consider working for you, primarily- not just Enron as a 
 company...my goal is to make you happy and do what you want; My mission was 
 to get Howard to you, I understand he will go in front of the directors in 
 London- what can I do to help you interview him? I understand that ?Melanie? 
 is doing this...and the Manager of Risk at RW is directing Howard. Do you 
 want me to set Howard up with you after the second round in Enron London?]
 
 I don't know what "illicts your attention" means [Sorry, mistype in the 
 car...was traveling to the snow with my girlfriend on a "mini-vacation" today 
 (I neglect her and took off to make her happy)...I constantly think of my 
 work (never peace of mind) and because I remain loyal to you...I recieved 
 this email information on Howard today(form Enron London) and felt it was 
 important enough for you to be aware of (the 2nd interview) and make sure you 
 were happy regardless of where I'm going or what I'm doing (you said last 
 time you were going to interview this guy by video conference and Rachel said 
 she was going to set it up with you)- I didn't know, otherwise. If I don't 
 know something then I can't report to you accurate information therefore, I 
 forward everything to you- so, it is transparent or maybe you knew something 
 different or something I overlooked. I usually send everything and anything 
 related to this guy (Howard) because I know you liked him and I can't afford 
 any mi!
 stakes- sorry to be a pest. Anything you want me to do please tell me- I'll 
 do it. Thanks, Vince. Jeff]
