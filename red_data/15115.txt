 Thanks Fran.  Let me know if it bogs down or anything.  I'd like to get it done.
 
 
 
  
     
 Sean, I am working with Nikolay in Enpower IT (Bill Crook's and Will Smith's group) on this project.  They advised the week after next week they shall give us something to test on.  I will update you on that when it happens.

 I think that if the Enpower guys can modify the Build Route Reports to have a check box that says Exclude DART deals, and have it default to the checked position.
 
 That should take care of it.
 
  (Both versions of build route, Will Smith will know what I am talking about).

 Torrey Moorer in EOL IT group has created the Mid-C DART product on EOL.  In the future when a trade is done on EOL, it will be bridged into Enpower Deal Entry. However, although the "DART flag" will be on in deal entry, I believe for now it's informational only, and it's not doing anything to alert the schedulers.  I would like to know the rationale for creating this DART product and how you would like the schedulers in Day Ahead group (Cara's group) and Real Time (Bill's group) to see in their applications.  If I can get this info from you, I'll work with Enpower IT to put all necessary DART processes in place.  
 
 Thanks,
