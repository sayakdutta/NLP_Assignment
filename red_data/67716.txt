 Ok, Phillip, here's the story I was given by Jim Little, you tell me if it 
 makes sense.  In January this liquidation was out of the intra-month book.  
 Sometime betwen January and August, the liquidation was changed to the  
 FTbook and we don't liquidate out of the FT book, so the expected offset 
 didn't happen.

 I am curious why N70012.Q is a variance in 0001 and N70012.R is not a 
 variance in 0008.  If you look in the two fred files, 0001 has the liq 
 flashed and not in the GL, and in 0008 the liquidation is in flash and the 
 GL.  The counterparties in both are the same.  Jim needs to revise 0001 
 file.  Shout with any questions.  Thanks.
