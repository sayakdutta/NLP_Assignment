 I'll stop by the gallery.  Hope to see you...

 Sorry to hear that you won't be joining us. I will be sure to let Ben know
 that you wanted to attend.  Please do me a favor - an obvious favor but one
 that I will feel remiss if I do not ask...Please do not send him something
 before tomorrow night as it is still a surprise. I only ask because you
 mentioned that you would try to send him something tomorrow.  His actual
 birthday is on the 22nd so he still has no idea.
 Thank you and perhaps we can all get together on your next trip to NY.
 Be well and have a happy holiday season.

 Hi Hillary, hope you are well.  Unfortunately, I won't be able to make it
 tomorrow.  I just couldn't work out the schedule, but it was extremely
 thoughtful of you to invite me.  I hope you have a great time.....(I'll
 send something to Ben in the gallery tomorrow)...
 
 Best,
 
 Jeff

 Jeff,
 It was a pleasure meeting you on Saturday evening.  I hope that you will be
 able to join us for Ben's 30th celebration.  I would love to send you an
 official invitation so if you wouldn't mind sending your address to me via
 this email I'd be happy to send you all of the details.
 Saturday, December 16th at 8:45pm at Gonzales y Gonzales, dinner and
 dancing.
 If you can make it let me know.
 Thanks,
 Hillary
