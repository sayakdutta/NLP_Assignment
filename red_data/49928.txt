 The time I have spent at Enron has been the most fulfilling of my 
 professional career.  I have enjoyed great success with Enron; made many 
 friends and feel I have helped contribute to the company being recognized as 
 a leader of innovation.  Having said that, it was with enormous sadness that 
 I must tell you I have tenured my resignation to Beth Perlman earlier today.
 I want to thank each of you for all that you have done for me and with me in 
 my employment here at Enron.  It's been a pleasure working with you and an 
 honor representing this company. 
 If you would like to reach me please feel free to call or e-mail:
