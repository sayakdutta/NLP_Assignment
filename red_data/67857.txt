 not effect the value.  Only the Pipeline and trading zone will effect the 
 value.
 Thanks again.

 I have a favor to ask.  Would you mind asking your team to email or phone me 
 when they make a location change on a deal in sitara.  We had a case 
 yesterday where a deal was originally entered at one location for the deal 
 and for the hedge.  The point was incorrect and a person in logistics 
 corrected it.  The problem occurs in that sitara looks to verify the 
 locations are the same on the deal and the hedge and if they are, it will 
 then value the deal in the trader's book at mid.  If the locations are 
 different, it will value the deal at the customer price.  This could 
 potentially have a large impact on the trader's P&L.  It does not seem 
 pertinent to have your guys changing swap locations in addition to changing 
 deal locations due to time constraints.  We will be more than happy to make 
 the changes, and we should also be able to catch these problems in the first 
 place when we calc our books.  I would greatly appreciate your groups help in 
 cutting some of these issues off at the pass.  If you have any questions or 
 concerns, please feel free to give me a shout.  Thanks.
