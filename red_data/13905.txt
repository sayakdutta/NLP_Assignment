 I think we can say that they'll get no less than $4500, but we want to confirm with Weil.
 Don't know about parking/bus.  I think it is regular course, but we may have to change that regular course.

 key questions that would be great to answer for current employees before Friday:
 
 -Vacation policy, we should be able to answer this one ourselves. do we really need Weil's input?
 -Severance, obviously part of the retention request to the courts, but can we say that they will get no less than $4500?
 -Parking subsidy/bus subsidy-i'm tracking this with Steve Kean
 -business expenses paid pre-petition, part of the clarification to courts. just so you know, George Wasaff is not processing any expenses pre-filing across the board.
 
 
 
 I would love to be able to answer vacation, i think we should draft the following:
 
 -Carry over is 1 week, with exceptions approved by manager (Michelle, David is concerned to put out a blanket 2 week carry over as there are only pockets of people working all hours to year end)
 -We will pro-rate starting Jan 1 2002.  So when people are termed, they will receive prorated vacation, not full as in past, plus any carry over.
 
 Why can't we get this one out?

 Here it is for posting.  I'll craft an email to send to employees with a link to the intranet:
