 
 Julie,
 
 A few issues.
 
 1. I would like to register 2 members of my group for both courses (in 
 Houston):
 
 a. Paulo Issler
 b. Alex Huang
 
 I shall attend the course on weather only.  
 
 2. I have started the process to issue a check for 5,000 AUD for Lacima.
 Shirley sent you an update on this. The 2nd installment comes from the budget 
 of our 
 office in Australia. I shall talk to Paul Quilkey today about it. Please, let 
 me know if there is any delay.
 
 3. The book  will be used as textbook for the class I shall be teaching at 
 Rice.
 Rice Univ bookshop is placing an order.
 
 4. I would like to order 50 copies for my group. What is the ebst
 way to place the order?  Can we pay in US dollars?

 Please find attached information?for our next two courses and  workshops:? 
 Energy Derivatives:? Pricing and Risk Management and
 Weather Derivatives, which will be conducted in Houston and in London in  Feb 
 / March 2001.? Instructors will be Dr Les Clewlow and Dr Chris  Strickland.
 ?
 Because the course requires intense interaction, the courses will  be?limited 
 to a maximum of 15 people, so early registration is  encouraged.
 ?
 If you require further information, or would like to register for either or  
 both?courses, please contact me via this email or our web site,?www.
