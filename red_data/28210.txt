 correct address.  Maybe this will work--I figured you'd want an opportunity 
 to rebut.  Frank responded (through Deb Cappielo--he didn't have the guts to 
 call himself) that he actually held the Gen. Couns. and Marketing VP jobs 
 simultaneously for 3 months so I'm still way short of matching his record.DF

 In case you haven't already marked your calendars, tomorrow will be my two 
 year anniversary with the company.   The good Lord willing (and with Stan's 
 and Mike's continued acquiescence) I may even surpass the tenure of my two 
 most recent and very illustrious predecessors.  Given your meteoric career 
 tracks, however, I'm not sure you guys would view that as a huge 
 accomplishment.  Hope all goes well with you both.  Adios from the big O.
