 That is good news.  Now we have the GISB to finish off.
 
 As for your question, I have been hiking, but not as much as I would like.
 Actually, I'm hoping to pick up a weekend of intense instruction in
 technical rock climbing near Estes Park in the near future.  The brother of
 a friend is a serious climber and instructor who gives private lessons to
 fund his ever-expanding collection of climbing toys.
