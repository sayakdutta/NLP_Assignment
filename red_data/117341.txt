 I definitely need to send Aspect a letter.  Per Fred Lagrasta, we would like 
 to "cancel" this call until it is necessary in the future.  We are not 
 revisiting the financials.

 Per our conversation I am attaching the Margin Call notification that was 
 sent to Aspect Resources.  As I mentioned, Wayne Williamson has received this 
 notice.   We do have someone looking further into Aspect's financials, but we 
 do feel that there might br a need to send a letter to Aspect regarding a 
 Margin Call cancellation.  Thanks in advance for your assistance.
