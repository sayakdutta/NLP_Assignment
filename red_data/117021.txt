 Attached are revised versions of the GTC's (both a clean version and a 
 version marked to show changes since last Friday's draft).  I will forward my 
 comments in respect of the long definition tomorrow - as I would like to make 
 my comments after speaking with Jay Hawthorn.  Please do not hesitate to 
 contact me should you have any questions or comments with regard to this 
 document.  Please note that I haven't yet heard anything from Dorn Hetzel - 
 in the event that I do, I will revise and try and turn the document tomorrow 
 afternoon.
