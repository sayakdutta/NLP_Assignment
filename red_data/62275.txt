 Hi John,
 Are you okay with combining the Retail line and Executive line for Canada?

 I am currently looking at reconciling Canada's P&L numbers for Q1 and Q2 to the ENA Earnings Estimate for Q1 & Q2 for 2001.  Could you let me know who is responsible for generating the total margin, direct & operating expenses and capital charge numbers for Canada in the ENA Earnings Estimate file?  In addition, can you please combine the Retail (Milnthorp) and Executive (Milnthorp) rows together on the Q1 and Q2 Earnings Estimate as the Retail division no longer exists in Canada?  
 
 Thank you in advance for your assistance.
