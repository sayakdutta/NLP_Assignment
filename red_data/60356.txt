 
 I have already registered several domaine names in the interest of getting up and running as soon as possible post sale of the business.  I have experience of delays as we have tried to retrieve domaine names where people have squatted intentionally in order to extract large sums of cash.  Should any of the buyers raise any issues - I do intend to use these for the purposes of our new business.		
 I have a lot of them - spurious and real.
