 idea to do it.  I'll write the prof an email and ask him to email us the 
 file.  My preference (in order to actually learn something--i'm sort of 
 thick) is to work on these jointly rather than have one person do it each 
 week, but i'm willing to discuss.  others have views on how we ought to write 
 'em up?
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 I, too, read the case and was prepared to write a memo except for the crucial
 fact that I have no idea what the prof. is looking for.  I haven't seen the
 suggested questions which I assume will point us in the right direction.

 I took a look at the case last night.  It is very short and appears to be
 somewhat straight forward.  We may want to work on this one as insurance.
 
 Has anyone received the files with the suggested questions and spreadsheets
 yet?
