 
 I have been out of the office at the Orange Bowl game and have just returned 
 within the last hour.  That probably would make next week better for me than 
 this week.  Give me a call and we will set something up.  My number is 
 x35926.  If you don't reach me, call my temp assistant (Camella - x39106) and 
 she will be able to set  up a meeting.  Thanks.

 Sally,
  We met in December to discuss my PRC and towards the end of our meeting, I 
 had asked if you might have some time to discuss recommended rotations.  
 Would you have any time this week to give me some recommendations?
 Thanks,
 Kim Bergen
