 Kevin -
 
 Esith and I will need to get your signature on an unwind transaction today.  Basically, we are unwinding two TX sites for Owens Corning.  They are currently retail index and wholesale index structures with fixed basis and we allow them to shop prices annually (amazing).   They have a better price from Reliant for two years only, but we have told them if they go with Reliant then we unwind the entire deal - our deal is ten years though 9/09.  It appears as though the customer (OC) will accept this.  The two sites are on our books currently at -$5MM - -$6MM - thus we would be glad to get it off our books.  we would keep roughly 50% of the value to cover "unwind costs, with the rest going to EES Origination.
 
 
 Edith - any other comments or clarifications?
