 
 Dear Gretchen:  
 
 Wow!  You are thinking ahead!  What is a Leap Pad?  Is it something computer 
 related? I have never heard of it.
 
 On our end, we have planned a trip to DC to visit Madison in August -- nice 
 and hot by then.  We just got word that we have tix to the Orioles game while 
 we are there, so that is good.  We got new furniture in the living room -- a 
 chocolate brown suede/leather sofa and chair/ottoman.  It amplified the need 
 for bright art in that room -- to the galleries and starving artists sales we 
 go!
 
 Stay cool -- Michelle

 Hi!? The heat has gotten to us!? We are  thinking Christmas.? We would like 
 to give C a Leap Pad if he doesn't have  one and you and T think it would be 
 appropriate.? The item is for ages 4  and up but we do not think C is too 
 young for it and hopefully it will get him  to read more.? Nothing exciting 
 happening here.? Just waiting, waiting  for furniture, materials, etc.? Takes 
 forever as you well know.?  What's happening your end?? G?
