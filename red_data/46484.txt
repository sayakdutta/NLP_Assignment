 
 How was your trip back?  I hear from Taffy you cut quite the figure in your 
 cowboy duds, right down to having the right style of Wrangler jeans.  The 
 grapevine says you also did some mighty fine two steppin.  The bright lights 
 of London must look dim after the shining lights of Houston.   Your visit 
 seemed all too short.  We probably won't see you for a few years, but I 
 really enjoyed our dinners and chats.
 
 Stay out of trouble and make us proud!
