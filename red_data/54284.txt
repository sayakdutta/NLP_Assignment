 Vince,
 
 After checking into this issue I have found that the type of information 
 requested is proprietary and not available for release.  I will try to 
 contact them and see if there is something else we can help them with but as 
 far as the data is concerned I don't believe we can help them with that 
 request.  I am sorry I couldn't be of more help.  Thank you.

 Shalesh,
 
 Please, look into it. Can we give them this information?
 I see a remote possibility of a gain for Enron: it's in our interest to 
 support
 the growth of this market and part of the process is development of the
 infrastructure for this market and maintaining public interest.

 Dear Sir:
 
  The Scientific computation group at the University of
  Waterloo, Ontario, Canada, has recently started to be very
  interested in the recent developments of the bandwidth
  market. We find that the specifics of the bandwidth market
  offer challenges from the modelling point
  of view.
 
  However, we have encountered difficulties when looking for
  data, and we were wondering if you could help us. Specifically
  we would like to know for a given city pair for the different
  existing type of lines ( e.g. OC3, OC12, OC48 .... )
 
 1. What has been the spot lease prices (e.g. $/line-type/mile) for
         the past 12 months?
 
 2. What is the price of the dark fiber for a given type of line?
 
 3. What is the maintenance cost $/month ?
            (for the same lines, e.g. OC3, OC12, OC48, ...)
 
 4. What is the upgrading cost for the different lines?
            (e.g. how much does it cost to upgrade)
                 OC3  --> OC12
                 OC3  --> OC48
                 OC12 --> OC48
 
 5. How long does it take to upgrade a line from a certain
         capacity to another (e.g. 1 month, 2 month, ...) ?
 
 
 
  We realize that some of these questions may ask for confidential
 data, in that case we would really appreciate if an order of magnitude
 was provided. I look forward to hearing from you.
 
 
 Sincerely,
 
 
 Yann d'Halluin
