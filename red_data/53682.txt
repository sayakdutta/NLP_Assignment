 
 Bjorn,
 
 I don't think the scope of the project is really that big. When we looked
 into it, it seemed like a relatively minor issue. 
 
 To me, it's  really a matter of routine maintenance that should not be
 an equivalent of a Desert Storm operation.
 
 Zimin and I will call Slava on Tuesday and determine what has to be done.

 We had discussed this briefly before I went on vacation. What did you want to do with this?

 Hi Bjorn,
 
 some time ago we, you, Stinson and I, had a meeting in Houston regarding having the same versions for Houston and London.
 
 We agreed that you would talk to Ted Murphy to get his support for this project. I know that Ted did not come to Houston at the time he planned and therefore you were not able to talk to him (you were on holidays when he came to Houston).
 
 This project is really big (several man month work) and we cannot do this without Ted's support. You know that requests from RAC are always taken very seriously.
 
 Please, could you talk to Ted to get his support.
 
 many thanks,
 
 Slava
