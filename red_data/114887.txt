 correction report that this was due to a late report from EES. Thanks for 
 catching this.

 Kate, below is the EES spreadsheet that has the shows the powerex trade shown 
 on 12/4/00.  Please verify and we can backdate the trade and reconfirm the 
 document, or we can initial Powerex change and send back to them to show that 
 we are in agreement.  Thanks Stephanie
