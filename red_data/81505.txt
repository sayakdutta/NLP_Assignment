 
 Hey Johnelle,
 
 It's great to here from you again.  Yeah, I'm over at Enron now.  I manage 
 the group responsible for all of the natural gas financial trading risk 
 management.  I've been here for a little over a year now.  It's a great job 
 and company, but the hours are unbelievable!!!  The family's good.  How are 
 Janna, Gina, (sp) and your mom.  I'm afraid to ask --- how old is Janna now?  
 When you tell me, I'm going to feel really old!!  Tell everyone I said, 
 'Hi'.  The NYMEX was only open for half the day, so I'm taking advantage.  
 Call me when you get a minute!!

 Hey Errol,
 Over the holidays I heard that you were working at Enron and I thought I'd
 say hi.  How are things going for you?  How's your family doing?  I am
 good...just working at Sprint in Finance and going to school for my MBA.
 Well, holler back when you get a moment.
