 Just for grins.  Joe's home number on Sunday is 281-363-9913 - just in case 
 you two get disconnected.  His driver will pickup at Joe's home at 2:30 and 
 the driver's car phone number is 713-598-4052 or Joe's portable is 
 713-725-5979.
 
 Thanks

 Mr. Sutton,
 
 I'm emailing you on Greg Whalley's behalf.  Is it possible for Greg to join 
 you on the company plane on Sunday over to London for the Open House?    I 
 understand you have different plans on the return.   I can book him 
 commercial on the return.  No worries, if the answer is no, I'm holding 
 commercial flights both ways.
 
    Sunday, February 27


 
 Please advise.
