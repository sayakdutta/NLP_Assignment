 
 i live inside the loop here and usually don't leave unless i have to golf.  outside of the loop is pretty ugly.  which part of houston did you grow up in?  
 
  
     
 no i do not work for strip clubs!!!
 our 'in house' production department makes comercials
 for advertising companies; i.e. clubs, bars....and i
 did the voice work for them!  h-town IS the armpit of
 america.  i know, i've lived there all my life.  you
 cannot say it isn't dirty. especially after you see a
 beautiful clean place like austin. but i'm glad to know
 that there are people who still love houston too.
 
 what's my stripper name?!! nice.
