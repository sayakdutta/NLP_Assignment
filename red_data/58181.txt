 
 Neither Ken nor Jeff are available.  It would probably be better for one of 
 you to speak anyway.  Any interest?

 Steve,
 
 Here's the invitation I mentioned.? Thanks for following up on this and my 
 own personal invitation to get somebody to come to class.

 Dear Pankaj, 
 
 I enjoyed meeting you last week in BA.? Steve Reifenberg and I are both 
 grateful for your willingness to speak to Ken Lay at Enron on our behalf.?? I 
 have attached a copy of the letter we sent to him, as well as the preliminary 
 program for the October 20 DRCLAS Corporate Partners Program.? When we called 
 to follow up, we were told that it was unlikely that Ken Lay would be able to 
 participate, so we extended the invitation to Jeff Skilling as well.? We 
 would be delighted to have either one speak on the case of Enron at the 
 event. 
 
 Thanks again, and please let me know if there is someone in Lay's office with 
 whom I should follow up after you speak with him. 
 
 Best, 
 Ellen
