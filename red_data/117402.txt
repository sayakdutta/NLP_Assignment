 meeting any way - my first day back after vacation and everybody trying to 
 get lots done so we can get away to the Woodlands.  Be sure to let Taffy know 
 so she can put it on the calendar.

 Mark, I would like to attend an ENA orientation put on by the Development 
 Center on the morning of Oct. 4 (that's the Wednesday before the Woodlands 
 conference -- it doesn't conflict with the conference, but it would conflict 
 with our bi-weekly swaps group meeting that week).
 
 The orientation is simply an introduction to the various ENA departments 
 (trading, origination, structured finance, etc.) and how they interact.  It 
 sounds very basic but I think it would be very helpful to me -- especially in 
 the Chinese wall context.  
 
 I don't know whether there will be a charge to the department for this, but I 
 can find out if you want.  Please let me know your thoughts -- thanks, Bob
