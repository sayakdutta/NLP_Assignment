 
 Glen, at page 1020 of the transcript of yesterday's proceedings, the judge 
 asked you and Norm Pedersen to work with various other parties to develop an 
 exhibit reflecting capacity at the California border.  The judge mentioned 
 she wanted to discuss the exhibit this morning, so I am surprised that you 
 did not attempt to contact me to get Transwestern's input or at least to let 
 us review the exhibit.  I would like to review the exhibit as soon as 
 possible.  I am out of town but you can either e-mail it to me or fax it to 
 941-466-2198 (before 3 pm PDT).  Also, I should be reachable on my mobile 
 phone (713-494-5002) or by voice mail at my office (713-853-0596).
