 Mark,
 
 I will be UNABLE to attend being as I will be on Vacation.
 
 Hope you all have a fun time.

 I'd like to take the entire group out to lunch next Wednesday.  We have a reservation at Ninfa's on Navigation for 11:45.  Since they won't seat us unless everyone is there and we lose the table if we aren't there on time, I'd like to ask everyone to be ready to leave the building by 11:15.  We will arrange for cars on Wednesday morning.  Please let me know if you are NOT going to attend.  If I don't hear from you I will assume you are coming.
 
 Mark
