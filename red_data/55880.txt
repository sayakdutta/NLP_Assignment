 vince thanks for helping out.....we really need more dedicated assistance.  
 zak is probably more pure research and his son phil would possibly be on the 
 desk.....let's discuss after you have met them..

 I work with Melanie Doyle in London HR.  I have two candidates who I'm trying 
 to arrange (for Bryan Seyfried) to come in and see Vince Kaminski however I'm 
 finding it difficult to co-ordinate from this end.  Would it be possible for 
 you to forward these CV's on to Vince's assistant as I'm not sure who the 
 correct person is.
 
 Thanks for your help and if you need more details my number is 44 20 7783 
 6945.
 
 Regards
 Louise
