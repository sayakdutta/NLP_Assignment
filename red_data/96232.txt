 Elizabeth and David, have you had a chance to get back with Bonnie's
 assistant who is trying to schedule a meeting this week to work on your
 affidavits in response to Calpine's motion for summary judgment? We are
 trying to meet this Thursday 4/12. Will you either call Lee Carrier at
 853-6612 or respond to me by e-mail regarding your availability? As our
 response is due on 4/20, I would appreciate your earliest response. Thanks
 very much. Laura Gibson
