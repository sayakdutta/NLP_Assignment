 I've sent John an email (didn't have his number).  If you have it I will 
 follow up  with a phone call.
 
 I was out yesterday (jury duty called) and Janet was out-of-pocket this 
 afternoon.  I'll try to track her down tomorrow.
 
 I will forward the finance agreement to a finance lawyer and tax, and will 
 send you a copy so you'll know who is in the loop.

 Kay - just to be my usual pain-in-the-neck self, can you let me know about 
 the following:
 
 1-Status of the CA. Did you have a chance to speak with John Nassos?
 2-Management appointment.  If Janet signed it, can I get a copy to give to 
 Peoples?
 3-Intercompany loan document.  I am expecting our balance to increase again 
 this month (the 25th to be specific) and I would like to get something put in 
 place ASAP to earn a higher return.  If you have a name of a finance 
 attorney, I can try to explain what we are trying to accomplish and perhaps 
 there is a quicker way to get it done.   I know you were also looking at this 
 from a tax perspective.
 
 As always - thanks.
 
 Gregg
