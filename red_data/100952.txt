 
  Parties represented at an informal meeting after the February 7, 2000 
 prehearing conference discussed circulating redlined versions of the CAC 
 settlement proposal as a point of departure for further settlement 
 conferences.  Transwestern Pipeline Company submits the following comments in 
 lieu of a redlined document.
 
  Transwestern fully supports the CAC's proposal of a path-defined receipt 
 point structure that would define primary and secondary rights at receipt 
 points on the SoCalGas system. Not only does the proposal satisfy the 
 Commission's requirement that Hector Road be established as a formal receipt 
 point, it is also consistent with open and non-discriminatory access and use 
 of the SoCalGas system, and will help provide a reasonable degree of 
 certainty so that all market participants can more effectively plan gas 
 transportation.  CAC's proposed receipt point principles ensure that no 
 upstream transportation provider will unduly be denied access to SoCal's 
 system.
 
  Transwestern believes that the parties may still need to address certain 
 details regarding implementation of the receipt point proposal that have not 
 been fully described in the CAC document.  To this end, Transwestern proposes 
 that implementation of the receipt point proposal be included on the agenda 
 for the upcoming all-party settlement discussions.  Transwestern looks 
 forward to a constructive discussion of the proposal and is confident that 
 the parties will be able to agree on a plan for implementation.
