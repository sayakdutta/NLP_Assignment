 Hi Tana,
 
 This email is in response to my earlier voice mail regarding two NDAs to be 
 sent out today.  Here's what I think may be the pertinent information:
 
 Continental Airlines - Cargo
 1600 Smith Street
 Houston, TX 77002
 United States 
 Attn:  Mr. Ed O'Meara
 
 
 Eagle Global Logistics
 15350 Vickery Dr
 Houston, TX 77032
 Attn:  Mr. Stephen J. Carattini
 
 Content might say something about not mentioning any details about talking to 
 Enron about air cargo commoditization with any other company or to the press, 
 etc. until we give them express written permission.  
 
 I'm sure I forgot something relevant.  Just give me a call at 5-9323.
