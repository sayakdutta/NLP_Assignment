 Alan,
 
 Attached is the memo I promised.  It's sort of rough, but accurate.  Please feel free to utilize any or all of it.  It would be interesting to get Steve Walton's feedback as well.  Also, this doesn't really address my concerns with respect to curtailing firm exports under muni-transmission (at least not completely).   If you have any questions, let me know.
