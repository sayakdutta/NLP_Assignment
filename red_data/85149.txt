 party ownership of compression in interstate pipes.
 
 I will continue to research and see what might work.

 Here are two FERC cases for your ECS files.  The certificates for Cotton 
 Valley Compression are on tomorrow's FERC agenda.  The forthcoming orders may 
 be relevant to future ECS projects.  With respect to Transwestern, the 
 attached orders make it clear that the FERC knows how to order what it views 
 as a jurisdictional entity to show cause regarding its status and, ultimately 
 to file for a certificate.  This is consistent with our view  of the 
 Transwestern order. - Randy
