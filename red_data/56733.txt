 Hi Vince
 
 It is my great pleasure to invite you to speak at POWER 2000 which will be
 in Houston on 9 & 10 May 2000.
 
 Would you be interested in chairing one of the streams on day 2 of the
 conference? Or making a full presentation on one of the days? Please let me
 know which talks interest you. Obviously, some of the talks are no longer
 available but I would like to give you a choice as much as possible. Please
 could you get back to me asap on 212 925 1864 Ext 151 or by return email.
 
 I very much hope you can make the dates as I'm very keen to have you
 participate at POWER. Not to flatter you unnecessarily, but I know that a
 lot of people come to our conferences to hear what you have to say.
 
 Best regards
 
 Emma
