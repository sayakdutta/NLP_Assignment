 would need to talk to them about their authorizing statutes, legislative 
 authority and possible legal opinions before they can trade financial.  So if 
 they want to trade financial, get me a name and phone number, probably of one 
 of their lawyers and we'll have to talk to them.

 Great -- thanks.  If they want to do financial, would that be possible?
 
 
     
 Just an heads up, they are open to trade physical power, which I expect is 
 what they want to trade, but not financial.

 Tana,
 Thanks for the info -- the customer will be excited to have permanent access.

 Legal has signed off on the counterparty, so I expect it is being held up 
 with the online team for some reason.

 Claudia --   I see that this app is still in Legal (since 7/14).  Could you 
 give me an ETA on it?
 
 Thanks,
