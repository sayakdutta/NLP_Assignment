 Stacy -
 
 I will have to look at the ICE agreement and see if we can add affiliates to 
 the agreement.  Since the agreement was negotiated, if they cannot add us to 
 the current agreement, then they should be able to submit a similar version 
 for enovate to use.

 Mark, 
 
 The traders at enovate in the Chicago office would like to be able to use the 
 ICE system.  I understand that you are the person who should review these 
 agreements.  If you are not the right person, please let me know.  I am 
 sending a second e-mail that goes with this one.  Feel free to call me for 
 any additional information that you might need.
