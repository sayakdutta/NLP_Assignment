 DELETE IF NOT A BART SHUTTLE RIDER.
 
 A BART shuttle rider recently suggested that the shuttle leave 5 minutes
 earlier (9:35 pm rather than 9:40 pm) to accommodate the BART schedule.
 Apparently, the extra five minutes gets students to the station just
 shortly after BART leaves, causing students to wait until the next train
 20 minutes later.
 
 If you a BART shuttle rider, please provide me some feedback.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Diane
