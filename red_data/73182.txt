 Based on the fact that we're almost done with the project, I don't have any 
 comments to the S&S breakout contract for our units at Austin.  If you want 
 to remove the combined cycle language, I can live with that.  What I hope we 
 can keep are the Austin site specific basis conditions and performance 
 guarantees (which are currently listed in the contract you sent to me).  Let 
 me know if they resist.
 
 Thanks,
 Eric
