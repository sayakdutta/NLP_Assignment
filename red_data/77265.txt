 
 Hi Karen,
 
 Our accounting contact is leaving tomorrow at 100, so it would be helpful to 
 get this information as soon as possible.  It would also help if you could 
 send a redline against the version I had sent you, as this was the last draft 
 reviewed by Accounting.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay

 Karen,
 
 Please send me the revised version with the language you believe reflects 
 Rusty's suggestion. Otherwise, I will have to go to Accounting twice.
 
 Please email me with the specific performance language you want to add to 
 meet their request.
 
 Thank you,
 
 Kay
