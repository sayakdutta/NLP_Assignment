 hey greg, 
 
 happy new year.  i can't remember when you were taking your trip to france, but i hope things are going well.  i'm back in town now after a long and peaceful break - mainly just waiting to see what happens to the enron trading operations.  
 
 where did you buy the hardware when you built your servers?  i'm thinking of building a database server and am not sure if its best to mail order or buy in person somewhere in town.  
 
 hope you're well and talk to you soon,
 cooper
