 
 I've changed the counterparty name to The City of Oakland - and the contact 
 is Wing Lau. His number is (510) 627-1457. According to Stewart Rosman, the 
 middle marketer who did this deal, City of Oakland is the same entity as Port 
 of Oakland; however, City is the counterparty name in the system which is 
 linked with the correct contact info. I tried to look up the contract in 
 Livelink, but I keep getting an error message. Is there any way you can check 
 on this contract to make sure we're entering these deals with the correct 
 counterparty name?
 
 Thanks,
 Kate
