 
 I appreciate the email.  I figured something must be wrong for you to miss 
 the big day, but I was afraid to call.  The
 important thing, obviously, is that you get better.  We'll just have to 
 figure out a way to meet up with you in the near
 future.  Tell everyone I said hi and keep me informed of your operation and 
 recovery.  We'll all miss you very much.
 
 Hugs and Kisses,
 
 Kevin.
 
 P.S.  Tell Tom and John we said hi.
