 Thanks for the note. Yeah things look pretty lousy here at the big E. From first to worst in 4 easy weeks. The untold story is how much money the gas and power trading folks have made that some weenies in three piece in suits in Corp pissed away. Looks like we are going to be bought by Dynegy. Hang in there with ONE. I am agitating for a Christmas visit to Mich by us, so hope to see you then.
 
 Keep on it,
 Andy
