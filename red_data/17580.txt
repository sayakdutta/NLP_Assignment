 On 2/14, the Southern California Generator Coalition filed a petmod asking 
 that the Commission amend winter balancing rules to allow customers to bring 
 more gas into the system than the 10% imbalance rules permit and that 
 customers be allowed to use the previous month's accumulated positive 
 imbalance in lieu of flowing supplies.
  
 The generator members of WPTF with facilities in southern California may be 
 interested in knowing that TURN's 3/15 comments recommend instead that the 
 Commission should rebundle the costs of storage for electric generators in 
 their transportation rates and requires SoCalGas to store gas on behalf of 
 those customers.
  
 Let me know if you want to see the TURN comments.
