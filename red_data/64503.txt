 things have been good.  just been working a lot and living it up a little.  
 that is great that you started teaching 4th grade.  i watched florida play 
 last week.  they got lucky.  we will have to make a bet on the lsu-flor 
 game.  i will take the points of course.  i will let you think of the bet 
 since you are into that stuff.  i went out with jen & max in denver.  i guess 
 they are back together.  what is a good smaller town in florida to live in.
