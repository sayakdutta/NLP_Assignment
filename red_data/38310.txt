 
 Hello Mojo.  Things have been interesting.  Thanks for thinking of the desk.  We are playing lots of liar's poker and listening to music again.  How are the muffins?

 Hey there,
 I just wanted to say hello and that I am thinking about everyone right now 
 with all that is going on with ENE.  This morning at the bakery I heard the 
 radio announcer talking about the possible Dynegy acquisition and I felt 
 sick the rest of the morning. I hope you all get through this in good shape 
 and that things are going well for you.
 Take care,
 Mo
