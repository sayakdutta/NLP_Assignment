 
 Per my discussion with Mark Taylor and our conversation today, attached is 
 the form of Termination Agreement that should be used when terminating 
 EnronOnline mistake or "oops" trades.  The trades should continue to be 
 initially run past the Legal Department to determine whether there are any 
 unusual circumstances surrounding the trades, but absent unusual 
 circumstances, Legal will then pass the trades on to the Confirmation Desk 
 for preparation of the Termination Letter and further handling.  These same 
 procedure should apply to physical as well as financial transactions.
 
 Since this is a contract, the agreement will require the initials of a lawyer 
 and signature of a VP or above for the relevant company.  The Termination 
 Letter should be brought to the appropriate Legal Group for signature.
 
 The current policy with respect to mistake trades is that the trade should be 
 terminated.  Reverse trades should not be entered into.
 
 If you have any questions, please call.
