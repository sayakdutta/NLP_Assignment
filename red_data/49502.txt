 It's OK (even if the answer is ex post).

 Dear Molly,
 
 I asked about change of the departure city.  They said I should send my ticket
 back to get a new ticket. Since Aquila provides the ticket, it's hard for me
 to change the departing place. If possible, can I ask you to arrange the one
 way flight from Houston to Seattle on the evening of 25th?  I'm sorry for
 this.
 
 Thank you very much.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Jaesoo Lew
