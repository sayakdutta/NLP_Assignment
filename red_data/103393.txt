 Due to the timing differences I had a crack at including these changes.   
 
 Attached is an amended confirmation. The only change I was not sure about was 
 tightening up the temperature definition. Do you mean moving to greater 
 precision in rounding? No problem but we are following the UK approach. 
 
 I would be most interested in any comments Paul would have. By way of 
 background I consulted the London office on their rounding conventions for 
 Celsuis.

 Dear David,
 
 Thanks to you for your prompt attention and to Jerven for finding Christian's 
 corrected document.
 
 Nick has commenced the process to put a global confirm which can be used 
 woeldwide by Enron for weather derivatives, 
 He has contacted Paul Simons , ex Clifford Chance , ISDA board member, and 
 SFC compliance officer to kick off.
 
 In the meantime, we will use the document below { CDD 13-04-00.doc }
 but changes will still be further required - sorry :o(  
 
 A.
 Payment Date(s)
 
 want to say that final payment from any adjustment is no later than 20 biz 
 days after end of 95 days.
 Avoids continual payments if temp is revised frequently in the 95 days.
 
 
 B.
 in Floating amount for 
 time, and tighter defn of temperature
 and base temp is 18
 
 C.
 Data Sources
 I want to make the Final payment dependent not on website ( because website 
 is not updated when a correction occurs)
 but rather the final
 Data Source is  "daily temp and climate archive" of the National
 climate centre ( NCC) of BoM
 
 Do you want me to type up changes for you to peruse or shall i chase up 
 directly with Sara ?
 Who OKs the wording of the confirm. ?
 
 
 Thx, Raymond

 Paul,
 as per my voicemail - here is a draft confirm for weather - on the deems ISDA 
 basis preparred by the guys downunder. Would like you professional input to 
 help them with an interimsolution on this contract.
 
 Further down the line (and this should also be encompassed in the web stuff) 
 we need to have alegal group that works toward producing a master contract 
 confirm that can be used for all Weather deriv structures and used in a 
 global marketplace.  Just a quick job for a supremo like you!!! 
 
 I'll talk to you on Monday when I get back into London about the politics!!!
 
 have a great weekend
 Nick

 Raymond attached is the CDD confirmation form. I have gone through the 
 comments on the draft Jerven gave me. The only change I made is the inclusion 
 of a weather station number in addition to a name. There was a question mark 
 next to the website reference and a comment that there is no quality control 
 for public access. Is the website reference OK?
 
 Sara this confirmation follows the ENA model. The changes  only relate to the 
 differing measurement references. We also included a  paragraph 5 to further 
 reduce the possibility of the trade being characterised as insurance. If ENA 
 is the counterparty then it should be enough to reference the relevant ISDA 
 Master Agreement and change the references to EAF to ENA.
