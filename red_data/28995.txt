 maintenance, but I never miss the opportunity to suck up to a potential 
 customer, so hope you think my response is appropriate.  Thanks.

 I'll bring this up with Mr. Fawcett today and you will hear back from either 
 him or I or both shortly!  Glad to be of help.  DF
 
 
 

   
  
 
 
 Drew;
 Thanks for sending me off to read the order in CP99-522, etc.? I've  gotten a 
 good feel for the relevant TW issues. 
 Based on our preliminary information, TW looks attractive as the supply  
 source for the Wikieup project.? 
 ?
 FYI: I've discussed the project a couple of times with Jeff Fawcett, and he  
 promised a first cut estimate? of facilities costs on this (as well as  
 another) project, and suggested that it would be done by early March. 
 Currently,  however, he seems to be among the missing (not returning phone 
 calls,  etc.)? Maybe you could call over there and help me get his 
 attention??  I'd sure like to make some progress on this deal.
 ?
 Thanks for your help.
 Regards,
 GB
