 Dear Sir and Madam.
 
 I did not know whom to contact at Enron, so chose to contact you.  I am a 
 Ph.D candidate at the University of Rhode Island.  My speciality is English 
 and Business Communication.
 
 I am contacting you because I a person I know has applied and given a 
 high-end position within your company.  Please check his credentials.  He is 
 presenting himself as a Brown University Graduate with an MBA from another 
 college.
 
 Please be advised, I did a reference check with Brown, and he is not a Brown 
 graduate.  His name is Steven R. Hill.  
 
 I feel obliged to divulge this information to you because of the law that 
 holds me responsible for knowing that someone might be purposely 
 misrepresenting themselves.
 
 Mary K. Cardinale
