 Mary,
 
 As Brent Price is out of the country until July & I am travelling out of the 
 country more frequently, I would like to temporarily designate Susan Harrison 
 as a signer.  Susan is the Director of our off-system Settlements & Volume 
 Management groups.  This temporary designation will ensure that we maintain 
 appropriate signing coverage while Brent & I are unavailable.
 
 Thanks,
 Sally
