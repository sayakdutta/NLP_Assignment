 
 Hi Jeff and Valerie -
 
 Sorry I hadn't responded sooner.  I was trying to get Mr. Lay out of town.  
 Actually July 12 may work for him.  He is out of the office until June 12, 
 but I'll try to ask him on his messages, so you'll have an answer before then.

 Dear Ken,
 
 Although I didn't have your response in hand, based on the responses I have
 received, it seems that the best time for our next meeting is 3:00 - 5:30
 p.m. on July 12 in New York City.
 
 I do hope you will be able to make it.  Please let me know.
 
 In any event, I'll be in touch with you soon to follow up on the first
 meeting.
 
 Best regards,
 Jeff
