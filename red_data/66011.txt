 nothing. we did go get a pizza and then i passed out.  apparently i was more drunk then i thought. so funny story about me at the driving range yesterday...  i launched the 7 iron about 20-30 yds out onto the green. do you still think you might invite me to play a round with you some time?
 
  
     
 i will.  so what did you guys do to stay up until 7am on sunday night?
 
  
     
 Matt,
 
  i told susan that mitch and chad stayed over but didnt mention anything about her room or chad throwing up.  so remember that in your conversations with her.
