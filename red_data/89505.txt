 Yes! and when you come visit I'll take my ring off my finger and stick it in your face and ask if you've seen my beautiful ring yet.  Then I'll sit next to my fellow and hold his hand in order to try to force you to get used to the idea that I am so in love and that this is all so right, even though  I  and especially my fellow look extremely constipated.   I will not be attending the wedding.

 Dear Friends! 
 
 I hope you all had a wonderful Christmas holiday...it went by fast and 
 it's always a crazy time.  The kids had a blast with all of their new 
 gifts and gadgets that required frequent battery installation so the 
 house has been busy...and noisy.  (what kind of relative would buy the 
 noisiest toys in the store?!) 
 
 The best part of our holiday is that I became engaged on Christmas Eve. 
 It was a wonderfully planned proposal and I received a beautiful 
 engagement ring. The fellows' name is Brad Bailor and he is a wonderful 
 man .  We are very happy and plan a wedding sometime in July. 
 
 I just couldn't wait to share our news! 
 
 I hope all is well with all of you and Happy New Year! 
 
 Love, Lisa
