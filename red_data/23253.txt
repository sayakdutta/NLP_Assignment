 
 Steph, I have tried unsuccessfully to send an e-mail to Mark Dodson telling him that I have talked to Marcus Wood.  Would you attempt to forward this message to him?  Thank you.

 I am about to apply for the acquisition of PGE to the OPUC here in
 Oregon--Stoel Rives is our usual law firm and Marcus Wood has done some work
 for Enron so we would need to clear waivers with you--503 294-9434 is his
 phone number but he will be trying to reach you regarding this important
 matter--thank you for trying to reach me so promptly MARK
