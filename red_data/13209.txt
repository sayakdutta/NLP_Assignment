 Hi Michelle, we've finished our due diligence on John Guerriero from Duke.  I 
 didn't speak to his references but Paul DeVries did and he and Rob Milnthorp 
 are both satisfied that there were no earlier occurrences of the legal 
 situation that is unfolding now (or other signs of incompetence or lack of 
 judgement).  John is being courted by several companies right now and they 
 want to get an offer to him today.  Just wanted to let you know where we were 
 on this one....
