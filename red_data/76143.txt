 Kay Mann has requested that we run blacklines of the Enron South America
 Agreement and Exhibits showing changes from the original GE/West LB
 documents and to send them to her house.  Could you please run: (1) a
 blackline showing changes from the original GE/West LB agreement
 (Hou:554888.1) to the current version (Was:83164.6) and (2) a blackline
 of the original exhibits (Hou:554886.1) to the current exhibits
 (Hou:554886.6)?  Please have the blacklines delivered
 to Kay's house at 29 Inverness Parkway, Houston, 77055.  
 
 Thanks for your help Lori.  If you have any questions, give me a shout.
