 Hi Mike,
 
 The data that you sent, it has may, june and july 2001 load data. But, if you are interested in winter load forecast, we need to have some winter data. I was wondering if I could use some of the old data we received before.
 Please let me know.
 
 Thanks

 How is the project coming along?  No rush, just wanted to check in.
 
 Thanks,

 Mike,
 
 Attached are Palo Alto's historical loads, which have been verified with Palo Alto.  If you would like to see a different format, let me know.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kim
