 I hope this helps.
 
  
     
 Kevin -
 
 If I could see some off-peak markets I would be buying.  Unfortunately, I know info like this will just be used against me and the positions I am fighting.  Looks like we should be on the bid for some of these coal terminals from the producers.

 I have spent more time down that black hole called coal and have gotten even
 more bullish than I was when we spoke last. I wanted to give you some
 initial reactions, and hope that you will call to discuss your reaactions to
 my reactions (if that make sense to you).
 
 In looking at the MSHA data under a finer and finer slice, I was somewhat
 surprised to see the purging of employees in NAPP and CAPP. I have also been
 making the rounds in the major NAPP and CAPP basins to gauge the level of
 new activity, but it is surprising how sluggish the rebound is and will be.
 One could write that off to new problems with permitting (intermittent
 streams has become a real problem I am told) and/or to hiring problems while
 fighting off the coal unions some more. The other theory is that this
 oligopology that has gotten its sea legs! I am leaning towards a theory that
 the latter will use the former for cover. Given how bad EIA is, that cover
 could last a while. This market is ripe for a squeezing IF gas tightens a
 bit and net exports is somewhat inelastic at these levels!
 
 Further, it appears clear that aside from being horrible at managing data
 and the needs of the public, EIA is incompetent at analysis. I do not think
 we built inventory during 1Q01; it was mostly stocks (producer/distributor)
 moving to market. I now understand why you were focusing upon my gas
 substitution comments. The other area of opportunity is EXIM. No doubt you
 have continued to see the drift in international freight and coal prices.
 How low can it go (EXIM) - we are in unchartered territory! I know Hill &
 Associates think that the US can become an importer over the longer pull.
 The problem is the offloading at terminals (what you load, you can't
 necessarily offload) and whose terminals they are. Look at the ownership of
 the major terminals and you find coal producers.
 
 I have told our gas guys that I am growing more confident that gas will gain
 ground from coal this time around for the structural reaons I gave you plus
 the fundamental reasons as well. If today's AGA is bullish again, this could
 be the makings of an interesting market op.
