 
 I've been working pretty heavily. This past Sat I went to the Rennaisance Festival, which runs
 for about 7 consecutive weekends in the fall every year in the country north of Houston.
 It is set up like a huge medieval village with jousting, shops, etc. People dress up like elves,
 swordsmen, wizards, fairies. (I even saw a fat guy dressed as a fairy) People are really into
 it, and travel a long way to go.
 Have you seen the new Ford Thunderbird? Go online if you haven't, and have the big guy look
 at it, too. I think it looks pretty awesome, but I'm not sure it will be my next car.
 
 Love,
 Jason
 
  
     
 Hi Jason,
 We don't hear much from you these days.
  Did you watch the Cowboys game yesterday? I didn't know that Wright was
 out.
  We bought a digital camera Fri. so we're going to Jill's when she gets off
 work to take some pictures of Mikayl. I'll also make sure we take some
 pictures of him in his Halloween costume. I took a day off today. the
 weather has been really nice. I took some good pictures of Dad on his
 motorcycle.
  Better go and get ready to go to Jill's.
  Love, Mom
