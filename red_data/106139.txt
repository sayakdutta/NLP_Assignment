 
 Janie:  I prepared a format last week for Allegheny for use until the ISDA 
 Master Agreement is executed.  Let me know if you have any questions.

 Kim:  It looks fine, and, you should use this format until the ISDA is 
 executed.  We spoke with Allegheny this morning and they promise to execute 
 next week.

 Hi Sara,
 Attached are the changes you requested.  Shall I begin confirming all 
 Allegheny deals on this form until the ISDA is complete?
 
 Thanks for your help!

 Hi Sara,
 Ok, I think I have properly referenced the side letter in this confirmation.  
 Please let me know what changes should be made.
 
 P.S. I am leaving at noon today, so if I haven't heard from you by then, I 
 will give you a call tomorrow morning.
 Thanks!
