 Richard - please let us know if it makes sense for us to file anything in 
 connection with this motion.  (I would think probably not.)  Also, any luck 
 in getting the PX to set forth its position regarding release of collateral 
 in writing?

 SDG&E is planning to file a motion in Judge Moreno's court requesting an
 Order vacating (as moot) paragraph 6 of the Preliminary Injunction (which
 permits participants to withhold amounts previously paid in charge-backs
 from payments owing to the PX in connection with the normal invoicing
 process) and stating that SDG&E is entitled to the amounts it has withheld
 pursuant to paragraph 6.  SDG&E will argue that FERC clearly ordered the
 charge-backs to be rescinded, and accordingly, that the reason for the
 escrow no longer applies.
 
 Please let us know whether you have any comments and/or would like to join
 in this motion.
