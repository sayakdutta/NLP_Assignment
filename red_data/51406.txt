 
 Tom,
 
 Sounds great. There are some professors at UT who
 worked on automated trading systems. I shall review my files
 and try to locate the paers they sent me.

 Vince,
 
 Just to update you on how things are going with regard to EOL -
 
 I had a meeting with John Arnold yesterday to show him what had been 
 accomplished to date, and I think that he was fairly impressed by the 
 information available. I asked him for his input, and he expressed his 
 interest in having a couple of reports made up that couldn't be created from 
 the format the data was in. I spoke to Clayton about this, and he has already 
 made changes that will reflect a number of the modifications John requested.
 
 I am also continuing to research the issue of an automated trading platform 
 for EOL. I have some information about how the NASDAQ operates, and I have 
 looked at some websites for ECNs, such as Archipelago, Island and Instinet. I 
 have also had a look at the International Securities Exchange (ISE) web-site, 
 but they do not seem to explain much about their system. Any further 
 suggestions would be appreciated.
 
 I want to find out more about where EOL is currently and what modifications 
 may be necessary in the existing system, finish reading the material at the 
 websites I have investigated, and then I will try to put together a 
 presentation for you and/or Greg Whalley.
 
 Tom
