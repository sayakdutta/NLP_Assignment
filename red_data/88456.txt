 
 Sorry for the delay in responding.  Regrettably, I have a legal conference 
 that weekend and with dog logistics and all I cannot  see how it would be 
 easy to do.   Also sounds like you will be busy and it being balloon festival 
 it will be hard to get a room.  
 
 Let me know when you have some free time otherwise.   I can fly into Tulsa, 
 or NM on other date.  How is Jason's injury?
