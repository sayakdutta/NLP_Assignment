 Vince-
 
 George just "remembered" the traders' meetings Monday and Wednesday 
 afternoons at 3:30. He' s going to email you- I think Tuesday would ensure a 
 turnout of traders as well as analysts. We  could easily have 20 people there 
 from Power alone, and there's always Gas .... When you decide the time,  can 
 you ask Shirley to reserve a conference room along the size of 30C1?
