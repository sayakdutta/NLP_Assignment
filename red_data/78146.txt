 Kay:
 
 George Kutzschbach of Fulbright called this afternoon to request copies of
 the executed Assignment and Assumption Agreements and Bills of Sale for the
 turbine/transformer transaction between ENA and Sweetgum Energy LP.  George
 has unsigned copies of these documents.  Our closing volumes also contain
 only unsigned copies of these documents.   
 
 George is asking for the documents with respect to both the turbines and the
 transformer, but is needing them specifically for the transformer.
 Apparently, CA-II is planning to sell the transformer, and he is gathering
 up the documents that would show title to the transformer in CA-II.  
 
 I have reviewed the documents, and do not see any reason why we should not
 deliver them.  Can you provide signed copies of these documents?   Thanks.
