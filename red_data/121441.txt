 It sounds like there have been some changes in the settlements group that have resulted in a billing error for Smurfit.  My guess is they are using the spreadsheet rather than the SoCal Gas imbalance statement to set the volume.
 
 Can you please check and get back to John?

 Chris,
 
 Enron may have a new person in charge of SSCC Vernon's account now as there
 are billing differences once again. Hannah Nguyen was kind enough to send
 SSCC a bill for October 2001 for 68,243 mmbtu's of gas. The sum of the
 delivered volumes from Southern California Gas for the accounts SSCC Vernon
 is paying for seems to be closer to 108,975. Upon advising Houston of the
 additional payment that would be received for the underbilling, SSCC Vernon
 received a fax to the effect that actually 109,130 mmbtu's were due.
 
 It may be unclear that SSCC Vernon pays for delivered gas volumes, or the
 volumetric information SSCC faxed to Houston may not have been legible. In
 any event, attached is the e-file used for the calculation for Enron's
 review.
 
 Best regards,
 John Ewing
