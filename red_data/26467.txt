 There will be brief 15 minute presentations offered in the lobby today 
 walking you through,  step by step, entering your time in the new system. We 
 will have a learning lunch next week answering any questions that you still 
 have and walking you through it one more time.  The sooner you expose 
 yourself to your Timesheet in eHROnline the easier this transition will be on 
 all of us.
 
 Thank You!
