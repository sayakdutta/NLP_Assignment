 Jim -- The Michigan PSC just promulgated its electric code of conduct.  Attached is a copy of that code.  It requires that electric utilities and Alternative Energy Suppliers must file information that includes a legal address and party for service, organization chart showing utility affiliation.  For purposes of the Code utility includes providing regulated service and regulated service means that the rates are established by the Michigan PSC.  Thus, it does not appear that we have a conflict with either EPMI or our QF-owning affiliates regarding this code.  In those instances, regulated utilities may be our contractual counterparties but are not our affiliates.  MPSC approval of a QF's PPA should not elevate that agreement to the status of a regulated service.  If Enron bought a utility in Michigan this answer would obviously be different.  
 	For reasons similar to those regarding EPMI and the QFs,  EES should not present a problem either.
 	As history has shown, it is always good to check!

 Roy --
 
 What is MI doing on Code of Conduct?  Will we have any issues with EPMI supporting EES' entry?  Will our QF plants create any problems for EPMI and EES doing retail marketing?  
 
 Just checking.
