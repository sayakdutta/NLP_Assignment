 discussions with them about their authority.  Please send them the ISDA then 
 have them call Mary Cook to discuss the agreement.

 Hi Tana,
 
 The ISDA that I faxed you is not executable, can you send me one that is?

 Dave,
 
 Attached is the Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement.  The document you 
 faxed me was the preprinted form of ISDA Master Agreement.  That document, 
 TOGETHER with the attached Schedule is your full "ISDA Master Agreement".  
 Also attached to this Schedule is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty and 
 proposed form of Legal Opinion to be issued by Clark County PUD #1.
 
 It is my understanding that you will provide these documents directly to the 
 counterparty.  Again, the whole package above must be provided to the 
 counterparty or you will not have a complete set of documents.  Call me if 
 you have any questions.
