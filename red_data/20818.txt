 Good Morning My Sisters In Christ,
 
 I am writing you on behalf of a bridal shower that my sister wants to give me
 on Dec. 2nd at 6:30 pm. I want to extend an invitation to all of you who are
 interested in coming. For those of you that would be interested, I will need
 your address forwarded to Kathy (my sister) and copy me. Her email address is

 address. I would also appreciate it if you would get the word out to others
 that do not have email and to others that might be interested in coming. I
 was asked to get this information 2 weeks ago but I have been on the run so
 please forgive me for this late hour if you please. Thank you in advance for
 your response.
 
 Edith:-)
