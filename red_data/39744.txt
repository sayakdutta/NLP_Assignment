 I am actively pursuing have Duke Energy become an ISDA member this month.
 We are very interested in supporting the effort you mentioned at the
 October meeting to begin developing one universal master energy trading
 form.  Please keep me informed of future meetings, to insure our active
 participation as this effort develops.  Thanks.
