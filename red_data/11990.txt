 EOTT
 
 Started EPA 308 Request response Tuesday, September 4, 2001 at Russell, 
 Kansas and for EOTT releases in the Amarillo Region.  Large contingency of 
 employees worked jointly to provide files on each release experienced since 
 1998.  DES had Title V Operating Permits due so environmental coordinators, 
 Steve Mitchell and Monte Stebens, stayed in Russell until all files were 
 completed. DES would like to thank the environmental coordinators and all 
 other employees who worked on the information response.  Everyone did an 
 excellent job.
