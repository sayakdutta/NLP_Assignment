 
 First things first...
 
 Yes, I am still alive...Things with Wonder Boy suck (and for the time being I 
 think we should refrain from calling him Wonder Boy)...I'll be leaving for 
 Austin Friday night (1st football game of the season), but will be back 
 Sunday and definitely want to get together while you're in town.
 
 Hope all is well with you and that you had a fantastic holiday weekend.  Mine 
 was incredible!!! I visited a friend of mine in San Diego and had the best 
 time just hanging out, shopping, hitting the beach and attending the symphony 
 (on the water no less).  It was definitely a good trip for my psyche as Ted 
 has been less than impressive going on almost two weeks now.  I'm certainly 
 not pleased about the situation, but at no point have I lost site of what a 
 catch I am (and if he's not bright enough to see or appreciate that fact then 
 I don't think he's bright enough for me).
 
 Talk to you soon,
 Susan  
 
 Wit makes its own welcome, and levels all distinctions. No dignity, no
 learning, no force of character, can make any stand against good wit. -Ralph

 Hey there. Are you still alive? What is up? How are things with you and 
 Wonder Boy?
 I think I will be in Houston Friday through Tuesday (maybe more days 
 depending on how matters turn around). Will you be around?
 Drop a note when you get a chance.
