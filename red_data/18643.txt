 
 I've received a copy of the powerpoint presentation Hertzberg made to the his 
 caucus.  Unfortunately, it's a fax and hardly legible.  I can make out, 
 however, that it is the core/noncore plan.  I'm attempting to get a better 
 copy and will distribute as soon as I get my hands on it.  Please keep 
 confidential that we have a copy.  Thanks.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
