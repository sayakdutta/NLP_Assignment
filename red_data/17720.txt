   Cc: IEP Board of Directors
  RE: Legislative Status Report Week Ending 3/30
 
 
 RECENT EVENTS:
 
 -- SB 28x (Sher/Battin), which makes various changes to the siting process
 including many IEP-sponsored proposals, passed off the Senate floor last
 week 37 to 1.  Asm. Wright=01,s office is now working with the authors and =
 IEP
 to make additional changes to the bill, as opposed to moving more siting
 issues in AB 36x (Wright) (although that is still an option).  Chris Elliso=
 n
 and I are continuing to work with the authors=01, staff to develop addition=
 al
 language. The bill is scheduled to be heard on Monday in the Assembly Energ=
 y
 Costs and Availability Committee.  We are waiting to review new language
 from the author=01,s office.  At this point we are recommending the bill do=
 es
 NOT move forward without this additional language.  I will let members know
 the status of these amendments before the hearing.
 
 -- IEP has a meeting with the newly-elected Assembly Republican Leader Dave
 Cox (Sacramento) on Tuesday at 8:30 am to discuss the Republican=01,s posit=
 ion
 on siting and direct access, and possibly linking those issues with the
 passage SB 5x (Sher), the billion dollar energy conservation bill on the
 Assembly side.  Although they are not the only issues IEP and its members
 want resolved in this legislative session, they are currently the most
 visible and active issues with the best chance of passage.
 
 -- AB 60x (Hertzberg), which ties to the siting process the requirement tha=
 t
 a developer enter into a contract to sell power to specified California
 entities, is out of the Assembly on a 64 to 12 vote.  The bill will be hear=
 d
 in the Senate Energy Committee next.  IEP members have agreed on amendments
 to the bill which it will present to the Speaker, however, it and its
 members will be meeting with members of the Senate Energy Committee to stop
 the bill.  IEP=01,s opposition message is twofold: 1) the bill creates anot=
 her
 obstacle in the siting process when the state should be streamlining it;
 and, 2) as a net-importer, California would be sending the wrong signals to
 its neighboring states that send us power in our time of need.
 
 -- AB 8x (Migden), which would have given the EOB additional and undefined
 powers related to the coordination of operation and maintenance schedules,
 was gutted in the Senate last week and used as a vehicle for the State to
 get the generation component of the utilities=01, rates, the San Diego rate=
  cap
 extended to all customers, and kicking the QF issue to the CPUC.  AB 8x in
 its new form, authored by Assembly Member Keeley, passed out of the Senate,
 but failed to get enough Republicans to vote for the bill on the Assembly
 floor.  The biggest opposition came primarily from the gas-fired QFs which
 wanted to be exempt from the measure=01,s QF provisions.
 
 Migden=01,s office has communicated its intention to move forward with the
 language previously in AB 8x, although in a different vehicle not yet
 identified.  There remains a commitment on the table to meet with IEP to
 discuss amendments.  IEP member company lobbyists have agreed to continue
 lobbying her office to urge her to wait hearing the bill again until this
 meeting has happened.
 
 -- There appears as if there is going to be another attempt at moving QF
 legislation next week.  SB 66x (Bowen) was introduced on Wednesday in which
 a Senate Floor analysis was already prepared.  The measure is still in
 spot-bill format, but rumor has it =01&they=018 are working on language as =
 we
 speak.  Be prepared for anything.
 
 -- Senator Burton=01,s office is sending IEP another set of amendments
 attempting to solve our problem with the eminent domain provision in SB 6x
 (Burton), which is the state power authority measure.  I will report on the
 status of these amendments once we have had a chance to review them.
 
 -- SB 39x (Speier), which would define generators as public utilities and
 put the CPUC in the role of coordinating outages and maintenance schedules,
 remains on the Senate floor awaiting a vote.  There is no action item on
 this measure at this time.
 
 -- Regular session is getting under way in conjunction with the on-going
 special session hearings.  IEP has taken a support position on the followin=
 g
 bills which are scheduled for hearings next week:  SB 64x (Costa), which
 expands to Biomass-to-Energy grant program; AB 49x (Campbell), AB 226
 (Campbell), and SB 30x (Brulte), each of which would allocate property tax
 revenues from new power plants exclusively to the residing local government=
 ;
 and, AB 1138 (LaSuer), which in its introduced form would provide
 low-interest loans for repower projects and peaker plants, with specified
 conditions.
 
 --  Attached is the most recent legislative tracking reports, both the
 special session and regular session.  Please let me know if you need copies
 of any of these bills.
