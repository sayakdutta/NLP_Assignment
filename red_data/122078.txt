 FYI
 
 Pursuant to our conversation earlier today on the marketing strategy for incremental delivery capacity at SoCal Needles, Michelle and I researched the contracts with primary deliveries at PG&E Topock.  Following is a list of the discounted rate shippers to Topock:
 
 PG&E Trading
 40,000 MMBtu/d
 $0.10.75
 
 
 SMUD
 10,000 MMBtu/d
 $0.17
 
 (There are no shippers with EOC delivery points who would move their delivery point to Topock on a primary basis.)
 
 Attached is the contracted volume data for PG&E Topock from Pipeline Profile.
