 Maybe I'm not as original as I thought I was.
 
 Anyway, I think you've got it straight. Mollie is the administrative 
 assistant in charge of ordering and paying for season tickets for the 
 Origination group. I'm a trader's assistant  who once worked for Mollie and 
 stole the Blazer responsibility out from under her nose. We still cross paths 
 every now and then, so anything that comes to me will get to her. 
 
 Thanks for taking such good care of our sporting needs. And you have a great 
 weekend too. Don't forget to take a moment of silence for our past Presidents 
 on Monday.
