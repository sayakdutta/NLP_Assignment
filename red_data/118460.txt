 current maximum wind speed - right at the eye wall - which is well to the 
 south-east of St. Thomas.  The Weather channel this morning showed local 
 radar indicating a lot of rain in the US 7 BVI but the storm center was 
 pretty far away.  The real question is what direction will it go from here.  
 If it heads out to the north east as predicted, no problems.  If it takes a 
 turn to the north, direct hit.  I hadn't hard about the state of emergency 
 but that could be due to rain related damage.

 In case you need it to decipher some of the coordinates, the BVI is at 
 roughly 18 25' N 64 40' W
 St. Thomas is closer to 18 20' N 65 W
