 Kay,
 
 Attached is a redline of a CA between Mirant and ENA showing Mirant's 
 proposed changes.  Please let me know what you think about Paragraph 9 (Re: 
 Securities Laws).  Carlos is okay with everything, but had some comments 
 about Paragraph 9 as well.
 
 The CA is for Ben Jacoby and he is anxiously awaiting (not to be confused 
 with "patiently") legal's comments.  
 Thanks
 
 Kathleen
