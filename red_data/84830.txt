 Alstom agreement.

 The Alstom load is small.  It just peaks real fast and hard.  We don't need 
 SCADA here.  With the loss of the Wyman Gordon load, we will be left with 
 only the Cypress Fairbanks city gate and Alstom on the 12" (4007) line, so 
 line pack will handle whatever instantaneous pull Alstom should develop.
