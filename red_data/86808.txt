 in business (my words, not hers!).  I asked the kids about going ahead to 
 Brazil with y'all.  Michael will do whatever; Kali was a little hesitant.  
 When do you think you'll be coming here and when do you think you'll leave.  
 We'll need to coordinate the travel schedules.  We're going to use OnePass 
 miles for at least two tickets, so we'll need to finalize things in early 
 April to get seats.
 
 Talk to you soon.
 
 Susan
 
 P.S.-  Happy Birthday early!!
