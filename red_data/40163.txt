 the meantime, Sue and I can prolong having to produce the information until 
 we negotiate a confidentiality agreement.

  ubmitting Costand Supporting Data Docum
 
 
 Mary,
  One of the issues in January that helped us along the path of not
 reporting to FERC December over cap sales in addition to not being required
 yet under the tariff was the question of how to match cost to sales in
 California.  If the data is due tomorrow, we will need to decide how to
 resolve that issue first thing tomorrow.
 
 Thanks
 Gary

 The ISO is now saying that it has the authority to require EPMI to report
 our prices over the price cap pursuant to Section 4.5.1of its Market
 Monitoring Protocol.  This provision gives the Market Surveillance Unit
 very broad authority to request information, specifically: "the submission
 of any infomration or data determined by the Market Surveillance Unit to be
 potentially relevant by ISO Participants, the PX or other entities whose
 activies may affect the operation of the ISO market."
 
 Apparently EPMI had some December sales over the cap.  The FERC did not
 order us to report these December sales to FERC but the ISO is now
 requesting it.  I think our only available approach is to provide the
 information to the ISO pursuant to a confidentiality agreement.  I have
 asked Sue Mara if she would contact WPTF about negotiating a
 confidentiality agreement.  Richard, please advise if this is the proper
 course of action.  Please note, the information is due tomorrow.

 I agree with Dan.  Have we sold above the cap?  If so, report.  If not,
 tell them we will let them know when we do.----cgy

 If we haven't sold anything over the cap, then I would go with #3:  Report
 that we haven't and that we shan't report until we do.
 

 By a letter in early January, the ISO told EPMI that FERC's order accepting
 the ISO's Tariff Amendment No. 33 had ordered EPMI to report to the ISO
 transactions above the price cap.  We reviewed the FERC Order and concluded
 that the FERC had imposed no such obligation.  We decided to do nothing
 rather than explain this in a letter to the ISO because the letter could be
 quoted out-of-context in the newspaper.  Moreover, it's my understanding
 that we have done no transactions over the cap, so, even if the ISO has
 correctly interpreted the tariff there would be nothing to provide the ISO.
 
 The ISO is now threatening (see attached E-mail) to bring enforcement
 actions against parties that do not report to the ISO transactions above
 the price cap (whether or not the transactions are out-of-market).  I could
 do one of several things for you at this point:
    Stay quiet
    Send the letter (see attached letter to Eric Hilderbrandt)
    Send the ISO a letter saying we haven't sold anything over the cap and
    will not report unless and until we do
    Call the FERC hotline and ask them to get the ISO off our back
    Ask Sue or Joe to mobilize some action by WPTF or EPSA
 
 I am fearful that if we stay quiet, the ISO will put us on a list (like the
 "Dirty 13" list) and we'll end up in the press again.  To lay low, I'm
 inclined to pursue options 3 or 4.  What do others think?  Traders - please
 verify my understanding about our transactions with the ISO.
