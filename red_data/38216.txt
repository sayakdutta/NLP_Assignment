 
 Monte,
 
 Please scrub the prompt tab, phys index tab, fin index tab, and consolidated tab.  Make sure they all tie out to the hedge strips and sitara.  Shannon will give you a copy of my physical volumes from sitara.  We will go over it tomorrow.
 
 
 
 Shannon,
 
 Please run a new copy of all DEC positions for IM WC CAL and give it to Monte Jones.
 
 Thanks,
 Mike
