 
 A heads up -
 
 The Forward Obligation report for 3/28 will show Short Term Northwest with a 
 50 MWh short position off-peak at NP-15. This is due to an option that Sean 
 and Diana decided not to exercise. Thought that might clear up at least one 
 of the many discrepancies we may find on that report.....
