 
 Following are the prices for fixed sales between EPMI Short Term California 
 and EES for 1/25. Chris Mallory has turned this task over to me, and I'm 
 working from my own spreadsheet, which I inadvertently deleted this morning. 
 Please let me know if you'd like a copy of the spreadsheet as well as the 
 prices each morning, or if the prices are sufficient. 
 
 NP-15
  On Peak - $273.50
  Off Peak - $204.43
 
 SP-15
  On Peak - $216.53
  Off Peak - $189.35
 
 Thanks,
 Kate
