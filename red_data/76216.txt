 
 We expect to have a change order executed by ABB on Monday (Tuesday at the 
 latest) whereby we agree to pay all but the retainage amount, and they 
 acknowledge that we can assign it to WHOEVER, including the agent (right?).
 
 Ben and I discussed the fact that the Coral turbines will be moved into 
 TurboPark.  I believe we will want to assign the turbines to an Enron LLC the 
 following week. FYI, we have a conference call tomorrow to finish the binding 
 agreement to see them the turbines.  If it would work to keep them in WestLB, 
 that's great. However, I want to do whatever creates the least amount of 
 stress for you two.  I'll manage Coral and Ben.  Please advise.
 
 Ciao,
 
 Kay
 
 PS.  Just in case you don't know, your efforts are very appreciated.  Not 
 just by me!

 I spoke to Mike Sandridge. Rebecca, please contact JY Davis at ABB St. Louis 
 to answer Kay's questions regarding equipment status and the factory address. 
 Dennis Bowman will sign the change order in Sandridge's and Frank's absence. 
 His number is 314-679-4512. Mike will provide him, Frank, and Dave Onuscheck 
 a heads up.
 
 Ciao,
 
 Ben
