 Best,
 Jeff
 
  
     
 Article 2, Section 2.4 of the recent Settlement Agreement between SCE and CPUC states that SCE intends to apply to the CPUC for approval  to incur up to $250 million (recoverable in a tracking account) to acquire financial instruments intended to hedge fuel cost risks associated with its URG and QF contracts.  Any commercial opportunities there?
