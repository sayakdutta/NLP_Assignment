 
 I don't know if you saw my second e-mail, but I checked it out with Chris 
 Mallory, who did the deal, and he verified the price at $214.95. If Prebon 
 still disputes this, let me know and I'll have Mallory talk to Prebon.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate

 Kate Prebon shows $114.95 as the price and we show $214.95
 
 
 
 
 

 
   
  
 This is actually deal #471975, which I just fixed because Jeff forgot to put 
 the broker name in there. It is with Prebon.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate
