 
 We are getting close on this one relating to the Blue Dog turbines.  I'm 
 reviewing these drafts in detail, and expect that there will be another 
 turn.  Just wanted to give you a heads up.

 I am attaching for your review marked and clean copies of the following
 documents:
 
 1. Letter Agreement between Enron North America Corp. and NorthWestern
 Generation I, LLC;
 2. ENA Promissory Note (Exhibit A);
 3. First Amended and Restated LLC Agreement (Exhibit C);
 4. Escrow Agreement (Exhibit F); and
 5. ENA Guaranty (Exhibit G).
 
 In addition, I am attaching a preliminary draft of Enron's form of
 Assignment and Assumption Agreement (Exhibit B) with the caveat that the
 document remains subject to changes pending further review by Enron.  Please
 note that I am not attaching (1) a copy of the GE Guaranty (Exhibit E)
 because we are satisfied with Paul Hasting's draft of this document and (2)
 the LLC Promissory Note (Exhibit D) because Marguerite will circulate this
 document as soon as she is done preparing it.
 
 Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.
 
 Best regards,
