 Our understanding is that we'll need the electronic file you talked about on 
 Monday in order to do the first (optional) case (re: helpful questions and 
 spreadsheets).  But we haven't received the file yet.  Could you possibly 
 forward it to us?  We're leaning strongly toward writing the first case up 
 and turning it in and are anxious to get started.  Thanks very much.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
