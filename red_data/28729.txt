 
 I'm OK with it, thanks to some coaching from Jeff.  I would suggest that our 
 marketers specifically mention to all interested bidders (especially Texaco) 
 that the lottery tiebreaker is clearly identified in the posting and if they 
 want to be there to witness it they better call us because we don't send out 
 engraved invitations.  Good luck.  DF
