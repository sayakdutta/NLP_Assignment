 
 Leslie,
 
 Why am I getting this information below?  These counterparties are not on my 
 approval lists for the last few days.  Did Frank ask you questions re: the 
 counterparties below, and you just want me to put this info in the EOL Legal 
 Database?

 Frank:
 
 1.  Midland Cogeneration Venture Limited Partnership is not authorized to 
 trade any U.S. power products.  (We are currently in litigation with Midland 
 and are not trading with this CP.) 
 
 2.  Otter Tail Power Company -- Enron Sales only pursuant to on-line GTCs.  
 We do not have any trading agreements with this CP so it is not necessary to 
 send an override letter.
 
 3.  Florida Power Corporation and Carolina Power & Light Company -- Enron 
 Sales only pursuant to on-line GTCs.  Each of these CPs should receive an 
 override letter in the form attached below.
 
 
 
 Call me with any questions at *36121.
