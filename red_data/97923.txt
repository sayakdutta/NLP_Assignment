 Gentlemen - two items.
 
 First, HPL has been sued (filed but not served) in a very minor right-of-way 
 matter.  It is so minor I expect it can be resolved before plaintiff ever 
 serves.  What type of information/involvement, if any,  would you like to see 
 on this matter?
 
 Second, the big picture.  Since Mr. Hammer has moved on to better hunting and 
 fishing grounds, I now have overall responsibility of the GPG Law Operations 
 group.  What types of information/involvement would you like to see on any 
 HPL litigation that would be handled by operations?  We will, of course, keep 
 Mr. Schneider well informed since he is the client.  
 
 Thoughts??
