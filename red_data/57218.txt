 
 Debbie,
 
 This is an update on the continuing Winston saga. Tanya
 identified the sections of the code that produce inefficiencies
 but the rest is in the Winston's hands.
 
 Steve Stock is very cooperative and takes a very rational, Enron-first
 approach to the problem. Privately, my concern is that the code, based on 
 Tanya's
 report to me, leaves a lot to be desired. The code tends to be a very 
 mechanical
 implementation of the algorithm, developed without a series attempt to 
 optimize it.
 
 Let's keep paddling along.
 
 Vince

 Vince,
 
 ...just to keep you in the loop on the Tanya / Winston issue...

 Tanya,
 
 I just checked in with the contractors here.....and it looks like it might be 
 a good idea for you to spend about 30minutes with them to give you a guided 
 tour of their documentation.
 
 It's presented as a linked set of word documents and Visio drawing, with 
 links to all the reletive parts as hyperlinks. It's pretty good and I imagine 
 it will be very usefull to you, but probably requires a little introduction 
 first.
 
 Please feel free to come to my office whenever it is convenient. Even if I'm 
 not available, the guys are just outside my office and I can easily stop 
 whatever I'm doing to introduce you to the project manager.
 
 regards
 
 Steve
 
  
     
 Steve,
 - we spent about 5 fruitful hours with Winston last week.
 - I pretty much understand the data flow when the code runs.
 - I also got an idea where the time is spent during the execution of the code 
 by questioning Winston.
 I did not see any results of profiling the code. Winston's opinion is (as I 
 understood) that he knows how much time is spent 
 on different calculations and profiling is not easy to do, so we don't need 
 to do it. 
 - Based on above I suggested possible way to reduce the time credit model 
 takes to run and we discussed it with Debbie, who was
 going to arrange a meeting with Winston.
 - It might be useful to look at the Documentation created by contractors, if 
 you have it handy - send it to me, please.
 
 Thank you,
 
 Tanya.
 
 
 
     
 Tanya,
 
 how's it going with code-review from your perspective?
 
 ...did you manage to talk to our Documentation contractors?
 
 ...if not, would you me to arrange for them to bring you the documentation as 
 it currently stands?
 
 regards
 
 Steve
