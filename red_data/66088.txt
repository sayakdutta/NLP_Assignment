 
 i am not fighting with you at all.  you are just grilling me.  you are an angry person.
 
  
     
 whatever, i did not flip out.  i remember everything.  stop fighting with
 me.
 
 
     
 
 i was sober and i remember how it went down.  i said one rude thing in the
 car and that was it.  you were just going nuts and wouldn't let it die.
 you kept flipping out on me.
 
     
                 
    no, that's wrong.  you just kept saying one rude thing after another
    which
    bothered me.  it doesn't matter.  the point is that it should not be so
    difficult for you to not be rude.
 
    
                 
 
     only one thing i said was rude, which i apologized for, and you
    wouldn't
    let it die.  most of the stuff was started by you.  you were just
    venting
    frustration you weren't able to communicate when you're sober.
 
        
                             
       i only rolled back over once.  i said i was sorry for saying i wished
       you
       were dead, i was just kidding, and i wouldn't have to vent for so
    long
       if
       you wouldn't give me reasons to.  some of the things you said last
    night
       were pretty rude.
 
       
                             
 
       you kept rolling back over and laying into me.  you are the one who
    said
       you wished i was dead.  you went crazy.  you were pissed all night.
    you
       were venting on a soap box for about 2 hours.
 
           
                                         
          i was not going nuts.  i was trying to go to sleep and you kept
       bringing
          it
          up.  you're nice, but you have an attitude.  very cocky.
 
          
                                         
 
          i was being nice.  you kept starting it and then blaming it on me.
       you
          were going nuts.
 
              
                                                     
             you deserved it b/c you are a jerk.  you really need to start
       being
             nicer.
 
             

                                        
 
             you were letting me have it.  i deserved some of it b/c i made
       some
          bad
             jokes, but overall you were pretty brutal.  i think i am
    heading
       to
             baton
             rouge for the game this weekend instead of partying for
    halloween.
 
                 
                                                                 
                no.   why was i mad?
 
                

                                                 
 
                you still mad at me?  you were pissed last night.
 
                    
                                                                            Subject:
 
                   you better be getting excited about dinner.  i'm not
    taking
       you
          if
                you
                   aren't.
