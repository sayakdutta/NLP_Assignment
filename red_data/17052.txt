 assessment.

 From further discussions with UC/CSU, it appears their primary concern 
 relative to Enron's decision to De-DASR their accounts is that they have lost 
 their "direct access" status, and are again a bundled utility customer.  
 
 Jeff - what impacts does this status have with respect to the ban language of 
 AB-1X?  And with SB-27X, will they now encumber costs to become a direct 
 access customer that they would not have been liable for had Enron not made 
 the decision to return them to utility supply?
 
 Your input is appreciated.  Please shed some light here as soon as possible.
 
 Regards - Tom Riley
