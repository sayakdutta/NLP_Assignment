 
 I've sent JRigby the execution versions of the break out contract and the 
 override letter.  I've asked him to call me to discuss.
 
 FYI: The turbine contract was originally drafted by Brian Barto, then Kathy 
 Clark took over.  Scott Dieball (EECC Legal) was actively involved in the 
 negotiations, as was I. In facct, it was the first deal I worked on after I 
 transferred to ENA from EECC.

 No - he wants to see the breakout, but generally the commercial ts and cs are 
 the same.  The breakout should be different only insofar as technical-type 
 changes were made to accommodate a smaller "batch" of turbines and certain 
 other site-specific changes.  The "override" letter contains the financing 
 type changes that need to be in these "surrogate purchaser" deals.  The idea 
 is that once the financing entities are out of the picture and we want to 
 sell the facility, the breakout turbine purchase agreement can be assigned to 
 the new owner without the funky "overrride letter" requirements.
 
 
 Brett's question went to whether EECC would be critical of the commercial 
 deal terms, because, oddly enough, EECC has historically been the point 
 organization for all power asset purchases within Enron - whether the 
 purchase was ultimately for an ENA, ESA or EECC/NEPCO project.  In this case, 
 Brett can be assured that EECC had its input into the commercial terms last 
 May, when Kay Mann (ENA power development lawyer) worked with Katherine Clark 
 (an EECC contracts administrator) on the deal.
 
 Sorry for the confusion.
 
 Thanks,

 So he doesn't want to see the breakout?  Only the original purchase agreement?
