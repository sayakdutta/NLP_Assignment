 To clarify, the Edgecombe we were discussing is in North Carolina.  The New 
 York deal is a separate deal.
 
 Thanks,

 Lisa:
 One of Kay's developers wants to acquire a land purchase option in Edgecomb 
 County, North Carolina ("Edgecomb").  While I recall setting up Edgecomb for 
 you, I don't recall whether Edgecomb actually acquired land purchase 
 options.    Is this acquisition a coincidence?  Are we resuscitating an 
 asphyxiated deal?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Ed

 I have some folks who want to option some land in New York.  Do we have a 
 company for New York yet?  If not, I seem to recall that we were going to 
 start using one of the existing companies for land options instead of 
 creating a new one every time.  Am I remembering that correctly?  
 
 Basically I'm looking for the company name to use in an option.  Any 
 suggestions?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
