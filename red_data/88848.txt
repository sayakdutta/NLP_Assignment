 My name is Barbara Hammack and I am a new contract analyst at Reliant
 Energy, I am assuming the responsibilities of the desk that is handling the
 negotiations of the GISB with ENA Upstream.  From what I can gather in the
 pending file left at this desk, it does not appear that you were sent
 Reliant's Special Provisions to the GISB.  I have attached these Special
 Provisions, as well as, the comments our legal group has made regarding
 ENA's Special Provisions.
 
 If you have any questions or require further information, please feel free
 to call or email.
