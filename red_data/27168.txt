 Please see the attached file.
 
 It includes a screen print of the xml price curve and the deployment message.
 
 In my conversation with Pat Moast this weekend, I am concerned that we are getting deployed when we should not be.
 Today, (i.e. - 9/1/ 2001) the market clearing prices have been approximately $14 (1300HE) to $24 (1200HE) and we have been 
 getting deployed.  According to Allgowed at the Real-Time Desk at Ercot, we are getting the MCP when we are deployed.
 This brings up two questions.
 
 First, should we be getting deployed based on our Price Curve (see attachment for an example)?
 
 Secondly, are we getting the MCP or the Bid price within the Price Curve?
 
 Please contact us asap to rectify the problem.
 
 Sincerely,
 Joe Capassso
