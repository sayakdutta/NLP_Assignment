 sunday's if anything is hopping....

 Yes, lets continue to have the pre-meetings formerly known as Mike's every 
 Mon. at 8:30 (pls put on my calendar Emily).  I'll be in Houston this Monday 
 so just come to my office at 8:30 if you are both here.  Dot, pls cover the 
 staff meeting on Monday, April 9 as I'll be on vacation.  Also, pls cover the 
 Derrick large GC meeting at 9:00 am on April 12 as I'll be at NN's Keyex 
 meeting in Cal.  (I may be able to call in to this but would like you to 
 cover anyway in case something goes haywire). Thanks df 
 
 
    
  
 
  If Mike has "checked out", will he then not be here on Monday at 8:30 for 
 pre-Stan meeting, or what?  Should I just 
  call Drew?   When?
