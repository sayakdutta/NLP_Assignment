 I am out that day, but I can give my comments to Mitch or listen via conf 
 call.
 
 



  
 John Moore is unable to attend the meeting scheduled for Thursday at 9:00 
 a.m., so we were wondering if you guys would be available at 9:00 a.m. on 
 Friday.  Please let me know.  Thanks, Suzanne, x37340 or via email

 In an effort to pull the pieces together, a meeting has been scheduled to 
 discuss the draft energy and capacity contract (formerly the PPA).  It is 
 scheduled for Thursday, August 24th, at 900am.  We are still in the process 
 of locating a conference room, so the location is TBD.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay

 Some of you may have received this already.  I have not compared it against
