 
 Per my conversation with Edmund this morning, we are moving Germany to the 
 approved list for trading credit derivatives.  Below is the list, now updated 
 to reflect this change.
 
 European jurisdictions which are are approved for trading credit 
 derivatives:  Finland, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and the U.K..
 
 The European jurisdictions which are not approved to trade credit derivatives 
 include:  France, Gibraltar, Ireland, Italy, Scotland, Spain, and The 
 Netherlands.   For banks incorporated in a non-approved jurisdiction, it may 
 be possible for them to trade out of a branch located in an approved 
 jurisdiction (i.e. U.S. and U.K. branches).   This would have to be 
 determined on a case by case basis.
 
 Canada is also not an approved jurisdiction for credit derivatives.
 
 Please let me know if there are any changes to this list.
