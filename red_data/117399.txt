 on it before it will go away or does it appear in a pop-up box that has to be 
 acknowledged?

 Teresa,
 
 Further to our conversation, please use the following for the ticker messages 
 for Price Limit Order events:
 
 
 Ticker Message for expired PLO:
 
 "Expired: Price Limit Order entered at [time] has expired without execution"
 
 
 
 Ticker Message for credit failure:
 
 "Transaction Failure: Price Limit Order entered at [time] has been rejected 
 due to credit limitations"
