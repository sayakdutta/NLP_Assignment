 No, we have not heard from the Office again.  Word has it that the Minister will soon be relieved of his duties, and hopefully the whole issue will be buried.   I will keep you posted.
 
 
 
 
     
 Thanks. Have we heard anything more?

 Richard,
 
 As per Michael's request, in order to preserve the confidential nature of the matter, I am sending you Guido Tawil's invoice for his work in reference to the recent Anti-Corruption Office request for information. 
 
 Best Regards,
 
 
 Andrea
