 Here is the mock up of the Star Wars invitation.  There are a few tweaks, but 
 this is essentially what it will look like.  Michelle

 I just received the last catering proposal, so I am working on the cost 
 estimate and should have it completed this afternoon.  Attached is a proof of 
 the animated invitation.  Let me know what you think.
 Thanks.
  
 
  
     
 Dorie, We put out our "save the date" email, and there is good buzz on the 
 event.  In your voice mail, you mentioned that you would have menus and 
 invitations ready this week.  I am only here a half day tomorrow and then out 
 all next week, so I am ready to see that stuff today, if possible.  Thanks!  
 Michelle

 Wanted to let you know the status on the following:
 Working with Ivy Bradberry (with the Image Center) on the cost & production 
 of the animated invitation.
 Should have all catering proposals by Tuesday, June 5.
 I will have a cost estimate and approval form prepared for you no later than 
 Wednesday, June 6.
 
 Questions for you:
 Do you have any idea how many children are expected?
 What was the final decision on the starting time for the program?
 
 Thanks.
