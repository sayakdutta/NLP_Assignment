 The ENRON window for responding to the two staff data requests is rapidly 
 closing.  Final staff testimony will be this Friday.  In order to coordinate, 
 facilitate, and review our submittal, a team meeting is scheduled today at 
 1.00 pm in room EB2934.  Please let me know your availability.
 
 Thanks for your help,
