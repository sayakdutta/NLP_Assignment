 
 I am having lunch on Monday with Michael Isikoff, a newsweek investigative 
 reporter.  He is doing yet another Ken Lay/Enron political influence story.  
 One of the things he wants to talk about though -- and I think this is a good 
 sign -- is Enron's climate change policy and how it compares to the 
 administration's.  What I need from you, as soon as possible, is a timeline 
 (what the Administration said when -- doesn't have to be down to the day); 
 the Administrations position; and our position (and how they differ).  Borrow 
 heavily from existing materials.
