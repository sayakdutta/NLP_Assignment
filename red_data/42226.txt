 Juan,
 Looking at my schedule, I could take off my days on Saturday the 21st and 
 Sunday the 22nd and work days on Thurs & Fri the 26 & 27.  I can't take 
 Monday the 23rd because there are only two of us on that night.  I would be 
 very happy to make this change.  Please let me know ASAP if this is 
 acceptable so I can make the appropriate plans.
 
 Doug
