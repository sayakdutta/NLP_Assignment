 Dear All,
 ?
 Would like to set a conference call to discuss  content for the panel 
 discussion at Risk 2000 in Boston on 14 June. Perhaps I  can suggest 
 wednesday 31 may at noon EST. I'm on London time and am quite  flexible if 
 you would like to do earlier or indeed on another day.
 ?
 The panellists are -
 ?
 Vince Kaminski, Enron Corp
 Richard Jefferis, Koch Energy Trading
 Steven Bramlet, Aquila
 ?
 The discussion topic is 'effectively applying  weather derivatives'
 ?
 I think we need to establish a series of  questions around which to 
 facilitate discussion. We currently don't have a  moderator and perhaps one 
 of you could take this role on.
 ?
 I look forward to hearing from you.
 ?
 Thanks, Oliver
