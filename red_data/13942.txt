 Q:  I am on a H1-B Visa.  What assistance is the company providing me?
 A:  Enron is required to pay for a one-way, coach ticket for the employee only.  Please contact ______ for necessary arrangements.
 (Michelle, what else can we say about timing, when we submitted names to the INS, etc?
 
 
 Q:  Will I be able to receive severance in the future if I file for unemployment?
 A:  There is no company offset for State unemployment benefits against the $4,500.  You are able to file for unemployment immediately after your termination date.  If you receive additional severance in the future, it will be offset by any unemployment wages you have received.
 
 
 Q:  Will I be paid for any unused vacation? (we've already answered this broadly, but are getting a ton of specific questions around vacation now b/c they are thinking that it is being treated as an expense)
 A:  The $4,500 payment included payment for all pre-petition compensation including unused vacation time, WARN notification, and incentive and overtime pay.  Employees are entitled to pursue any claims for amounts in excess of $4,500 in the bankruptcy proceeding.  The link for the claim form is included below.
