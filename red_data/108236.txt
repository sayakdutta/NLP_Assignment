 I will call them today to get a separate id for you.  EGM is covered in the 
 ENA agreement, so you guys are fine.  It should take them about a day to get 
 a new id for you.  I will push them to get this to me by tomorrow.  I will 
 give you a call as soon as I get it.

 I'd like access for me.  I think the crude and products guys are looking at 
 it, so I don't understand that we haven't signed a participant agreement.  
 Thanks.

 In order to manage the enrollment of users onto this system, all users must 
 enroll via eRequest.  The approval process will mimic that of EnronOnline.  
 The requester will go to our internal security application (eRequest) and 
 search on ICE.  They must select the products they want to trade - ICE offers 
 gas, power, oil and metals.  This will then generate a message to the 
 applicable desk head for approval, and generate the appropriate message to 
 security to install the application needed to run the ICE.  Once this is 
 approved, Stephanie Sever (x33465) will coordinate getting user ids from the 
 ICE.  This normally takes a couple of days.  As soon as we get user ids and 
 passwords, we will notify the applicable individual.  
 
 To date, the entities that have signed Participant Agreements are ENA, EPMI 
 and ECC.  The cost is $500 per month per user on the ICE.
 
 Please call me if you have any questions.
