 financial incentive for us to have a witness, and I'm still struggling to 
 find the value.  As for the "save the planet" crew....I'm as concerned as you 
 are.  I'll try to make sure that Kaufman's on (who's a lawyer and is 
 considerably more to our thinking than to Mike's, Roger's or Stoness'.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Jeff - regarding the call tomorrow afternoon on witness/issue strategy, hope 
 you can be on.  We talked about this today with Mike and Roger.  The single 
 issue we may need to cover is DA's access to retained generation (as a proxy 
 for the PX calculation issue.)  I am very sympathetic to your arguments about 
 minimizing Enron face time before the Commission.  Mike does favor putting on 
 witness(es) and Roger, Scott and crew think it's our opportunity to save the 
 planet.  We need to have some potential witnesses in mind.  Weisenmuller?  
 Any legitimate California academic types who have credibility here and could 
 take the high road on this issue?  If you can talk with me prior to the call, 
 page me at 888 397-3996.  I will also leave a message with Paul Kaufman to 
 encourage his participation on the scheduled conference call.
