 Sara,
 
 As previously discussed, attached for your further handling is the form of 
 Information Sheet (for Canadian Utilities).  The attached form incorporates 
 the suggested changes made by the Canadian law firm of Blake, Cassels & 
 Graydon.
 
 Please advise if I may be of further assistance.
