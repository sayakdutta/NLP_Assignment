 
 These are Monday dates.  With the original date being October 2, a Tuesday, I just wanted to double check the dates with you.  Unfortunately, neither date works for me.  I am taking the day off on the 8th - Meagan has a school holiday and we will be in Dallas for Mustang Monday at SMU.  The program there ends at 3:00 or 4:00 in the afternoon, and we will have driven to  Dallas, so I can't make it work to be in Austin that evening.  And on the 15th, I have a monthly National Charity League meeting.  As president-elect, I am trying to make all of the meetings.  If it turns out that the intent was a Tuesday night meeting, the 9th or the 16th would work - 16th being the best because we will be in Austin for interviews!  --Sally

 We have the option of rescheduling the NetImpact presentation for either October 8 or October 15.  Is either date acceptable for your schedule?
 
 Thank you!

 Hi Lexi,
 
 I'm sorry about rescheduling the presentation and thank you for your

 Please tell me which one would work best for you all and whether you would
 like to continue with a presentation or company night.

 Thank you and see you soon!
