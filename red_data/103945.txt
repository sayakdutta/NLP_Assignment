 sorry i did not get a chance to revert back to you earlier.  was out in new 
 york.
 ok -- i will work on getting resources to help.  
 however, could you confirm with everyone that you have NO OTHER deals other 
 than what jill has listed?  preferably before our meeting this afternoon?
 many thanks.
 
 
 

  
  
 All:  I am comparing this list to mine but Jill's certainly looks more 
 comprehensive!  Jill said she may not have signed confirms, etc. but we 
 should get copies of all live equity deals.  I don't have paralegal 
 capability for this work at the moment.  Sara
 
 Julia:  Could you please call me when you receive this message?
