 I usually send these directly to the customer unless you prefer otherwise, so 
 I will also need an email address or telephone and fax number.  I also need 
 to know whether you want a bilateral form of non-disclosure agreement or a 
 one way form that protects Enron only.  In circumstances where we are certain 
 Enron will be the only party providing confidential information we prefer to 
 use that form.  Also, I need to know the nature of the confidential 
 information you are discussing so we can protect the information being 
 discussed.

 This is still the case.  
 
 Please copy Tana Jones on the information and she will generate the 
 agreements for our use.
 
 Thanks.

 I need two non-disclosure agreements before sharing our DocuLogic functional 
 requirements document with an external consulting company with expertise in 
 building document management systems.  Can you make these for me, or should I 
 approach IT's contracts department?
 
 Last time I had them made, Enron required (1) official name of company, (2) 
 state of incorporation, (3) principal address of business, (4) name/title of 
 their authorized signatory.  Is this still the case?
