 Elena Chilkina can give you historical data.
 Historical fwd curves can be obtained from Paulo
 or Alex, among others. Of course, our internal forward curves
 represent a very sensitive information.

 Hi Vince
 
 Who should I contact for power queries now Grant has gone?  A colleague here 
 in London (Didier Magne) is giving a talk on power/gas arbitrage, and the 
 consequent convergence of these markets.  
 
 Do you have any presentations on this area, or illustrative figures on the 
 increase in power/gas correlation?
 
 Many thanks,
 Steve
