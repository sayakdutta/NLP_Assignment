 
 Lisa,  I feel so bad right now.  I never wanted anything but to be with you 
 and love you the rest of my life.  I wish we knew how important it was to 
 communicate with each other over the past years.  I think we are both guilty 
 of not communicating.  It is easier to talk to some besides each other about 
 certain things because of certain expectations or assumptions that have been 
 built up over our portion of a lifetime together.  It hurts to now clearly 
 understand this after things have happened.
 
 I am scared of you moving in with Chris because I fear that we both may 
 accept it as final.  I don't want it to be that and I want us to genuinely 
 work on this relationship.  I want us to talk and do things together.  You 
 are my one true love.
