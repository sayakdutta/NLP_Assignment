 Dear Adjunct Professors and Lecturers,
 
 Gil Whitaker would like to invite you and a guest to a breakfast on
 Wednesday, May 30, 2001.  This breakfast is to celebrate the 25th
 anniversary of the first graduating class, to celebrate the end of the
 school year and to allow all of you the opportunity to hear about the state
 of the school.
 
 The breakfast will be in Farnsworth Pavilion from 8-10 am.  Farnsworth
 Pavilion is in the Ley Student Center.  It is the meeting room on the side
 closest to the new Jones School.  It is a casual event.
 
 Please RSVP to Maya Houston by May 25th.
 
 Thank you,
 Maya
