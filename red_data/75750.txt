 to sign?

 Kay:
 
 Per your request, enclosed is a proposed letter to SEL enclosing the final
 facility agreements.  I have included a "receipt acknowledged" signature in
 the proposed letter, although I believe this is optional as long as our
 courier, upon delivery, obtains a signature acknowledging receipt.  Please
 advise of any comments.  Thank you.
