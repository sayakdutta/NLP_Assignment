 John,
 
 Per your and Jeff's request, Research and Market Risk Groups have conducted 
 an extensive analysis of the forward-forward vol methodology used in the 
 Value-at-Risk calculation. 
 
 We analyzed and compared two methodologies: 
 
  the existing methodology - based on forward (implied) vols
  an alternative methodology - based on historical vols
 
 I would like to schedule about 30 minutes to walk you through the pros and 
 cons of each methodology and get your input.
 
 Vlady.
