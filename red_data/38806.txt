 
 Hey there.  I am back and at work today.  Thank you for the phone calls and 
 sorry I didnt return them but I was just entirely to busy and recieved too 
 many calls to return them all until I came home.  I hope everything is going 
 well for you.  We will have to get together and grab a bite to eat or a beer 
 or something this week.  How was your weekend?
