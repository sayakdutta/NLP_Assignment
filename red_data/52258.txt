 
 Ed,
 
 Thanks for your message. I appreciate your kind words
 and your concern.
 
 I cannot open the file you sent me. Can you resend it as a .doc
 or .pdf file?

 Dear Vince,
 
 We've been asked by our clients for our view on Enron's situation and
 outlook. I feel a need to respond to these requests and have written the
 attached one-pager.
 
 I would like to offer you -- my primary contact at Enron -- an opportunity
 to review and correct any factual errors. Interpretations, of course, remain
 my responsibility.
 
 I reiterate my long-standing admiration for the Company and all it has
 contributed. I have had an opportunity to discuss the prospect with people
 in policy positions and desire first of all to do no harm by misstatement
 and second to be as helpful as I can be.
 
 If you choose not to comment I will understand that as well, but would
 appreciate some indication on your part. I will of course keep our
 correspondence on this between us in any event. Thanks.
 
 Ed
