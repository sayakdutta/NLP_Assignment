 
 Alison,
 
 My group needs generally people with advanced skills in mathematics and 
 programming.
 I shall try to help you by forwarding your resume (with your permission) to 
 other
 units of Enron. Please, let me know if it's OK with you.

 Dear Vince,
 
 When we talked last, you mentioned you were considering making additions to 
 your office staff.  If you are still considering these additions, I would 
 like to talk to you and see if there might be a place for me.  It would be 
 wonderful to work with a group such as yours.
 
 It has been great working in recruiting, but the time has come for me to try 
 something else.  I am beginning to look around, but wanted to talk to you 
 first.  If my skill sets match a position you might be adding, please 
 consider me.  I have attached my resume so that you will have an idea of what 
 I have done.
 
 Thank you for your consideration.  Have a great Thanksgiving!
