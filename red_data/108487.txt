 
 Are you also coordinating this with hunter and his available analysts who you 
 think are good?

 Jana - Jennifer Fraser is in need of ten analysts to rotate into her group 
 (Fundamentals which is a core training area) in EGM over the next few 
 months.  Her greatest need is for two analysts, one in November and one in 
 December with the remainder being spread out in early 2001.  Could you send 
 her resumes of potential analysts who would fall into that category?  
 Thanks.  Ted
