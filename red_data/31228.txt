 Linda and Sylvia....this is the counterparty that we spoke about yesterday 
 that we have not yet received the signed consent form on so that all trades 
 done prior to January (settled in January) need to settle through the CES - 
 Cove Point......any additional info you have on this?   Are the 3 storage 
 contracts new in 2000 and would be as Cove Point....where as December trades 
 settle as CES - Cove Point when the consent has not been received....your 
 thoughts?...mgg

 I understand we have the CES Cove Point  storage contracts set up as CES-Cove 
 Point in global.  What is the status of the paperwork and who is following up 
 on it.  Whent I look on Cove Point's website, I show that Enron North America 
 now has 3 storage contracts.

 Per Sherry, Global Counterparty is recognizing CES - Cove Point as the 
 counterparty  instead of Cove Point for the January payment.  
 The reason is lack of the appropriate paperwork executed by the 
 counterparty.
