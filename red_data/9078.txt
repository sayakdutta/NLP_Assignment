 
 To give you more clarity, Stephen transferred to EBS effective July 1, 2000.  
 His move to EBS was agreed to earlier in 2000, with the understanding that it 
 would be effective upon the completion of the SAP implementation for ENA on 
 July 1.  Stephen was playing a critical role in ENA to insure a smooth 
 transition for SAP, and Todd Lindholm at EBS was in agreement that Stephen 
 would remain an ENA employee through implementation, with his performance 
 review being based on his work for ENA.  Stephen is very talented and will no 
 doubt do a great job at EBS.  During the first 6 months of 2000, however, his 
 heart was already at EBS and he failed to communicate with my other direct 
 reports on SAP issues, consistently missed my staff meetings, recruited our 
 other key SAP expert to EBS without a back-up plan for ENA, etc.  It was his 
 failure to make his SAP assignment a priority that landed him in the Needs 
 Improvement category relative to other directors on my team.   It is the r
 elativity of his performance that is key, not necessarily the label of that 
 category.
