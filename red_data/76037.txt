 I will review it tomorrow and touch base with you or Kay.  I will be at a
 closing the next two days, which has tied me up for weeks, but 99% of the work
 for it should be done today.  That will give me time to focus on this.  I will
 call tomorrow.

 Kay Mann passed along your e-mail address when I asked about how I could be
 of help in moving the Facility Agreement "breakout contract" forward.
 
 I am working on a transaction that will require that we have the ability to
 move two of the ten transformers Enron North America, as agent, purchased
 from ABB.  The transaction is expected to be signed prior to the end of the
 year.
 
 The counterparty to our transaction has pressed us for a copy of the
 contract under which the transformers will be conveyed.  I understand that
 you have been working with Kay on the form of contract.  To the extent that
 I can provide any input or can otherwise move the process along, I am
 anxious to do so.
 
 Please give me a call to discuss how we can move the process forwards.  I
 can be reached at (503) 464-8863.
 
 Thanks.
