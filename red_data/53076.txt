 Thanks for your kind offer.
 Please, get in touch with us when you come to Houston. 
 We may not be around much longer.

 Hi Vince,
 
 How are you? I will be back in Houston for December break as well as the
 
 month of January. If the group is in need of any help, I will be more than
 
 happy to work with or without pay in the month of January.
 
 Hope to hear from you soon.
 
 Candice
