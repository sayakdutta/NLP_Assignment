 Hello Michelle and Lizzette,
 I wanted to touch base with both of you before the approval deadline (tomorrow, November 15th) for the EEO and Harassment Prevention policies.  If you have additional revisions/suggestions that you would like to submit, please let me know.  
 
 Thanks in advance for your assistance!
