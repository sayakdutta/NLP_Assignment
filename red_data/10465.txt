 Lynn,
 
 On Aug 14, Ranelle Paladino told me that Dari and herself would be preparing a letter to terminate the Mountain Energy contracts due to their inability to demonstrate creditworthiness.  I was suppose to receive a copy of the letter by now.  I will contact Ranelle.

 FYI
 
 As you know, Mountain Energy Corporation, a shipper on NNG, filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy.  They have three small reservation invoices each month totaling together less than $2000 per month.  
 
 Per Dari Dornan's instructions, I mailed them a certified letter to demonstrate creditworthiness on July 12.  Mountain (or someone) did receive the letter on July 18 and did not respond to Paul Cherry nor I by July 26, as stated in the letter.
 
 Ranelle Paladino and Dari will working with Michele Winckowsi in Certificates to terminate these contracts.
 
 
 
 Larry
