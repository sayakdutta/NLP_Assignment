 Dear Peter,
 
 We are very happy with your suggestion and we would like to propose that the
 presentation also includes the interactions between power and gas trading
 and access to networks, since the conference is about the convergence of
 these two sectors.
 
 We would be very greatful if you could identify the speaker and the title of
 the presentation during the following days so that this can be included in
 the programme as soon as possible and go for final printing.
 
 What do you think about a title like?: Trading of gas and electricity and
 access to networks : what does the California experience learn us?
 
 Best regards and thank you agan.

 Reverting to you after some delay, Ana, I confirm our willingness to
 provide a senior speaker. We may be able to secure a Houston-based
 corporate executive level Managing Director if you can give us the latitude
 to introduce the subject of experiences in California and lessons for the
 European power markets. This would still be a trading and wholesale
 perspective, and indeed the lessons relate partly to issues of power
 imports and exports across state boundaries. What do you think?
 Regards,
           Peter.
