 
 OK, here's my 2 cents' worth:
 
 Avale Corp.
 I also like Enable.
 I think either one would look fine on an EBB list of customers...
 
 Also -- any name we choose could include the words Capacity Management.  But 
 I'm not sure we want to or need to be that descriptive.

 Here's my best shot(s):
 
 
 NatCom Energy Services, Inc.
 
 Streamline Energy Services, Inc.
 
 Handyman Energy Services, Inc.
 
 Enable Energy Services, Inc.  (var. Enerable)
