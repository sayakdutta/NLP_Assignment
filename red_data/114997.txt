 
 I'd like to enroll in the Enron Savings Plan program; however, when I was 
 navigating through the savings plan website, I started wondering if the 
 retirement plan and the self-directed brokerage account are the same thing. I 
 think you probably have some information regarding these plans. Could I 
 borrow that later this afternoon, or even better, sit down with you for a 
 minute to clarify which plans I am eligible to enroll in and when? Thanks in 
 advance for your time.
