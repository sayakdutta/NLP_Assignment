 
 I am still tracking down the Green Mountain documentation, but here is the documentation for LCRA.  I'll forward the rest when I get it.
 
 Thanks,

 I need to get with you regarding the existing schedule C I have for LCRA and for green mountain. I believe market conditions may have changed sufficiently that we can release some of it but I want to reaffirm this by researching the reasons again.
 
 Trust you are well.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Doug
