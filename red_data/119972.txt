 She likes white wines like white burgundy--I don't know any of the exact 
 ones, but I can find out if you want me to.
 
 Another idea she would really like is a gift certificate to the Taste of 
 Texas.  She went there recently for the first time and really enjoyed it.

 We are trying to think of something nice to send to Patti to show her our 
 appreciation for her hard work.  I was thinking of a gift basket from SPECS 
 with some nice wine.  Can you tell me what kind of wine she likes or suggest 
 another alternative for a gift that she may enjoy.  Thanks.
