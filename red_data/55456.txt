 7am at Hyatt Regency Downtown would be perfect. I will see you in the lobby
 at 7am.
 
 Best regards, Dale
 

  
 
 
 Dale,
 
 Friday is a bad day (Performance Review Committee all day).
 What about 7:00 at the office or breakfast meeting at 7:00? We can meet
 at Hyatt Regency Downtown (Smith Street).

 Can we get together Friday morning July 7 at 800 am at your office?  That
 would be particularly convenient for me.  I will have to leave downtown at
 about 945 to catch a plane.  That will ensure that I wont take up too much
 of your time!!  Thanks for your efforts here, and thanks for being patient
 with me.
