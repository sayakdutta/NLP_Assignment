 a good opportunity for ECT to speak.  Mark

 Mark,
 
 Would any of your colleagues be interested in speaking in Singapore in
 September on the Global Energy Derivatives Market (see the attached
 invitation).  None of the ISDA staff can speak at this conference because
 our September Board meeting will be held the same week.
