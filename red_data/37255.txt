 
 This is a physical deal.  Leg 4 is unwinding Leg 1.  Leg 1 had the Price and 
 Basis components and Leg 3 had the Index component.  I am in Chicago today 
 and tomorrow.  If you have any further questions, please let me know.

 Darron:
 
 Leg 4 of this deal is in TAGG as a physical swap instead of a physical 
 forward.  Is this a physical or financial deal?
 
 Thank you:
