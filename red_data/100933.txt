 Thanks for the prompt response.  Sorry you won't be able to make it, but I 
 will definitely keep you posted regarding any future group outings 
 (especially since I still owe you a beer).  Glad you liked the quote, it does 
 provide a good chuckle.  
 
 If I'd have known you were going to be in London this week I would have 
 forewarned Katy and Emily as they're both over there now as well - I assume 
 you're there for work though and therefore a tad busy.  Anyway, hope you're 
 having a good time and not working too hard...
 
 Susan

 Susan,
 
 Hope you are well.  Unfortunately I will not be able to participate.  
 I will not return from London until Friday (maybe Thursday night).  
 Keep me posted for the weeks ahead.  Love the quote--and I 
 agree whole-heartedly.
 
 --Darren
