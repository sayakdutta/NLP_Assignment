 
 I love you.  You are mine then for lunch on Wed.  We can discuss a place later.
 
  
     
 re lunch.  i can do any day next week except mon or tues.  and any day the following week.
 
 actually, they made me an offer on monday, 4/01 and i left on holiday on tuesday.  i did go in that tues am to see if i could get more $ from them, of course the pay/bo is less than here.  they didn't think there was anything they could do.
 
 got back into office on wed.  played phone tag all wed.  they called me thurs [yesterday] right before lunch and said could give me a very nice sign on bonus...but nothing more to my base pay.  thought hard about it, and decided to accept, which i did yesterday.  they sent a letter over this pm and then went in to talk to jesus.
 
 i am part of the liquidation pool, but do not feel comfortable at all that they are really going to pay me.  you know, if we sell $3 B you get xxx.  but there is no way we are going to sell exactly $3B.  and you have NO IDEA what you get if they sell $2 B or $3.5B.... and there is way too much loosiness involved in all of this, no letter stating anything, plus no trust on my part, that i don't think they will come thru.  and of course, now you have the SEC thing going on.  grrrr.
 
  
     
 nope and nope
 
 Baby is due May 7th but my womand is HUGH and I don't think she's gonna make it.  Kathy just told me.  I'm happy for you.  Did you listen to the retention talk first or were you already out the door mentally?
 
 I wanna do lunch with you.  When can you pencil me in?  I'm out next Friday and half of next Tuesday.
 
  
     
 gosh, i was going to email you, but i suppose kathy beat me to it.  are you married yet?  or a daddy?
