 Thanks for the clarification.  I guess I was too serious and in a business 
 mode.  By the way, I don't have any photos, all they would do is scare 
 people, especially me.

 God, or Mike I mean to say-
 
 I think I may have confused you a little. I don't think we need a picture of
 you presently (unless you have any nudes, especially a picture of you with a
 morning missile). What I was trying to say was that I saw one or more
 pictures of you in the brochure the actives prepared for last year's
 President's Trophy competition. What I was hoping was that the actives could
 have some more of those brochures printed up for distribution. You might
 enjoy a copy. I'm not sure, but I assume they will do another one next year.
 If so, they might appreciate a new photo if they include an alumni section.
 It is basically their deal. The alumni did not help them on this project.
