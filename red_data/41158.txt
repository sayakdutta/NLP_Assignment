 Pursuant to Sara Shackleton's request, I am attaching for your review a proposed Second Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement amending the existing amendment to change the Part 4 section references.  Please advise if the attached document is acceptable, and I will have two copies signed and forward to you for execution by Bank of America.  Please do not hesitate to contact us with any questions or comments.
