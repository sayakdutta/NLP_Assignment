 
 Steve,
 
 Sorry for the slow response but I got the latest word on voicemail while out 
 here in SF.  They completely screwed up my order, not Ron the guy from 
 Mercedes USA, but the dealer.  Ron has stepped in and followed up himself and 
 I'll be receiving a 2001 in late August/early Sept..  He is a good guy and is 
 trying to make up for the major dropping of the ball.  My sales guy that blew 
 it is no longer in that job.  Hopefully it will be coming soon.  I'll believe 
 it when i see it but I am very excited and it was a real let down in June 
 when it didn't' arrive.
 
 Thanks for asking.
 
 We'll talk soon.
