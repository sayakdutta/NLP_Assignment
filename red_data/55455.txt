   The eThink Team

    
 
 We recently asked you to create an eSpeak "wish list" for us.  The response 
 was tremendous and, in some cases, very creative.  Your fellow employees 
 asked for everyone from Britney Spears to George Bush.  In all, we received 
 requests for 61persons outside of Enron to host an eSpeak event.  We thought 
 you might like to know who your colleagues find interesting, so we've 
 provided a sampling of the suggestions below.  Here are the top ten most 
 requested eSpeakers.
 
 10.  Jack Welch, CEO, General Motors 
 9.  Scott McNeally, CEO, Sun Microsystems 
 8.  Satisfied Enron Customers
 7.  Stephen Covey, author, The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People
 6.  Oprah Winfrey, talkshow host
 5.  General Colin Powell, former Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, U.S.A. 
 4.  Alan Greenspan, Chairman, Federal Reserve, U.S.A.
 3.  Former U.S. President George Bush 
 2.  Bill Gates, CEO, Microsoft 
 1.  Texas Governor George W. Bush
 
 While we can't make any promises, we will do our best to bring in at least 
 some of these special guests.  If you have any contacts who could help us get 

 Everybody needs a little help now and then, even eSpeak.
 
 There were plenty of internal speakers requested, as well.  Those requests 
 should be somewhat easier to meet, although scheduling time with some of our 
 colleagues can be quite a task!
 
 Thank you all for your participation.
