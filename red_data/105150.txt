 
 I know that you were in the Rio office during the latter part of last week.  
 I sent you an e-mail last week to see how you were doing with the 
 research/memo.  I also called Marcelo Rodrigues and left a message.  I have 
 not heard from either you or Marcelo and I am anxious to continue our 
 dialogue.  Please e-mail or call at your earliest convenience.  Thanks.  Sara
