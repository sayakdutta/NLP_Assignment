  Let's try to get this signed as soon as possible.  The changes are as we 
 discussed.  I will be out Monday, but will be able to approve the final 
 version on Tuesday.

 Dan,
 
 Attached redline contract compares changes we discussed today to the
 document I sent you yesterday.  If changes are acceptable, I will send the
 contract to WPS for their review.
 
 Thanks!
 Kim
