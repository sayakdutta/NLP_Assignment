 I've had a couple of originators approach me about working on asset 
 management type deals, optimizing third parties' power assets and/or 
 purchase/sale of commodities.  A little birdie told me that you worked on 
 something somewhat similiar to that a while back, but the deal didn't go.  
 When you have a minute I would appreciate hearing about what you did.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
