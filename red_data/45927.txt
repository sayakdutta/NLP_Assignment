 Thanks.
 
 Do we still have the materials from the workshop that could be forwarded to 
 Jane?

 Unfortunately Euromoney is no longer offering their courses.  They were by 
 far the best around and it's a real shame.  There is a PLI course being 
 offered in NY in mid November (at which I'm speaking on commodity 
 derivatives) and ISDA has a conference in London on collateral arrangements 
 and the ISDA Credit Support Documents.  Neither is anywhere near as good as 
 the old Euromoney courses but both would probably benefit Jane.

 Are either of you aware of any master documentation workshops being offered 
 in NYC or London in the next few months that would be worthwhile for Jane 
 McBride to attend?  I remember several years ago going to a program that 
 Euromoney (or Eurocurrency) put on for 2-days focusing on ISDA's. 
 
 Please advise. Thanks.
