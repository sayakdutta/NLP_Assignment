 them along as soon as it happens).  The Full Moon party we discussed before 
 is on Nov. 23.  Unfortunately it is in the BVI.  If your lawyer can get the 
 permit by Monday and Fed Ex it to us, we could still get over there (Bomba's 
 Shack is on the western end of Tortola - reasonably close to the USVI).  The 
 boat will have a cell phone but we won't have a number till Sunday at the 
 earliest.  Be sure to bring the lawyer's number so we can call him Monday.

 P.S.  -  My sympathies on your day at Federal Plaza.  My imagination isn't up 
 to the task of conjuring how miserable that must have been.
