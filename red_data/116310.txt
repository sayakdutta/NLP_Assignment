 you had a good experience. I just think he's the nicest guy, so I bombard him 
 with people needing haircuts constantly. You know when I first went to him it 
 was because I couldn't get in to see my regular lady and he was the only 
 stylist who wasn't booked - now he never has a spare second! It makes me feel 
 like a proud mother. Thanks for letting me know.

 Brett is awesome!
 I got my haircut yesterday and I LOVE it.
 Thanks so much for the recommendation!
