Tracy & I are also meeting with Dan & John on Thursday to try to "diagram" some of the accounting process with imbalances, linepack & fuel (LOOK OUT!).  When we get the explanation organized, we will be presenting it to all y'all =)
 
 I hope you had a nice weekend in San Antonio.  I know the weather was wonderful.  Hope Hershal is doing better.
 
 Take Care,
 Lindy
 
 
     
 
 Lindy, I just saw this.  Did you know about this meeting?  I hope you were able to attend.  Thanks, Kim.

 After the TW Marketing meeting in EB #1336 today please stay to discuss Ken Powers daily TW system reports.  We want to work on improving the daily imbalance reporting.
