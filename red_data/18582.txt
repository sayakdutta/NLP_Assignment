 
 Duly noted.  I'll send you the latest.  I'll include you from this point on 
 in the distribution list.  If it gets to be too much in your in-box, just let 
 me know and I'll try to pare it back.  Here's the bottom line.  Folks have 
 asked me to coordinate California to some degree and there'll be an 
 expectation that we're well coordinated.  Again, this is not at all about 
 making your life more difficult, just a case of being well-informed.  And my 
 apologies for not having included you on the email distribution list sooner.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Jeff,
 I'd be happy to copy you on what I'm filing regarding QF energy pricing. I'd 
 appreciate the same courtesy. I have no idea what Ken Lay is advocating in 
 California becuase no one has ever sent me any information. I know he has 
 been in California because of the conference calls, but don't know his 
 message.
 Hap
