 
 Darla, 
 
 As far as I can tell, Craig's requests are ok.  Also, the NSP and gelber invoices you sent me look ok.  I am attaching my manual spreadsheet for the deals I have done from August forward.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Remember to use this spreadsheet in conjunction with what is in the system.
 
 Mara,
 
 I am just sending you this spreadsheet.  This has nothing to do with the Griffith deal.  We can discuss later.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kim
