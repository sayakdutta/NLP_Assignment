 execute ISDA Master Agreements with the SAME counterparties which already 
 have agreements with ENA (and vice versa).  As an example, I can only rely 
 upon tax advice ENA has previously received in connection with the services 
 agreement between ENA and ECT Canada.  For book and tax purposes, the trade 
 is recorded on the risk books of the Enron affilate ultimately booking the 
 trade but the transaction is actually documented in the name of the Enron 
 affiliate having the Master Agreement with the counterpary.  The Enron 
 affiliate having the Master Agreement with the counterparty then transacts 
 with Risk Management & Trading Corp. (through a bulk swap arrangement).  The 
 credit risk remains with Risk Management & Trading Corp. (through an internal 
 back to back transaction with the "booking" Enron affiliate)  for which the 
 "booking" Enron affiliate will presumably pay a fee pursuant to the services 
 agreement.
 
 Consider:  ENA is negotiating an agreement with Commonwealth Bank of 
 Australia.  Will Enron Australia require a separate master with Commonwealth 
 Bank of Australia?  Or will the services agreement permit the hereinabove 
 described arrangement?
