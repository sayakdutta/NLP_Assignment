 
 Hi Ben,
 
 Just wanted you to know that I received your email, and will follow through 
 on the change order.  I should be in the office on Thursday am, if not 
 sooner. As you can see, I'm picking up email, and can also be reached on my 
 cell phone.
 
 I reviewed your email re: VEPCO. We do have a project entity to use, and 
 Accounting (and Global Finace) have been involved on the MTM and off  balance 
 sheet issues.  I suspect we will find out about the need for a guarantee 
 soon.   
 
 It was good to get your input on VEPCO. There's lots to do on that one.

 Kay and Kathy:
 
 Please make the effective date of the change order the date of execution. I 
 have separately followed up on Lisa's DASH question, and we should be in a 
 position to execute the change order after this is clarified.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Ben

 Here are my comments after reviewing the below change order: (i) the cover 
 page refers to an enron 2-99 deal which does not correspond to the cover page 
 of the executed turbine purchase contract with GE.  To what does this refer 
 if a different deal and if the same deal, please conform.  (ii) the effective 
 date is stated as March 6, 2000.  Given that the agreement between Enron and 
 WestLB and the purchase agreement between WestLB and GE weren't signed until 
 May 12, 2000, if any backdating is needed (I'd like to understand why it is 
 for new equipment orders), it can't be before May 12th.  With respect to the 
 effective date and the overall placement of the order, has this $4.65MM 
 acquisition been dashed?  The current effective dash only contemplated the 
 turbines, not any ancillary equipment.  I believe Chip Schneider is the RAC 
 contact for this transaction.
 
 Regards, Lisa

 Please review the attached change order. We would like to have your comments 
 back, if any, in the next couple of days so we can execute the contract by 
 Friday. Let me know if you have any questions.
 
 Thanks,
