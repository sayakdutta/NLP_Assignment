 
 I'm moving my cash payment to Reliant to Friday.  Phil is going to give me new market values for Tallahassee and Midland tomorrow morning. 
 
  
     
 Chris - if we are sending money on Thursday we need to get the wire request to Doug today.
 
  

  
 Melissa Garner verified receipt of the $17,000.00 wire last Friday.  Thanks Melissa.
 
 Our current cash balance with Reliant is $57,180.00 after purchasing gas for tomorrow.
 
 Thanks.
