 If you have any information on existing or planned assets or positions please let me know.  If you want to discuss, please feel free to call me at 3x7673.
 
 Thanks.

 I am trying to identify generation assets owned and/or controlled in ERCOT by Enron and its affiliates.  
 
 The information I have been provided is that Enron only has Ponderosa Pine Energy Partners LTD - 263 MW.  Is this correct?
   
 Do we have any long-term capacity over the DC Tie?  
 Do we have any construction in progress?  
 Any other positions (e.g., Capacity Auction) that may be considered by the PUCT in the merger?
 
 Is there anyone else I should talk with about this information?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Jim
