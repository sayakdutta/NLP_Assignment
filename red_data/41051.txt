 
 I am getting ready to announce that I am bringing Kevin Howard into EGS as Vice President of Finance and Transaction Support.    Thinking about the current organization, do think it appropriate to consider putting Ms Fischer in his organization?   The kind of things she is doing for you currently are similar to the kind of things we are going to have Kevin working with Corp on.   I will be putting into his organization the economic analytic talents and special projects people from the pipeline group as well as some others.    We will not be charging out these costs into the specific commercial units, but instead expect them to generate the ideas and value to pay for themselves.    His group will be providing services to all, but I am willing to carve out some priorities.
