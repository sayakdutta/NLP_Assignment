 starts looking better.  Poor kid had strep last week.
 
 Maybe he'll perk up by Thursday, but the doctor says it is a 10 day ordeal.   
 I bet you would just as soon not be exposed to it.

 How is Thursday night for a family dinner as we discussed.  Lastly, no news 
 from anyone today on my front.  I'll call Michelle on Wednesday if I don't 
 hear anything tomorrow.
