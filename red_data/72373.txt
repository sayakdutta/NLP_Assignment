 
 I didn't know there was one.
 
 
 
 

   
  
 
 I do not have the override letter for this.
 
 




  
 
 
 I attach the form of the AAB agreement from Fountain Valley. Peter, if
 you
 have the override agreement for that deal, can you e-mail to thsi
 circulation?
 
 Bart, the project managers would like to get this form to ABB, who is in
 our offices today. I have asked Matt Tezyk to call and check with you to
 make sure you are on board before they do so. Can you let us know?
 
 In the absence of the electronic form of the override agreement, I will
 get
 Renee Alfaro to scan the hard copy I do have of the Fountain Valley
 document and send it to this distriubution.
