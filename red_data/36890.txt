 The file was too big to email.  It contains all financial deals (P,B,I,GD) in the active NG-PRICE book.  It does not contain any option deals.  I will set up the new books so that we can move the net positive deals by counterparty.  Let me know if you have any questions.  It is saved in O:/_Dropbox.
