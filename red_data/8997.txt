 
 It is good to be getting feedback on these standards.  After you have 
 received all responses, I will be curious as to the number and nature of 
 changes suggested.  I think for this to be powerful, we will need to expect 
 all commodities and all locations to meet common standards.  I will reserve 
 judgement on that however, pending your assessment once you have gotten all 
 responses.

 We have reviewed the proposed Global Standards and would like to propose two 
 changes for the Calgary office:
 
  Function:    Deal Confirmation
  Standard:  Brokered deals confirmed within 24 hours (versus the proposed 
 same day)
 
  Function:    Deal Confirmation
  Standard:  Deliver confirmation within 48 hours (versus the proposed 24 
 hours)
 
 In order for us to meet the originally proposed standards, we would either 
 require additional staffing or a reduction of the review process for our 
 transactions.
 Let me know if you have any questions or require additional clarification.  I 
 can be reached at ext. 6753.

 As I discussed in the staff meeting, I am sending you the global standards 
 for your review and comment.  Please review these standards to determine if:
 
 The targets set are reasonable for your business and
 As minimum standards, they are comprehensive enough (if you would like to see 
 additional reporting)
 
 Lastly, in the upcoming month we will start to implement exception reporting 
 for these standards.  Please let us know who the key contact in your 
 department would be for this implementation.
 
 Please address all correspondence to Michael Moscoso.
 
 Thank you,
 
 Shona
