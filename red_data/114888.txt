 
 I would be very interested in finding out more about the Deal Control 
 position and what it entails. Coming from a background in print journalism 
 leaves me somewhat at a loss for practical experience; however, I make up for 
 skills in my ability to learn quickly and work aggresively. I'll come by 
 sometime today to talk further about this opportunity. Thanks for the notice.
