 
 Unfortunately I am not going to be able to accept your generous offer to 
 attend the Indy 500.  My wife and I have 1 year-old twins and I was hoping to 
 get our Nanny to pull some week-end duty to help my wife with them as I went 
 to the races.  Unfortunately I was not successful in doing that.  Leaving her 
 to look after two infants while I attend the races didn't seem right.  Thanks 
 for the invitation!
 
 
    
  
 Stan,
 Monday is fine.  We hope it works out, we would love to have you as our
 guest.
 
 Cheers,
 Jim
