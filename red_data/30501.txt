 
 I have a meeting with Stan on Dec. 13.  I will see if I can schedule for the following week.
 
  
     
 Rod and Tracy-
 
 We are trying to plan for the 4th current estimate, and are looking at when our monthly reports roll in (around the 15th of December).  Can you give me guidance as to when we are due to give you our 4CE??  Hopefully, after the 15th will work.
 
 Michael
