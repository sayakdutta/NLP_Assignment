 
 Began initial field confirmation of EOTT crude oil tanks and equipment in the 
 MIdland Region.  Five of the thirteen teams which have EOTT facilites have 
 been inpsected and appropriate changes made to the database and spreadsheet.
 
 A meeting was held with the Midland field teams which have Title V 
 facilities, to complete and submit the required annual certifications.  All 
 Title V locations in the MIdland region were in compliance for this year.
 
 Region IX EPA has made a determination that prior to issuance of the air 
 permits for the Redrock turbine installation, Transwestern is to conduct an 
 endangered species survey of C/S's 3 and 4.  A contractor has been contacted 
 and the surveys will be completed prior to September 15th.   This is not a 
 new issue, as EPA Region VI, Dallas required consideration of the Endangered 
 Species Act to be completed at the Luguna C/S, which is on Laguna Indian 
 Lands.  The Title V permit will not be issued for the Laguna C/S until the 
 EPA is satisified that endangered species are not a concern.  
 
 Preliminary environmental and right of way field data are being provided to 
 an environmental contractor to initiate a fatal flaw analysis of a proposed 
 project for Transwestern Pipeline Company.
 
 Continued EOTT crude oil release data collections for forthcoming Sept. 27th 
 NFL meeting in MIdland.
