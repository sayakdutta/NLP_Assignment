 Will you be sending the ISDA Agreement for signature directly to Mark 
 Frevert?  I'm asking because he will have to sign the incumbency certificate 
 before Kate Cole, obviously, certifies to his signature.  How do you plan on 
 doing this?  Perhaps we should have Edmund Cooper in London coordinate the 
 signing.  What are your thoughts?
