 
 Bryan,
 
 I talked to Vasant about the model review in London. He thought that he could 
 accomplish this from Houston,
 but I think direct  communication makes things much easier. I think his trip 
 to London
 makes a lot of sense. KMV confirmed the meeting on the 20th. We hope to get 
 more information about
 the scope of their model and assess its the applicability to your business.
 Vasant, after a few days of immersion in your operations, will be able to 
 assess better the usefulness of the
 model.

 vince - it is highly unlikely that I can make the trip but I spoke with 
 vasant today and he will try to get to london beforehand and will have good 
 idea of our needs.  hopefully this will not cause too many problems.
