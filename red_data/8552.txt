 Sally, this may not be in your area at all, but I am passing on to you, if applicable and any interest.  Thanks.

 Hello Kenneth,
 
 I am writing this short note in an effort to further my understanding of
 Enron and establish some rapport with you regarding your ideas on voice and
 video conferencing.
 Polycom Network Systems manufactures the Accord infrastructure that allows
 you to have multiple participants in video and voice conferences
 simultaneously.  Fundamentally, I am interested to hear your ideas on voice
 and video conferencing and perhaps have a discussion on how your
 requirements (if they exist at all) may be addressed by Polycom Network
 Systems in a dually beneficial business relationship.
 
 I have attached two short introductions to the Accord Product Line to
 eliminate the anonymity of this correspondence.  The Multi Network
 Communication attachment furthers your knowledge about video conferencing.
 The V2GC-20 attachment discusses the many features that the Accord Product
 Line has to offer.
 
 All the best to you,
 
 Jenny Moore
