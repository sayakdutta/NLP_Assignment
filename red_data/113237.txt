 You both probably already know this, but just to reiterate from my notes.  We need to be in the position to produce the following for FERC:

 Paper trail that explains the assignment from EES to EPMI (if that is indeed true)
 Identify who will prepare the affidavit and give testimony if needed
 
 Jim, we talked about the first one but not the next two.
