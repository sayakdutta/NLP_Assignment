 Sally,
 
 I don't know if you received this the first time, as I received out of office auto reply.  Can you provide me with any assistance?

 Sally,
 
 In March of 1999, ETS companies, Northern Natural Gas (NNG) and Transwestern Pipeline Company (TW), signed Confidentiality Agreements with Enron Capital and Trade (ECT) for pricing information.  You were the signatory for ECT at that time.  These price curves are used by the pipelines for risk management purposes.  Currently, we are implementing a new risk system and would like the ability to use this system across all of ETS' pipes.  However, the Confidentiality Agreements do not permit us to share this information with any other companies.  I would appreciate any assistance you could provide in identifying the new person at ENA/EWS that would handle these duties currently.
 
 Thanks
