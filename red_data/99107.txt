 Richard:
  
 This  is the e-mail message that I mentioned to you yesterday.  Thanks for your  help.  Take care.

     T.O.,  Jennifer, Josh, and Lang:
  
 Richard Sanders of Enron called me  yesterday morning.  He said that Enron is  selling the Arlington "plant" even before construction begins.  In other  words, Enron is selling the land, the permit applications, some turbines and  other equipment, and the technology for building the plant.  Richard said  that he would try to confirm this information by speaking to the in-house Enron  attorney who is handling this project.  This is probably confidential  information, so I suggest that you not disclose it outside the firm.  I  will attempt to obtain the name of the buyer so as to determine whether we may  be in a position to provide services to that entity.   Thanks.

     Peter,  as a follow up to Josh's email, it would be good for you to know I will be  having lunch this Wednesday with David Harbin.  David literally wrote the  current "suspension" of new power development sources for the governor (also  known as the "moratorium").  More importantly, he will be writing the  governor's response at the completion of findings to presented by the  Interagency Energy Policy Work Group as well as directly advising  Sundquist during the findings process.  David is an attorney "on loan"  to TDEC from the EPA.  David's close to our Firm and has offered to  listen to our suggestions.   BDBC has the services of two  partners, Bob Steele and Jim Vines, versed in setting up both  base--load or peeking plants.  We can't afford to miss this opportunity as  a Firm or fail to alert our client to our "unique expertise."  How's that  for a sales job!  Thanks for your support.  Jenny

  Peter, I understand  you spoke with my dad earlier today about the possibilities of providing some  public policy representation for Enron.  Jenny Ford and I have already  begun attending meetings of the Interagency Energy Policy Work Group and  receive updates on their itinerary.  As my dad told you, this group will  have great influence over the future of the power plant moratorium in the  state.  I have several documents that explain the work group, it's  mission, and it's members that I will forward if you like.  Please feel  free to contact me with any questions or comments.  We are looking  forward to the opportunity to work with Enron.
  
 Josh
