 
 The attached document contains the EPMI average prices for all delivery 
 points for Sun., March 25, and Mon., March 26. Please let me know if you have 
 any problems opening the document or reading it. The worksheet should look 
 identical to the fax I send each day. An additional worksheet shows a detail 
 of each deal volume and price. I'm in the habit of excluding the counterparty 
 names (to save time) because I'm the only one who looks at this sheet 
 normally; but if you'd like me to start e-mailing instead of faxing the 
 prices I will begin entering the counterparty names as well.
 
 
 
 Thanks,
