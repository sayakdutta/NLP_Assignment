 Tana,
 
 These are the groups that we have available for the cities that you mentioned:
 
  All Enron Houston
  Everyone_in_ECT_Calgary
  Everyone_in_ECT_London
  Everyone_in_ECT_Portland
  Everyone_in_ECT_New York
  Everyone_in_ECT_Denver
  Everyone_in_ECT_Oslo
  Everyone_in_ECT_Singapore
  Singapore EI Announcements
  EI-Australia
  Buenos Aires Argentina - Office Staff
  Buenos Aires Argentina - TGS Office Staff
  Enron Everyone_EOG_Denver
  Enron Everyone_EOG_Calgary
 
 If this will do, let me know and I'll use these groups.  If you need 
 something else , please contact Linda Lannom in HR to provide you with a list 
 of all Enron employees by city.  Again, if you do this I will need them in an 
 Excel spreadsheet with First Name, Last name, Social Security number and 
 department.
 
 I will send you a draft of the letter in a few minutes.  I will need you to 
 send approval to Enron Messaging Administration in order to send it out.
 
 Thanks 
 
 Erika
 
 
 
    
  
 Please direct this email to all employees at the offices indicated below (I 
 think Sydney is our Australia office).  I have revised the letter a little 
 and am reattaching  it.  Thanks!

 It is the "and any other offices where we might have trading affiliates" 
 portion of your message that still has me concerned.  I can send the message 
 to all ENA and, if we don't have one already, have HR provide a list of 
 employees in the other cities you listed.  However, I don't know the answer 
 to the any other offices.  Do you want to send it to every employee 
 worldwide?  
 
 Sorry to be difficult but I still don't have a good idea of your desired 
 audience.

 I do not have an individual list.  It will have to got to all the employees 
 in the cities, and or countries where we have trading offices, which is 
 pretty much the list I had below.

 Tana,
 
 We have a recent group with all of ENA.  However, we do not have anything set 
 up for trading affiliate offices or a way to determine that information.  
 Please provide any names/addresses that are needed other than the ENA.
 
 If you do give me names that are not already in a Notes address format, I 
 will need you to provide them in an Excel spreadsheet with First Name, Last 
 name, Social Security number and department to help resolve conflicts.
 
 Please contact me if you have any questions.

 I need to send out the attached memo ASAP to all employees of Enron North 
 America and its trading affiliate offices.  This includes Houston, Calgary, 
 London, Denver, New York, Oslo, Singapore, Portland, Australia, Buenos Aires, 
 and any other offices where we might have trading affiliates.  Can someone 
 with your team get back to me ASAP so we can be clear about who we send this 
 to.  Thanks!
