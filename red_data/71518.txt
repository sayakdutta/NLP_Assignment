 agreement is us suing them for specific performance, ie, making them sell us 
 the land.  Since we shouldn't have any obligations under an option agreement, 
 I don't worry about arbitration.  Let me think about it, though.
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
   
  
 For some reason we did deleted the Arbritration Paragraph in the 
 Electrocities Option Agreement.  Shouldn't I add it to this new Option (seems 
 kind of important).
