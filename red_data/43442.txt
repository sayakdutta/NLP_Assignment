 Good morning, Stan.  I would just like to extend my appreciation to you again 
 for allowing me to join you on the visit to the Wiggly Compression Station 
 Friday.  
 The main factors influencing my choice to join Enron were the laid back 
 culture and the treatment of the employees.  Thus, it was wonderful to see 
 the interaction between the Executive and Operational team.  
 
 Sincerely,
 Monica Hwang
