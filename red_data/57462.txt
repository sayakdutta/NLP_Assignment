 was evolving over the course of last week.  As you pointed out, the Japanes=

 To date, reports on Enron's role in California have been limited to a repri=
 nt=20
 of a Sacramento Bee article appearing in the Denki Shimbun - a limited=20
 circulation publication sponsored by the Japanese utilities. Last Friday Mr=
 =20
 Ohta, President of Chubu Electric and Chairman of the Federation of Electri=
 c=20
 Power Companies, made some uninformed comments at a regular energy press cl=
 ub=20
 briefing about Enron's commitment to its Californian customers . Ohta will =
 be=20
 retiring from both positions in two weeks.=20
 
 In the past both Chubu Electric and the Federation of Electric Power=20
 Companies have distanced themselves from Mr Ohta's public comments which ar=
 e=20
 generally considered to be ultra conservative and unsupported by facts. As =
 a=20
 result, we have tended to ignore his comments. However, on this occasion I=
 =20
 think we need to set the record straight on Enron's role in California. I=
 =20
 would welcome your thoughts on whether we should let the comments pass or=
 =20
 respond.
 
 Over the past few months we have received various statements from Houston=
 =20
 (for both internal and external consumption) explaining Enron's role in=20
 California. Most recently (May 10) we received from Peggy Mahoney (via Vanc=
 e)=20
 an EES statement dated 1 February entitled "Media Statement about EES=20
 Resourcing California Customers". It would be helpful if there is a=20
 comprehensive statement that has recently been put together that we could=
 =20
 distribute here. If not, we can put something together here tomorrow and=20
 email it across to you for approval, with the aim of getting something out=
 =20
 Wednesday.
 
 As an aside, we had a record 3,766 visitors to the EJ website last Friday,=
 =20
 the day the Brattle paper appeared on the website.
