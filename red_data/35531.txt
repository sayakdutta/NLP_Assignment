 
 Don't make any changes for now.  I need to draft a more detailed memo.
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
    
 Chris,
 
  On deal #348443 with Clinton Energy, Clinton is showing a volume of 12,800 
 dth instead of 12,803 (what we are showing).  Diane Morris at Clinton got 
 with her scheduler and he verified that they only received 12,800 dth.  Could 
 you please verify our amount and change if necessary?  Let me know what you 
 find.  Thanks...
