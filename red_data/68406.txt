 Jeff was able to create a Netco file under O:\erms\erms_adm without an erequest.  There is a file for each region out there now.  I will save the new p&l to each region but could each of you please pick an p&l from your region as a back-up just in case. 
 
 these are the files I know of
 
 Exotica
 P&L
 Hedgestrips
 All excel queries
 Weapon-X & new version
 Access financial reports
 Exotics file
 Transport model
 Curve files
 
 
 Do you guys have anything else?
