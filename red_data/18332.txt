 My apologies, but Steve's going to be in a meeting with the Governor from 
 about 1:30 to 3 PM today and then is likely on a plane directly thereafter 
 returning to Houston.  Likely best to try to arrange the call for tomorrow, 
 if that works with Laura.  I'll check Steve's schedule and forward the 
 information to you.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
