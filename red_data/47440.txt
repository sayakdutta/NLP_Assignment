 
 I am OK with what Credit say, which is if the counterparties are already 
 approved for trading those pulp & lumber products theyan trade the new 
 products, except for the following counterparties which we need to be careful 
 about becuase they could only tansact newsprint:
 
 The Bakersfield Californian:  can transact only newsprint
 E.W. Scripps Company (The) can only transact 48.8 gram newsprint swaps
