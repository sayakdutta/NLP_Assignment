 those macadamias in interoffice mail, would you?

 you are dead...I have already dug into the nuts, and now I think you did it 
 on purpose so that I lose the bet!  
 
 
    
 I'm picking out the carpet this weekend--so I'll also run out and get a 
 picnic basket!  Your desert capabilities are impressive!  (Next time I'll get 
 a quart of whipped cream instead of a pint so you can have twice as much, and 
 I can win our contest)
 
 You are a lot of fun--I like hanging out with you.

 I had a great time too.  next time when the carpet is in, we can have a 
 little carpet picnic and watch the 8:00!  by the way...I am still full.  Have 
 you ever seen a girl put away so much dessert?  I am actually known for it!  
 Mark almost died the first time he saw me eat dessert!!!  I am only coming 
 for dinner again if you promise we can have homemade whipped cream.  I think 
 it is one of the only white things that I like to eat.
 
 
    
 You know, we've done something the last few tuesdays, and it is now my 
 favorite day of the week!  I had a great time.
