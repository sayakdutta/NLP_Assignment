 Thanks for the congratulations.  Yes, the title is an new one - announced just a few weeks ago.  
 
 I look forward to seeing you next Tuesday evening.  --Sally

 As I have in previous years, I look forward to joining you, your colleagues
 and mine at the reception and dinner.
 
 Subject to understandable space constraints, may I be so bold as to suggest
 you consider inviting my Center for Energy Finance Assistant Director
 Angela Dorsey, who has been closely involved with all UT energy finance
 activities?
 
 I take this opportunity to congratulate you on what I believe is, at least
 to me, your new title.
 
 Best Regards,
 Ehud Ronn
