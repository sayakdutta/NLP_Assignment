 Tracy, I agree.  We just weren't there yet last week when we met with Danny.  
 
 Tracy and Steve, I want to substitute "Net Contribution Commercial" for the Net Margin on my combination schedule.  Do you have the other line items by Quarter that you can come to a Net Contribution Commercial number?
