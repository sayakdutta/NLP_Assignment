 Mark,
 We are currently getting prepared to trade ammonia and urea in Enron Global Markets.  We started the group within EGM - NGL's late July, and with the help of John Viverito, getting ourselves ready for the physical trade.  We would like to meet with you for a few minutes early next week, if possible, to discuss the financial contract, what we will need to get one prepared, etc.  Our goal is to be prepared to do both the physical and financial trading of fertilizer by the end of the year.
