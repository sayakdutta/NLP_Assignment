 Good Evening
 
 I ran a master download for December 1 so that over the next few days I can test the overwriting fix, and found two deals that are 24 hour deals, show scheduled hours of 1-24, but are segregated with the "OFF PEAK" deals. 
 
 The deal numbers are:
 
 576490.1	 
 737863.1	 
 
 
 Can you look and see if they are booked in a strange way that makes them fall into the wrong segregation category?
