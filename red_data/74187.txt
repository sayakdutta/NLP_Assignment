 Kay:
 
 I spoke with Karen Way this afternoon.  She received a call earlier today 
 from Mr. Ledford's (Pontiac site neighbour) attorney.  The attorney called to 
 say that he had met with the Ledford family this morning to review our 
 proposed Option Purchase Agreement on the Ledford property (home and land 
 adjacent to our Pontiac project site).  The result of this meeting was that 
 we "have a deal" subject to the following changes:
 
  1.  That the son and daughter-in-law be made parties to the Agreement (they 
 currently own/reside in the home and have indicated they are ready to sign)
  2.  That Titan LLC will pay the survey, title search and transfer fees as a 
 part of the closing costs of the property (approx $3-$5K)
 
 The Ledford family understands that we wish to execute this Agreement prior 
 to conducting our zoning meetings next Monday and Thursday evening.  
 
 Since these changes are relatively minor , I have instructed Karen to revise 
 the necessary pages of the Agreement and forward copies to the Ledford's 
 attorney for review (and hopefully execution).  Please call/email myself and 
 Karen with any comments.
 
 Thanks,
 Fred
