 Mike,
 
 This weekend, Cole, my thirteen year old, and I attended the birthday party 
 for Dorothy's five year old daughter, Caitland. What ever happended to the 
 saying " the more things change, the more they remain the same"?  Things have 
 definitely not stayed the same.
 
 Anyway, Dorothy asked about you and I encouraged her to call you, and I think 
 she will.
