 
 Energy Operations will enjoy participating in this program.  I would like to 
 bring this us up at my staff meeting on Monday, April 10, so I will get back 
 to you with the number of students and the contact person(s) next week.

 Cliff Baxter is representing Enron on the Board of Junior Achievement.  One 
 of the programs that he would like to continue at Enron is the Job Shadow 
 program.  This program entails a half-day commitment once per month beginning 
 with the fall school semester.  The high school students are first given an 
 overview of Enron and then a tour of the building.  The students then spend 
 approximately 1-1/2 hours directly with individuals within specific 
 departments.  Cliff would like to have as many departments as possible 
 participate since this may be the only exposure these students have to the 
 business world.
 
 Please advise if you are willing to have your department participate, who 
 your contact person is, and how many students that you would like to host 
 each time.
 
 Thank you for your consideration.
 
 Susan
