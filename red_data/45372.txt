 
 I'm helping Alan Aronowitz out with a presentation he has to give on the 
 global energy markets and I was thinking that Paul recently did a 
 presentation and maybe there might be some good slides on the European 
 markets that I can pull in.  Can you locate, or find someone to locate, 
 Paul's presentation, and email it to me.
 
 I hope you get out of work at a decent hour today.  I bet you could use a 
 beer with all the late nights you've been putting in.  How's the house going?
 
 Thanks for your help!
