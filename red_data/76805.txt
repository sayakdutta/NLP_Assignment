 My adds to you list are (1) the "2-Train" contract for Pastoria (7FAs, HRSGs 
 & other ancillary equipment) and (2) the "1-Train" contract for Pastoria 
 (agreement in principle with final, full-blown contract nearing completion).

 To all,
 
 As you know, Enron is refinancing the equipment we bought through WestLB.  
 I've been asked to compile a list of all the equipment purchased through 
 WestLB, and the change orders related to same.  All I know about is the LM 
 deal with GE (with 1 executed change order, approximately 4 or 5 pending) and 
 the ABB transformer deal (with one CO pending).  Please let me know if you 
 are aware of any others.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
