  What are you doing on Labor Day? 
  
 In between the hamburgers, hotdogs, homemade ice cream and occasional dip in 
 the pool that many of you will undoubtedly be enjoying Monday, be sure to 
 take a few minutes to turn your TV set to the Jerry Lewis Labor Day Muscular 
 Dystrophy (MDA) Telethon on NBC.  At 1:10 p.m., Enron's own Linda Jenkins 
 will present a $100,000 check to Jerry's Houston team.  The donation, which 
 will benefit research for ALS (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as 
 Lou Gehrig's disease -- the disease Linda has been living with for the past 
 three years), was raised by devoted friends and volunteers at the Enron/MDA 
 Beach Bowl held in July.  
 
 Thanks to all of you who raised money for this cause that is close to our 
 hearts at Enron.   And have a happy and safe holiday.
