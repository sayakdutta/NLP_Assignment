 Hi Mr. Shankman,
 
 I am a second year finance major at Wharton.  I left a voice mail for you
 the other day in which I mentioned my interest in pursuing finance
 opportunities in Japan.  I have extensive experience in Japan and am looking
 to go back and take advantage of some of the fascinating changes that are
 occurring over there.  I will try calling you again this Thursday to
 hopefully discuss Enron's strategies and opportunities more specifically.  I
 have attached my resume for your consideration.  I look forward to talking
 to you.
 
 Sincerely yours,
 
 Christopher Handte
