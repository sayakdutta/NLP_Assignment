 
 Enclosed is a revised draft of the policy without any modifications on the 
 exclusions as this is an area that ACE is apparently continuing to develop.  
 As I mentioned yesterday, we will talk with you about this on Monday at 
 1(Houston time).  Our commercial team would then like to have a call with ACE 
 sometime after our call to talk about exclusions, subrogation rights and 
 matters relating to books and records that are addressed in the policy.  I 
 don't think that all of you need to be on this call but was wondering if any 
 of you would be available for this call.  Please let me know.

 here is a redlined version from the previous draft.  i'm giving you this to
 highlight what changed, but you may want to just "Accept all changes" to
 have a fresh copy to look at.  this still has some things to work on, so let
 your counsel know that.  let me know when we can meet monday or tuesday.
