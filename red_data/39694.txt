 Hi Mark, 
 
 I'm still waiting to hear back from the President of Western Union. I met 
 with the company psychologist last Wednesday and she said that she thought I 
 would be offered a position within a few days. The long wait game wears on 
 you after a while. 
 
 We were talking about coming up to Breckinridge to ski with you one day, 
 perhaps Christmas. What day do you arrive and when do you leave. 
 
 Have a great day. 
 
 Larry
