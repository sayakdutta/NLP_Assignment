 I would like to discuss seminars in Europe to further promote the isda form 
 among energy companies on the continent.  Please give me a ring at your 
 convenience.

 Mark,
 
 Enron Europe's experience is that there is some resistance to ISDA 
 documentation in most of the European countries in which we are active. Our 
 list of countries which we feel would benefit from promotional sessions 
 arranged by ISDA is as follows. The countries are in order ranked by Enron 
 Europe's view of the significance of the market in each country and where 
 ISDA resistance is strongest. Most significant market and most resistance 
 ranked at the top of the list for both Europe and the Far East: 
 
 Europe
 Germany
 Switzerland
 Austria
 Spain
 Nordic countries: Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland
 Netherlands
 Italy
 France
 Poland
 Czech Republic
 Hungary
 
 Far East
 Singapore
 Japan
 Hong Kong
 
 
 Thanks
 
 
 
      Mark
