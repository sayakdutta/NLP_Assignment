 I'm going to get on Ken Lay's schedule in the next couple of days(assuming he'll let me).  I'll ask him his advice about our deregulation strategy in general and talk to him about his visit.  I'm concerned that hoards of people from Houston will show up and that it will be a cluster.  Can you send me an email with some key facts about our deals - p/l impact of opening and the market in genereal.  Also the history of dereg and the dates they have missed and why for my Ken meeting.  Write it in bullet point format and quite summarized.
