 
 I am working on the presentation for the analyst meetings that are taking 
 place July 24-26.  Enron Net Works is being featured and as part of the 
 overall story Skilling wants to see some basic information on your businesses 
 (and a few other possible verticals and market places).  Please provide me 
 with these 3 specific items of information.
 
 1.  Total market size for your business:  e.g.  Pulp and Paper is approx. 
 $300 billion.
 2.  Your target market share of that total
 3.  Targeted (or other comparable) margin that you would (or could) expect to 
 see
 
 I realize this is subjective but I do need an answer to all 3 questions.  Put 
 any explanation that you feel is important or needed.  Also please quote the 
 source of the global market size.  When I get all the information, I'll go 
 through it with everyone.
 
 We  also need to get the global size of the markets that we are considering 
 moving into and if you know any of these below, please let me know.
 
 Data storage
 Grains
 Petrochemicals
 Steel
 Logistics
 
 Thank you for your quick response.
