 
 The quote speaks to so many in such personal ways...Obviously you identified 
 with it's message.  Although, I'm not sure about the Dalai Lama comment as he 
 does believe in a power higher than himself.
 
 As for myself...
 
 I am still measuring my powers.  They seem to lie in such varied arenas that 
 I never know what I will discover day-to-day.
 
 As far as tasting the fruits of my passion, you know what they say...the 
 first bite is the sweetest.  And I must say I look forward with great 
 anticipation to sitting down at the table when the time is right.
 
 My place in the world is a combination of one of the guys and the ever 
 idealistic, eternal optimist (i.e. I see what is and yet still hold out hope 
 for more).
  * I don't believe the sentiment in Return to Me was pure fiction.
 
 Given all of this I am very happy.

 have defenetly tasted the fruits of my passion (an desires) ask my ercent ex 
 (shannon) or all the ex that still call me for sex....and my place in the 
 world..wel nothing short then the next dalai Lama..
 I'm pretty happy i must say

 To be happy you must have taken the measure of your powers; tasted the fruits 
 of your passion and learned your place in the world.
