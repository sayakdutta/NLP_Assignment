 Jeff - you should receive in the next day or so a Security Agreement from our 
 lawyers in Bermuda (Appleby Spurling) which has to be executed on behalf of 
 ENA.  I have approved these docs - in short the agreement grants us security 
 in a Reinsurance Contract which supports RVI's obligation under the Credit 
 Default Swap.
 
 I would be grateful if you could sign where necessary and forward all copies 
 by courier directly to Sharon White at the following address:
 
 Sharon White
 Conyers Dill & Perman
 Clarendon House
 PO Box HM 666
 Hamilton 
 Bermuda
 
 Sara - I would be grateful if you could provide the requisite legal 
 initials.  On a separate point - Sara - can you confirm that Greg Whalley has 
 the authority to sign on behalf of ENA - if so can you have someone fax me a 
 copy of the signatory authority.
  
 If you have any questions give me buzz.
 
 Many tks
 
 Denis
 
 
 PS - Drop me a mail when the docs have gone so I can chase-up with Sharon.
