 Tanya,
             The exponentials we tried earlier (a+bexp(-cx), etc, fit well b=
 ut=20
 gave negative numbers in the bootstrapping.
             I tried a + b(t+c)(-1) , a standard power law, and as the ?acco=
 mpanying graph shows (for the 12 months), the fits are quite good.?        =
     In this case, the ffvols do not become negative (I believe this ?corres=
 ponds to your 0 beta).  ?  I would have preferred exp(-t) and variants (can=
  explain owing to ?mean-reverting vols), but the power law might be a pract=
 ical alternative ?(from an implementation standpoint).?Naveen??? ????Tanya =

 iscussions I implemented one method for creating forward ?forward curve?fro=
 m implied vol curve. ?I sorted out 12 forward curves from an original forwa=
 rd vol curve, each of 12 ?curves corresponding?to certain month. Then I fit=
 ted each of 12 curves with a function:??y=3Da+A/power(x+b, beta)??I figured=
  out that when beta is from (0, .5) the above function is suitable ?for per=
 forming our bootstrapping?routine of deriving ff vols from implied, because=
 :??y(x+t) * y(x+t) * (x+t) - y(x) * y(x) * tx> 0                  for all x=
 , t.??(I have to double check on this again. Also when beta>0.5 there are s=
 ome ?combinations of parameters a, A, b, beta?for which above equality hold=
 s). Even with restriction on beta this class of ?functions represents quite=
  a variety of shapes.??Below you see the example of fitting as well as the =
 example of ff vol curve ?constructed from implied vol curve for NG.??I'll t=
 ry this for power as well.??Any comments??????????????
