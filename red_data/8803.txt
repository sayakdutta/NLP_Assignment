 
 Thanks for looking into this and getting back to me.  Let me know the final 
 resolution on this one.

 We have figured out why the credit group is getting so many "New 
 Counterparty" names in gas.  The spreadsheets that they are getting that 
 information from are for position purposes only on pipe-optons.  The value is 
 captured in TAGG and therefore if both had the correct counterparty it would 
 be doublecounting credit risk.  The spreadsheet download has a specific 
 download that it has to follow which includes counterparty name  (which in 
 this case had to be put in as new counterparty.)  I am working with Debbie to 
 figure out how we can download those positions without showing a counterparty 
 at all from the spreadsheet.  It will be done as quickly as possible.
 
 Thanks
