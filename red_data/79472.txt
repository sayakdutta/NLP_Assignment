 Gentlemen,
 
 Per your request, attached are two slides detailing our Reliable Reserves 
 product and our Term Working Interest structure.  Each slide contains a few 
 bullet points describing the structure as well as a real transaction analysis 
 of each and the corresponding results.  Please give me a call if you have any 
 questions.
