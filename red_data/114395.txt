 
 The unit on this deal is Las Vegas Cogeneration - and I asked Les to start 
 entering the specific unit in the comments section of unit-contingent deals. 
 Let me know if he does or does not.....
 
 Thanks,
 Kate
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
   
  
 This is a unit contingent deal.  We have been told that we have to have the 
 unit name to include in the confirmation when we confirm these deals.  Can 
 you have the traders add the unit name in the comment section whe they do 
 unit contingent deals?
 
 Thanks!
