  This version is ready for you customer to execute.  Please have them print two originals, sign and return both to my attention.  Also,  the gty from NG to ENA should be signed.
 
  
 
 Thanks
 
  
     
 Debra,
 
 Will you change this back to $10,000,000 on Parental Garantee
 In other words back to the original except we want the term to stay the same.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Sylvia
