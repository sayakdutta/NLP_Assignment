 I would wait on sending the confirms because we are currently negotiating 
 with NUI on the provisions that Sara added.  NUI has told us that those 
 provisions are unacceptable in the physical deal so I assume they will be 
 unacceptable in the financial deal.  Hopefully, this issue will be resolved 
 tomorrow.  I will let you know the outcome.

 Mark, 
 
 Do you guys want to look at these confirms before they go
 out?  I've incorporated the language Sara provided.......
