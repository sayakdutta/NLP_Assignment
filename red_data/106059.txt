 The referenced agreement was sent  to you for execution on December 7, 2000.  
 We have never received an executed original of the agreement or the guaranty 
 from Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc.  We have called on several occasions to 
 locate these instruments.
 
 Please let us know if there is a problem.
