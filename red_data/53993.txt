 Stinson,
 
 Thanks a lot for so much work you have done for the simulation model.
 It seems that our work will make an impact on EOL trading, that is very
 exciting.
 
 Could you e-mail me the spreadsheet model so that I can catch up with
 the changes you have made ?   
 
 I read a few books during this vocation. Especially a stochastic processes
 book, I finished the entire book.  The queueing theory is very fascinating,
  and hopefully we can apply the theory to a real EBS project.
 
 I will take my family out to see the Nature Bridge Caverns near San Antonio
 tomorrow.
 
 See you on Tuesday. 
 
 Happy New Year !
 
 Zimin

 Greg,
 
 Here are results corrected for spread profit per round-trip transaction.   
 Prior results incorrectly counted a spread profit per trade.
