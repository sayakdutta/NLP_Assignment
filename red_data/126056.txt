 i think the YMCA has a class that is for people recovering from heart-attacks
 i remeber something about that
 
  
     
 
 i don't know about the heart classes.  i'll look into it, but her dr (ravi)
 isn't offering up any suggestions or anything.  she saw him before the
 surgery in august, and he said things were okay.  i really don't think he's
 too helpful.
 
 she is lazy -- but it really frustrates me that she doesn't want to help
 herself.  i told her that not walking is like not taking her heart
 medication.  that didn't seem to resonate.  dad is going to go to the YMCA
 tomorrow and maybe get a membership for both of them -- they have a walking
 track there (at least it's something to do in the winter).  when she was
 down this weekend, we walked around the craft show (at the Exhibition
 place) and she said that was a lot of exercise (2 hrs).  The only problem
 is that we were just strolling, and not really walking very fast.

 just send the essay at home
 
 I don't know what to do about mom, i don't think fear is the only thing
 holding her back , i think she is lazy
 
 is there a heart health class in Sudbury that has excercise regimines as
 well as diets?
 
 when is the last time she saw her doctor
 
     
                 
    Hi John
 
    How was Thanksgiving?  Was the baby shower fun?
 
    I was wondering if you'd have some time to read over Ali's Chicago
    essays
    later tonight?  He's going to submit them on Wednesday.  Let me know if
    that's okay.  Do you have a printer at home?  Can I send them to your
    home
    account?  (I don't think Ali will be done before about 8pm or so
    tonight).
 
    PS:  We need to talk about mom.  I saw her this weekend -- she's gained
    a
    lot of weight, and hasn't been exercising at all.  Dad's pretty
    frustrated
    because all she does is watch tv.  I had a talk with her yesterday
    telling
    her that she has more risk of having a heart attack if she doesn't walk
    /
    exercise than if she exerts herself when exercising (i think she's
    afraid
    of having a heart attack while exercising).  We need to do something --
    she's 170lbs now, and should be at around 140lbs to be healthy.
