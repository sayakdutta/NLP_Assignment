 "confidential" stamp on it, so even though I have access to Jeff's mailbox, 
 it won't allow me to open it.  Unfortunately, Jeff does not check his own 
 e-mail, and if I go into his machine, I won't be able to print it as it is 
 not connected to any printer.
 
 Thanks, John.  I'll see that Jeff gets it as soon as it's received.  SRS
