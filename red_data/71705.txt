 
 Hi there,
 
 I'm forwarding a draft EPC contract for your review.  This form of contract 
 assumes that the equipment will be procurred by the Owner, with the 
 understanding that we have not resolved the issue of the timing of the 
 procurement of the equipment, and  how it will be procurred.
 
 This is intended to be a discussion draft, and is subject to further Enron 
 review and comment.  
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
