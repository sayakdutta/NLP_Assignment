 This information on Ontario nukes is similar to our information. The only 
 difference is that our regulatory lawyer feels that only one of the four 
 Pickering units (500 mw each) would come back in 2001 (although optimistic) 
 followed by one each year after that.  Your report says that all Pickering 
 units would come back in 2001.  Even in your report, however, they seem 
 doubtful that this is realistic.  The Bruce Units (3000 mw) appear to be dead 
 for a long time if not for good.

 P.S.  I'll call you soon on are project, currently on hold until 2001 if we 
 decide to build in Ontario.
