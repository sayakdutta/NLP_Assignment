 Hey Greg,
 I enjoyed interviewing with both you and Jim last week
 friday. I would like to talk to you some more about
 the opportunities available in Enron Networks. Two
 areas I thought would be interesting would either be
 helping to structure a market for Enron Networks to
 enter, or help develop a market that Enron Networks is
 in the process of entering.
 
 A couple of things that I thought were interesting
 about your strategy for B2B is that unlike most
 business plans where the strategy is build the site
 and the volume will come, Enron uses it's own volume
 to entice other people to participate. What most
 e-commerce sites want to do is charge for the dating
 process, but in reality this has very little value
 added unless the market is coupled with a
 finance/clearinghouse function and a physical delivary
 system for physical goods. We addressed some of these
 issues in the ilogex business plan.
 
 I have attached a copy of the ilogex business plan to
 give you an idea of some of my thoughts on e-commerce.
  I look forward to talking to you tommorrow morning.
 
 Thanks,
 Brad
