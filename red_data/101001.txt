 you may be adhering to it too faithfully.  At this rate we may have to start 
 pinning notes to your shirt to remind you to do things.  However, having 
 driven with you on several occasions I feel confident you will be able to 
 pass the test with flying colors.  Keep in mind though that if you end up 
 failing I will not let you forget it (and, as we have established, I have the 
 memory of an elephant).  
 
 I'll keep discussion of me to a minimum and just say that things are well on 
 32.  Now back to what's really important...you.  Thought you'd like to know 
 that the Dixie Chicks are coming back to Houston Dec. 12 and will performing 
 just down the street from you at the Compaq Center...it's all about you and 
 your needs.

 AAAAAGGGHHHHHH...I just found out that I need to take the TX drivers exam 
 both written and on the rode.  This is a two day process and all because I 
 let my CA license expire.   I know I need some of your organizational 
 skills.  I may try to run out and take the test this afternoon while I get 
 moved to 30 (I better not fail it). How's life on 32 today -- well that's 
 enough about you let's talk more about me.
