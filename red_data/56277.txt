 Vince and Stinson,
 
 I checked the file and the maintenance that automatically renews on 4/1/2000  
 is for the following products:
 

 SPAV
 SWING
 
 I will go ahead and contact FEA and see about getting the renewal invoice for 
 these.  I'll send it to Shirley for payment once I have it.
 
 

 while.  FEA told us a couple of years ago I believe that they do not have 
 maintenance available for these products any longer.  So, you don't need to 

 

 through 10/20/2000.
 
 If you have any questions, please let me know.  Otherwise, I will proceed 

 licenses.
 
 Thanks,
 Karla
