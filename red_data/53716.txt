 Long time no talk.  Things are going pretty well with the new business
 not so well with my marriage, but the kids are very good.  Anyway, I was
 wondering if you being the consummate researcher that you are might be
 able to get hold of a copy of the May, June, July (or around there) 1996
 Power Risk magazine that had the article about me going to Southern.  It
 will be useful for me in my litigation.  Hope all is well with you and
 yours especially for Vincent now that he's left school.  Do you ever get
 to Atlanta?  I may be coming to Houston for a short assignment and will
 look you up if I do.  Take care.
