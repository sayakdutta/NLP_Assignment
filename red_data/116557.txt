 
 wait - i thought you weren't going to go there on corporate e-mail. where did 
 this sudden attack come from? that's low - especially considering i'm deathly 
 ill but still slaving away at work to band-aid the mistakes you guys spend 
 all day making. and you are sadly mistaken in the rumors you've heard - i've 
 never endeavored upon anything with anyone. my birdcage, if i had one, would 
 be lined with your e-mails.

 you harass me....  need i mention a certain relationsip that you endeavered 
 upon with a gentleman by the name of Mr. Bill Williams?  at least I do not 
 interact by choice......  and I'm not sure interact is precisely the right 
 word.  What is your birdcage lined with? His love letters?

 I'm sorry, but your superior and omnipotent ruler, Bill, has asked that I 
 copy all of his mignons on this e-mail. So I really don't care whether or not 
 you care. Print it out and line your birdcage.
