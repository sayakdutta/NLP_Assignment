 Naveen,
 I was trying to find "fat tails". I looked at NG prompt month prices' 
 log-returns for 5 years  9 months.
 On the figure below you can see the comparison of empirical cumulative 
 probability function with normal 
 cumulative for this time series (standardized: mean subtracted, divided by 
 stdev). The effect of fat tails
 is not pronounced so much. The "fat tails" effect was much more visible on 
 your plot when you looked at the 
 oct-00 prices log-returns versus my time series of prompt month's prices.
 The shape of the distribution is different from normal, though, and fits well 
 with the volatility switching model.
 
 Tanya.
