 
 GE is asking for invoicing instructions for equipment currently in TP.  I 
 don't recall that being addressed in the documents they signed, and  I didn't 
 see an obvious answer in the documents I reviewed.  Any problem with Ben 
 receiving the invoices for now, then he can process through GF, etc?
 
 Thanks,
