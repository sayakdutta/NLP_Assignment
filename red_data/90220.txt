 Thanks.
 
  
     
 Yes I did and her response is below....she said she would put you on the waiting list.  Honestly, it doesn't look good...so I can check with our contact directly.
 
 Let me know
 
  
     
 Did you check with Liz?
 
  
     
 Doesn't look like there are any tickets available...do you want me use the MVP account and try to get you some?
 
 Let me know.
 
  
     
 No.  They are all taken, however if anyone cancels, I'll put him on the waiting list.

 Liz,
 
 Kevin would like to know if Greg has any available tickets for the remaining games?  He would prefer a weekend however, if a weekday game is available that would be great.
 
 Thanks for checking,
