 What does the Kergan think of his Jeep? I think I am going to get one of those. Unless you have forgotten the Kergan's where an acient people from the steps of Russia who , for entertainment, tossed children in pits with wild dogs to fight for food.
 
  
     
 Oh yeah!!! I'm down with that....
 
 
 
 
 
     
 
 When I am back in Calgary your whole desk is going to have listen to this
 shit all day over the box...

       Don't forget pink fuzzy dice and chain steering wheel and red
    interior
       lights. Chicks are going to love it. I'm going to get a chick with a
       python
       wrapped around her painted on the side and get those tires that stick
       out 6
       inches from the wheel wells with gold plated rims. SWEET! The funny
       thing
       is that in some neighborhoods in Houston (predominately latin) that
       would
       be a killer ride.

             loves
             those things....
 
 
 
 
             
                                                     
 
             Listen to this shit. If I want to move my car back to Canada I
          (Enron)
             would have to pay $2000 USD to move it plus 6.1% of KBB value
    in
          import
             duty plus 7% GST plus $200 excise tax plus about $400 in
    permits.
          Looks
             like I am looking for a new car as well.
