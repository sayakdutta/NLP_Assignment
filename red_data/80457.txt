 Dear Mr. McConnell, my name is Rudy Hirschheim, and I'm the past Director
 of the Information Systems Research Center at the University of Houston.
 Enron is a member of our group and I was friends with Alberto Gude, Enron's
 former IT Director. I have a request that I wondered if you could help with.
 
 Perez Companc - a big oil and gas company in Argentina - is trying to
 understand how some of the big US companies are dealing with IT. Basically
 interested in issues such as sourcing arrangements, structure
 (centralized/decentralized/distributed), customer relationships, use of
 packaged software, 'e' issues, and such like. They want me to try to set up
 meetings with some key US companies here in Houston. Among the companies
 which I suggested they talk to is yours. Do you think someone/some group
 would be willing to talk to a contingent of Perez Companc folks? Would
 Enron be willing to share things which weren't considered
 competitive secrets with them?? They were hoping to come up either the
 first or second week in March. My role is to try to put together visits to
 the Shell/Texaco JV, Shell, Texaco, Exxon-Mobil, Conoco, BHP, Enron,
 Chevron. Do you think it is possible? Again, nothing of a competitive
 nature has to be offered, they just are trying to determine what they ought
 to be doing with respect to IT.
 
 Thanks in advance.
