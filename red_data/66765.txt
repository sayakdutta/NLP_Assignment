 
 You are definitely welcome.  Are you coming in for systems training next week (or it that Spring Break)?
 
 
     
 
 Just wanted to thank you and Teb for taking time out to join us for lunch on Wednesday.  If there is anything I can ever do for you, please
 do not hesitate to give me a call.  Though I can never fill Julie's shoes, I look forward to working with you both in the months to come.
 Have a great weekend.
 
 All the Best....Ronnie
