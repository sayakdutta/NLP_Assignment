 My gut tells me that we should tackle this by trying to get some sort of understanding about when translation will be completed and when our papers will be forwarded to Kazakhstan.  Because frankly telling us that we can travel 10 days after the other group means nothing if our paperwork hasn't been turned in sufficient time.
 
 
 
     
 
 Shelley,
 No, she didn't, and I was too upset about the late November time frame to 
 ask. I was thinking about emailing her and asking her when the documents 
 would be sent and about how long before we have a court date. I didn't even 
 confirm that the 15th was a set date for the other group, but I assume it is. 
 If we leave a week or so after them, that puts us leaving right at 
 Thanksgiving, which means higher airfare etc...
 Should one of us email her or call her and ask?
