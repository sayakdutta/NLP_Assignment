 
 After reviewing the Doorstep audit at Long Beach with the team I have the following conclusion:
 
 1. We should shut these offices down because we can not control them. They don't make much money and will be a huge negative after losses at Long Beach.
 
 ---or----
 
 2. We establish a rigid template for how these offices operate. My thought is that we create a McDonalds Hamburger type operation. Each office is exactly the same and operates under precise and well communicated rules. "Hamburger" quality is monitored from Houston routinely.
 
 There are a huge number of these remote offices so we need to address how we proceed.
 
 Any thoughts? Rick
