 the MDEA rep needs to reveiw it.  
 
 Reagan has my current requests.

 Kay -- Do you know if David H. is going to give you comments?  If you haven't 
 heard for sure, one of us will call Marvin and find out/coordinate.  Just 
 don't want to call if this has already been discussed with them.
 
 Is there anything else at this stage that we can do to help your efforts on 
 the Extension or the main agreement?
 
 Thanks  -- David

 Sounds good if you would like to forward to counter parties.  
 
 I've sent a draft to their counsel all ready (D Hunt and Hemleben).

 Kay -- Looks fine.  Unless anyone else has changes, would it be possible to 
 send it out today?  Thanks -- David
