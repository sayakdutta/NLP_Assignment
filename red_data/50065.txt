 Thanks for your message. A call sometimes between 7:00 and 8:00
 is fine. I come to the office around 7:00 traffic permitting.

 Dear Mr. Kaminsky,
 
 Mr. Bryant informed me of the possibility of having you as a guest speaker
 for our speaker series. It would be a great honor and a pleasure for me to
 help you organize a trip to Pittsburgh. Would it be possible to give you a
 call tomorrow (thursday) at 7.00am central time?
 
 Sincerely,
 
 
 Pierre-Philippe Ste-marie
