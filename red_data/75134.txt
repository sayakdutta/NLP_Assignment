 were me (and not him), I would have you send it under your own name, but 
 explain that you are helping Carlos.
 
 
    
  
 I am getting ready to send Michelle Blaine a question regarding some proposed 
 gifts that Mat Gimble and crew want to give the "new" Seminole Indian Chief.  
 Would you rather the question be sent by you?  If so, let me know and I will 
 explain, otherwise I will just copy you on the e-mail.
