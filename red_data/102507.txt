 Ray Williams relayed to me that you would like to sign the Rule 51 agreement
 so you can get our prior Workshop materials.  All you need to do is fill out
 the information form, initial (electronically) on the appropriate line, and

  <<Gas Accord II Information Form.doc>>
 
 Here is a copy of Rule 51.  Nothing needed on this document.  It is only for
 your reference.
  <<CPUC Rule 51.doc>>
 Call if you have questions.
