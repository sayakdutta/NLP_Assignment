 
 Nora:
 
 I checked two other ENE subsidiary agreements and found:
 
 (1)  We have successfully negotiated a limitation of liability clause (ENE's format)
 
 (2)  We have been able to amend Par. 2 to "delete all references to affiliates of GS&Co, including the words "or any of your affiliates" and "each of your affiliates" wherever such words appear AND delete the words "without notice to Client " in the sixth line and replacing them with "without prior notice to Client, but with reasonable notice thereafter" AND deletethe last sentence of Section 2
 
 (3)  Section 4: same as (2) above
 
 Let me know if I can help further -
