 Today, I revised the $70,000.00 wire to $989,700.00.
 
 This money gets applied to the following April deals on Florida;
 			April 1st	10,000 dth x 1 day x $3.27 =
 $32,700.00
 			April 2nd-30th	10,000 dth x 29 days x $3.30 =
 $957,000.00
 					Total Prepayment
 $989,700.00
 
 I'm not sure if anyone is using the attached worksheet but I've included
 the baseload wire and purchase information on the summary tab.

 >  Prepay to Reliant for April Trunkline deal (sitara #1202698)   6,800
 dth x 30 days x $3.44 per dth = $701,760.00
 > This item is NOT included on my worksheet.  I did this deal with Jim
 Taylor yesterday.
 >
 > Prepay to Reliant for swing supply on Florida and Trunkline $40,000.00
 (normal weekly prepay).
 > Prepay to Reliant for possible intraday supply on Florida (volume up
 to 10,000 dth per day) $70,000.00.
 >
 > I have combined the $40,000 and $70,000 on my worksheet but I'm not
 sure how my cash department will wire the funds.  As of today, ENA has
 not purchased any swing supply on Trunkline Reliant and I do not
 anticipate very much activity on this deal.

 > P.S.  Jim, according to Tallahassee, on February 27th that they
 requested 2,000 dth and they only received 1,550 dth.  Would you have
 someone in your shop verify that before I make an adjustment to the
 worksheet please.
