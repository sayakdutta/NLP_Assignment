 restructuring.  In the past it was easy enough to justify using Don's budget 
 since in theory all of your work was for his benefit.  Now it isn't quite so 
 clear.  I think we need to figure out exactly who you are supporting - is 
 there a separate RC for Argentina trading?

 Do you have any information on this?

 Hi Brent!
 
 Quick question.  In the past I have been charging your expenses to RC 0303 
 which is Don Black's and Scott  Neal's RC.  You are listed in the system as 
 having RC 0807.  Which should I be using?  Should your expenses come out of 
 Don's and Scott's budget or yours?
