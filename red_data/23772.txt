 Good morning, Stacy.
  I have reviewed the Guaranty forwarded last evening by Rudwell
 Johnson.  He requested that I get back to you with comments.  Please note my
 changes on the attached.  As Rudwell suggested, in the second paragraph  I
 have included language that limits this Guaranty to the two transactions
 that we working on.  In the same vein, I have also included language (see
 paragraph 17) that ensures that any other guarantees will not be cumulative
 with this one.  I assume that we will do a separate guaranty to use as
 Exhibit D to the Master Purchase Agreement.  Any questions, please call me
 at 908-719-4228.
