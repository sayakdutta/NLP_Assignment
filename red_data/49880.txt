 Update:
 
 Preparations for the upcoming Texas Finance Festival III are about complete
 and I just wanted to update you on the hotel reservations information.  You
 will need to make your reservation before March 20 to be assured of getting
 a room in our reserved block.  Also, for "counting" purposes I need
 everyone's registration form completed.  Many of you (and a lot of new
 faces) have already sent them in but some may not have, so . . .
 
 Lots of fun stuff is planned so come prepared for a very relaxing and
 productive weekend!
