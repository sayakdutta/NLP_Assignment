 Glen,
 
 YOUR ALIVE..!!!!!!!!!!   Glad to see you are still around.   What's with the new job?  For me the new job is obvious.  We started playing a drinking game where every time the name Enron was mentioned you had to do a shot.  Minutes later I was fired for drunken insubordination.  Sometime in the next 3-4 weeks I'll start working for UBS Warburg (Union Bank of Switzerland).  I'm hoping working for a Swiss company may finally get me out of the middle of all the conflicts (Terrorism, Enron, Anthrax).  No one should want to harm the Canadian working for the Swiss company.
 

 
 How's the personal life going?  I hope all is well.
 
 Jon

 Hey Jonny, sorry I missed you over New Years....I went out to TO on the 28th
 for a week....life's been kind of shitty lately so I probably wouldn't have
 been much fun anyway...hope you had a good xmas and new year....how're
 things down there and with Enron?
 
 As you can see, I have a new email address and phone number...
