 Great.  Can you e-mail the cash request you sent to doug?
 
  
     
 The answer is yes. Money was received Friday and Doug should be getting approval to send the other out today.
 
  
     
 I assume ENA gets credited with the oney wired in on Friday re Centana.
 
 What's the status on the wire going out today.  Do you have a cash request completed?
 
 Let me know this morning.  Thanks.
