 
 Issue 1 - Mike Swerzbin
 Missing deal = 524266 (Enron buys EES - 25 mw - off peak - Mid C - Q3'01 - 
 price is $285.95)
  Mike Driscoll just spoke with Amerex broker, who confirmed he wanted the 
 five-cent fee on a different deal (524247), not this one. Our price is right.
 
 Issue 2 - Mike Swerzbin
 Mike agreed to 50 mw, but if we change this deal we have to change the other 
 side - therefore, 524267 and 524266 will both be changed to 50 mw.
 
 Issue 3 - Diana Scholtes
 This is the first I think I've heard about 523984 - I'm sorry if I overlooked 
 it. Diana says it's $345 - it's been changed.
 
 Let me know if this resolves everything.

 Let's start over: 
 
 
 ISSUE 1-Mike Swerzbin
 deal 524248 and deal 524266
 This two deals checkout with Amerex fine.  Amerex has one deal at 50 mw and 
 we have two identical deals at 25 mw.
 
 deal 524247
 This deal checks out with Amerex fine.
 
 The deal that I am missing is Enron buys from EES 25 mw of off-peak Mid-C for 
 Q3'01 at $285.95.
 
 
 ISSUE 2- Mike Swerzbin
 deal 524267
  Amerex has 50 mw and we have 25 mw.
 
 ISSUE 3- Dianna Scholtes
 deal 523984
 Amerex has price as $345 and we have price as $335.
 
 
 This has been a terrible ordeal and I will be so glad when everthing is 
 resolved!!!
 
 Thanks
