 
 Would we be better off letting the trade associations fight this one out?  I 
 haven't read the pleading yet, but from your description, I wouldn't be 
 surprised if all of them oppose it--AGA included.  DF  
 
 




  
  RP01-223
 
 The National Association of Gas Consumers (an association of municipal gas 
 systems) has filed a complaint against all sellers of natural gas in the US 
 to re-impose wholesale prices caps.  They are seeking a benchmark (soft cap) 
 of $2.74/MMBtu.
 
 The benchmark figure is based on an average gas forecast from a recent 
 National Petroleum Council study.  (Ken Lay is a member of the NPC).
 
 The procedural rules are a bit fuzzy.  Ordinarily, respondents have 20 days 
 to answer a complaint.   However, FERC rules provide for service on 
 respondents.  Here NAGC has not named specific respondents.
