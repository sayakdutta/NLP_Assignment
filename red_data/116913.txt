 
 We will be short in Real Time Position Manager both at NP-15 and SP-15 for 
 1/18/01 until Friday morning. It seems that four deals were entered by EES 
 under the wrong desk, affecting our position instead of theirs. Following are 
 the details of where, when, why and by how much we're out. Read this 
 carefully....
 
 SP-15 - Short 1950.64 MW
  Deal #500492 - 67.89 MW short off peak
  Deal #500493 - 87.97 MW short on peak
 
 NP-15 - Short 2883.08 MW
  Deal #500494 - 102.61 MW short off peak
  Deal #500495 - 128.89 MW short on peak
 
 If any one of you has better luck than I have at accessing EES deals in deal 
 entry, by all means get rid of these. Or if you happen to speak with Suneet 
 Sharma, our good friend who entered the deals in question, by all means tell 
 him to do the same.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate
