 be better if not sent at all.  It doesn't address the real underlying problem 
 -- that a "reliability bill" on a stand alone basis doesn't fix the problem.  
 Instead, the letter implies that the reason for opposition is merely a 
 political consideration -- ie that it may reduce Congress' appetite for 
 action next year.  If possible, it would be better not to have the letter go 
 out at all.
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 

  
  
 Per my first e-mail, here's MidAmerican's position letter on the stand alone 
 Reliability measure.  Seems the best we can do with the utilities who have 
 been supporting our position is to have them take a "no position" stance on 
 the stand alone bill.
