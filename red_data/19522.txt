 
 That's exactly right.  But I would say that Loretta, not Brown, was the winner, and will continue to be the winner.
 
 Best,

 PS Can you give a call when you get a minute at 415.782.7822?  Thanks.
 
 
     
 
 It was held only after Brown insisted that it be held and only after Loretta
 took a voice vote to over-rule Brown's hold.  Duque and Bilas joined Brown
 in taking the item off the agenda.  I saw Brown this morning.  He's pissed
 and he called Loretta a liar.  Somehow, he knew what was going to happen and
 he prevented it.
 
 
     
 
 you mean to hold it?
 
 
     
 
 Well, it looks like Loretta isn't as smart as she thinks she is....
