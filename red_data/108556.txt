 Enron is the major underwriter of a very unique and INNOVATIVE exhibit at the 
 Museum of Fine Arts ... Star Wars:  The Magic of Myth.   It will be on 
 display from March 11 - June 24, 2001 and we're really excited about it!  We 
 know that there are going to be a variety of ways to involve the business 
 units, employees and our external customers, and therefore we are asking you 
 to participate on a steering committee to make sure that we leverage this to 
 Enron's maximum potential.   Your expertise is needed!
 
 Our kick-off meeting will be Monday, October 16th at 3 p.m.  in 4C2.  I will 
 explain the exhibit in further detail at that time.  Please let me know if 
 you are able to attend.  Cookies will be served ... 
 
 Thanks in advance for your help in what I am certain will be a fantastic 
 collaboration between Enron and the Museum of Fine Arts!
