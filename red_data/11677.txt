 Rick,
 I have 6.5 days of vacation left
 I have planned to take dec 17 - dec 19 (Mon-Wed).  I will be back in the office Thurs 12/20 and plan to be available through the holidays and after that as long as needed.  Pat Cini has agreed to be in the office on those days and I will be available via mobile.
 Thanks
 Ted
