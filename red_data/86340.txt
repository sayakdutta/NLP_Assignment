 
 Lets use whatever bank is easier. Wish me luck on finding someone else to buy this gas. Lets hope we don't have to go that route.

 Just an update. I spoke with Mike Richards and later today he will send
 me the rest of his comments so that we can be ready to finalize the deal
 if Greg returns and is ready to pull the trigger. 
 
 Mike inquired of their bank and apparently they can open an escrow
 account with slightly lower fees. Mike thinks the difference is about
 $1500. Given the lack of control over the process and the fact that we
 have an escrow account already finalized, I told him that I didn't think
 ENA was interested in their opening another account, but I wanted to
 check with you Joe.
 
 Last, I checked and there is no jeopardy from a bankruptcy perspective
 of finding a new buyer for the gas in the event that Centana declines to
 move forward.
