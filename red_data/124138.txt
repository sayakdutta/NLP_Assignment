 East Delivery Points for Facilities
 
 
  
     
 just an fyi....
 
  
     
 Kim,
 
 I'm attaching a spreadsheet that details the regions and delivery points we would like to have migrated over to the Global Facilities database for UBS.  There are two separate tabs - one for regions and one for delivery points.  I have left a message with John in Portland to call me in the morning and I will have him compile the same information for you for the west.
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions!
 Thanks!
 Casey
