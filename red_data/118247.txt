 
 I understand that there may be a few additional changes but these are the 
 revisions from our meeting on Monday.

 Attached are copies of the documents which have been revised in accordance 
 with our meeting last Monday. Each document can be viewed in "native" or 
 redline format to highlight the changes.
 
 I'm not sure if outside counsel needs to see these, or just be told by inside 
 counsel that the changes have been made - I'll leave it to you to forward in 
 the morning if required.
 
 The Help Guide contains a new Glossary of Terms, but we will be adding (and 
 subtracting) to this tomorrow. We will send a revised glossary when complete.
