 
 ok, I see Russel and Chucks touch all through this.
 
  
     
 Roses are red.
 Violets are blue.
 You're a pain in the ass,
 But I s'pose I am, too.
 
 So oft when we meet,
 We fuss and we fight.
 It becomes hard to see
 That we share a love of great might.
 
 But no matter the tears,
 Or gut wrenching fears.
 As we grow old,
 We create a togetherness,
 Lovely to behold.
