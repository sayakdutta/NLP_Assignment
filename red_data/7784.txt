 
 I have asked Patti to send Sharron a list of all employees within Energy 
 Operations (a BIG list) and another one with managers and above (perhaps a 
 more manageable list) for this effort.  Since you went to the meeting I 
 didn't know whether or not you were following up on this.  Just wanted to let 
 you know that I have asked Patti to do this.  Thanks.

 In staff meeting last week, Rick mentioned that he would like to sponsor a 
 year-end celebration for accounting employees and spouses sometime in the 
 next month.  I need a list of accounting personnel in your group.  We need 
 this ASAP because the number of employees will determine the size of the 
 facility needed.
