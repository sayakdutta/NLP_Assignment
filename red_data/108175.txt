 it isn't dead, but things are moving slowly.
 
 the deal was initiated and is still being headed by jarek astramovicz (sp?)  
 head of the warsaw office.  he says he is getting the green light from 
 sheriff to proceed, despite the potential headlines.  however, the lead 
 finance/origination guy here in london, michael mills, has resigned.  i 
 talked to paul chivers about the deal yesterday and he will take mills' spot 
 temporarily.  
 
 in the meantime the polish govt has also ruled that pkn (owners of other 
 polish ref) will not be allowed to bid, as jarek predicted, and which puts us 
 in a good position.
 
 we have not done anything yet, because i did not want to start working on 
 something that did not get official backing, and support from finance.
 what we will need to do as soon as everybody has gotten over the 
 ramifications, is put together the various curves (fob basis) for the main 
 products for 3-5 years out (length of our potential put option).  so far our 
 attitude is that we treat this as an export ref and we will deal with the 
 products as such.  any money made from the internal market will be gravy.
 
 if we get management sign-off, this deal has a high potential of happening, 
 and we will be handed 25pct of a refinery, and probably control over the 
 products execution and hedging.
 will keep you posted.   
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
   
  
 Any updates on the Gdansk refinery, or should I assume that the deal is dead?
