 
 Please inactivate the FT-INT-CNT-TRAN book in TAGG.  All of the sub books 
 associated with this should also be inactivated, i.e. Price, Basis, Index and 
 GD.  The trader responsible for these books has been gone for over 6 months 
 and all the deals in that book have now rolled off.  If you need any further 
 information, please feel free to give me a shout.  Thanks for your help.
