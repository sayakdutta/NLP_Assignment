 Shemin, attached below is your last draft of the letter agreement with our
 additional comments.  Some of the comments we previously discussed on the
 phone.  I understand my business person is having discussions with Enron
 management to try and resolve a number of issues with Enron.  Therefore,
 the results of those discussions may cause additional comments from us to
 this Letter Agreement..  In addition, my business person is currently out
 of the office, so these comments are subject to his review and additional
 changes.  We are fine with the Escrow Agreement as long as it is understood
 that Enron will pay all costs associated with the Escrow Agreement.
