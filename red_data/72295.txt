 
 Chris,
 
 Please do not ask outside counsel to participate in a call, undertake a task, 
 or do anything without talking to me, Carlos, or another Enron lawyer 
 first.   
 
 You do not need to call Carolyn and tell her not to participate.  Carlos has 
 taken care of this already.

 Kay,
 
 Are you available for a conference call today at 1:00 PM to discuss the 
 NorthWestern deal/issues.  If so, I will ask Carolyn Campbell not to 
 participate in the call.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Chris
