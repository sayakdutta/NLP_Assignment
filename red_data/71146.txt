 either Jan 12 or 15.

 Citibank just confirmed that they will also accept faxed signatures on the 
 Escrow Agreement.  Have you approved it yet?  If so, and we let accounting 
 know to wire the funds to Citibank before 2:00, we can get the $ in the 
 Escrow Account by tomorrow.  Otherwise, the funds will not get there until 
 Friday.
