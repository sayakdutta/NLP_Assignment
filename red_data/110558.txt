 program.  Either that or Ted's buying time to go out and find more 
 candidates.   It's very dissappointing that we have heard absolutely nothing 
 thus far.  I'm too chickenshit to ask Phillip.  Early today three of the six 
 people I interviewed with were in my area talking...its sucks just knowing 
 that they know and aren't offering any info.
