 Sounds great--   but there aren't "provinces" in UK; and didn't she murder
 some kid in Massachusetts?
 

 I have a friend here from the UK who came to this county with a British
 family as a nanny for their two girls.  She was told this weekend that
 due to some financial difficulties they would no longer be able to continue
 her employment.  She does not wish to return to England at this time and
 is seeking to find another position with a family here ASAP.  The family
 she is currently with would recommend her highly.  Her name is Elizabeth
 Nugent and she comes from a very good family in northern England. (Her
 father is governor of a province there.)   She is university educated in
 child care and elementary education.  She is also NVQ (National
 Vocational Qualification) Level 3 qualified and has taught in both the
 private and public systems there in England.  She is twenty four years
 old.  She has excellent references and letters of recommendation.  If you
 or someone you know is seeking a well qualified British nanny please
 contact me at (713) 221-1361 for more information.  Thank you.
