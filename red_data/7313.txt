 
 I was in Austin the end of last week recruiting at UT and (in a sense of 
 open-mindedness and fair play) was at OU on Sunday night and Monday 
 recruiting as well. James and I have not had a chance to talk following your 
 conversations.  Nor am I really caught up on e:mail messages.  I have some 
 tight deadlines on a couple of things for Friday, so it may be Monday before 
 James and I have the opportunity to talk in any detail.  
 
 
 
 

    
 
 Sally,
 We had a good meeting with James last week - I hope you have had the
 opportunity to talk with him about it. What are the next steps? Would you
 like to get together and have a mini-planning session on developing the
 business maturity model around your business opportunities? We got a chance
 to talk with James a little on that front, but he is not sure where your
 thinking is on some of these approaches. I believe that is the best way to
 get the changes you are seeking and accomplish the other business objectives
 at the same time. Please let me know.
 Thanks,
