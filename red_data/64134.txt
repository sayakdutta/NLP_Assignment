 
 i am going there for basically two days the second week of aug.  i won't have 
 much time.  hopefully i will meet them for lunch or something but it is 
 definately going to be a short visit.  at least i will be back two weeks 
 later.  did grandma get her truck?    hopefully you and billy can make it 
 over labor day weekend.  i just bought a new car.  it is actually a used 
 chevy tahoe.  i love it.  it is so much nicer than the jeep.  it is too nice 
 for me but as long as i am meeting my goals in savings each month i think i 
 can afford it.  hope all is well.  tell billy hello.
