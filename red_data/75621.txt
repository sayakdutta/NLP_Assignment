  Attached please find the latest draft of the Fountain Valley/GE
 Facility Agreement (the second document attached below), as well as a
 blackline showing changes to the original form agreed to with GE.  This
 revised draft incorporates (a) all of Lee's comments but for his
 comments on Section 10.6 and Exhibit B - 550 psig (for which I am still
 awaiting confirmation), (b) Kay's comments on Exhibit S and (c) John
 Rigby's comments.  To complete we will need to insert the date the
 agreement is signed, confirm the specific performance guarantees and the
 items in (a) above, and insert Exhibit H-2 manually.  I will be out of
 the office for the remainder of the day.  In my absence, please contact
 Chris Cobb at (202) 662-3016.
