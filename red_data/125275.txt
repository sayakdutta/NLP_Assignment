 See the attached document.
 
 I do not propose any language at this time to cover the eventuality of Children (except for what is in the Will). Any changes that would be needed to my beneficiary designations for the two Brown & Company accounts and the Enron insurance benefits will simply be made as and when needed.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Paul
