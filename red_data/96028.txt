 Dear Chris, 
 
 As discussed with my colleague Tracy Ngo, attached please find a draft 
 agreement which would cover the proposed arrangement between EPMI, MEGA and 
 PGET. It is in a form acceptable to both PGET and EPMI. If the arrangement is 
 to go ahead, please give me any comments from your attorneys ASAP.  Also, if 
 it goes ahead, we will need to know the details of the master agreement 
 between MEGA and PGET, and receive a copy of the relevant transaction 
 confirmation. 
 
 Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. 
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Shari Stack
