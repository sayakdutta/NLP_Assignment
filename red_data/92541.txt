 
 Sorry I missed you guys for lunch yesterday.  I didn't get your email until 
 yesterday afternoon.  I've been in class for two days...Derivatives I.  It's 
 really hard to sit still and think about swaps and options when I'd rather 
 think about Sydney!  But I guess it's better than being at my desk all day.  
 The days are pretty slow.  It doesn't really get busy here until 3:30 or so.  
 
 Bye,
 Robin
 
 PS If I forget my bras, I'm just not going to bother!!
