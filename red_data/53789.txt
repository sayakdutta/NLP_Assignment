 
 Gary,
 
 He looks like a well qualified candidate but we receive
 hundreds of such resumes. The way to
 distinguish between different candidates is to ask
 the question: Did an individual make an effort
 and invested his time to learn things directly  useful
 to Enron?
 
 Given our work load, I would not accept a person
 who has general quantitative skills but expects that
 Enron will train him from ground zero in all other
 disciplines. We had recently a candidate who wrote a letter
 and complained about being asked questions about
 energy economics, finance, etc. during an interview.
 
 We can interview the candidate over the phone and see if he knows anything
 beyond math.

 Is there a fit?

 Gary - 
 
 Thank you for the referral.  Obviously, this individual is very intelligent and highly skilled - but I do not see a fit for th e analyst/associate program.  
 
 I will have my group send a letter to him indicating our decision not to bring him in for interviews for the pool.  
 
 I did have one suggestion for you though.  You may want to pass his resume by Vince Kaminski for his review.  Vince has specialized needs and this candidate may be better suited for his group.
 
 Thanks again, 
 
 Traci
 
  
     
 Traci, attached is the resume of the individual that would like to join Enron.  He is highly qualified, PhD Mathematics.
 
 If there is a fit, let him know.  If not, let him know.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Gary
 
 
    
 
   
  
 Billy, can you use a PhD from A&M in the A&A program?
