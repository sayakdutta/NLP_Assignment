 sales?  I seem to recall that we already discussed that and the accountants 
 wanted to mention the source of the sold gas, but if I'm wrong, lets make the 
 reference less specific.  Thanks. DF    
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 

  
  
 Here are the paragraphs in the 3QTR 10Q relative to ETS that contain 
 references to our base gas sales.  We have suggested the change shown to 
 de-emphasize the fact that there were sales in both years.   Do you want to 
 suggest any further changes in the next draft we receive for review?
