 
 Marc,
 
 Here's a draft reply to your latest e-mail, which I would send to all those 
 copied on your note to me.  What do you think?
 
 Marc,
 
 We have sought, and paid for, advice from Indian counsel concerning commodity 
 derivative transactions with Indian counterparites.  We have had that advice 
 updated and confirmed in connection with this proposed transaction.  The 
 result of that advice is that we will require an opinion from DPC's outside 
 counsel that the proposed transaction is enforceable against DPC before the 
 transaction can proceed.  While I have no legal objection to sending a form 
 of L/C that would be acceptable to us, it doesn't make much sense to go 
 through the exercise if DPC will not be providing the necessary opinions.
