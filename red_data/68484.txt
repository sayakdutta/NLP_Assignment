 
 Can you let your group know that we have made some changes in responsibility in Risk Management.  Kam Keiser will be responsible for the West Desk, Scott Palmer will now be responsible for the Central Desk and I will now be responsible for the East Desk.  Please pass this information on and direct future inquiries accordingly.  Thanks.
