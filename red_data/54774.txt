 Just a reminder that final exam time for module 6 is almost upon us (April
 30 to May 4)!
 
 If you need a slot reserved for your exam please contact Linda Werckle at
 713-348-3463 as soon as possible.  Space is filling up quickly and we have
 many demands for this period of time.  We want you to have the best time
 possible so contact Linda as soon as you know you will be needing a room.
 
 Let me know if you have any questions!
