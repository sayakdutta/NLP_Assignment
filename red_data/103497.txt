 many issues on the paper desk regarding options.  Sara

 Hey Sara,
 
 Would you please look over this omnibus option template that I took from TAGG 
 and modify it as you see fit for the Paper World?
 
 Many thanks,
 
 Lucy
 
 P.S.
 This particular deal is for a paper DRAFT, but I thought  we should have the 
 template in place anyway.  For future deals of course.
