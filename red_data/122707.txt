 pix tonight and see if I can get a CD done.   I'll get the invitation next 
 time I can bare to be around you.

 Dude,
 
 When Melissa gets her pictures developed, can you see if they can put

 Finally, I still have your "invitation" that you bought at the airport.
 It was a good thing to buy because the one I received in the mail is
 just like it.
