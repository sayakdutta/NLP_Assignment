 I spoke with Gordon.  The assets that he knew about were ones that we have already looked at.  I was very nice and told him that I was appreciative of his notifying us about them.  
 
 I owe him a call to tell him whether we are still pursuing these projects or whether we have given up on them.  Gordon wanted to be sure that we had no interest before bringing these projects to his other clients' attention.
