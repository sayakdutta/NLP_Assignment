 
 Well hey there to you!  Man, long time.  I figured you must be married with 
 kids by now.
 
 Well, I can tell you that my summer's probably a whole heckuvalot better 
 since I'm not in the summer class.  I'm assuming that you're doing it in 
 order to get out in 5 semesters?  I decided to do it in 6, but wil only have 
 to take one class the last semester.
 
 Been thinking about you (as I've watched my Sun stock crater).  How's it 
 going?  What the heck you doing there?
 
 I'm surprised that you've lasted that long in the South Bay.  Good luck 
 looking for a place in SF----smart move.
 
 I'm around in August and definitely up for a Happy Hour.
 
 Don't be a Stranger, Stranger.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Hey there!
 
 How are you?  How's your summer? I'm nearing the end
 of summer school and cannot wait til it's over. The
 class has been a new low point in terms of educational
 value-it sucks! ...in fact, I'm in class now. 
 
 Work is fine-not thrilling.  Again-I'm thinking about
 taking advantage of Sun's flexible work deal and
 moving back up to the city. I do not like the south
 bay much. 
 
 Trying to get a happy hour together in August...are
 you around?
 
 Let me know how you are...
 Courtney
