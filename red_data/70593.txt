 
 Attached is a revised version of the consent to assignment.  This version is 
 specific to the ESA deal, but I'm told that the TurboPark version can be 
 expected to be close to the same.
 
 Kent, I'm awaiting final Enron input on the facility agreement as well, and I 
 will let you know as soon as I get it.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
