 Sara,
 
 Some thoughts on some of these:
 
 Entergy Power Marketing - shouldn't be using anymore - Axia is the mktg JV 
 for Koch and Entergy
 LG&E - hardly ever see trades here anymore; once in a blue moon we see 
 something - not worth anyone's time
 PMI - highly negotiated their paper; not going to touch it
 Cross Timbers, Belco, Breitburn, Cabot - all Fred customer's - I would not 
 hold my breath
 Dynegy Canada - should already be on our list
 Dynegy - should convert to an ISDA
 Reliant - should convert to an ISDA
 MSCG - should convert to an ISDA
 
 The rest can wait for another time.
 
  
     
 Attached is a list of high volume "old" ECT Masters which was obtained from 
 the confirmation desk.  Many of them appeared on our working list from last 
 year.  
 
 Tanya:  We have enough legal help to pursue the names on the list.  Would you 
 like to prioritize or amend?
