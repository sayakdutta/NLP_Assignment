 Do we know what case this request has been made in and if we're one of the 5 
 listed?  Thanks.
 Best,

 FYI re the request for CPUC hearings to investigate alleged price 
 manipulation by generators.

   Greetings: UCAN and Ratepayers have filed a Request for Hearings regarding 
 the actions of certain generation companies in connection with alleged 
 manipulation of California's electricity markets by five pivotal market 
 players.During an informal discussion with another party a question arose 
 about whether the request for hearings included an examination of actions 
 taken by SDG&E, PG&E or Southern California Edison in pursuing claims against 
 alleged market manipulators.  This filing is meant to clarify that UCAN and 
 Ratepayers are not at this time requesting hearings into the actions of SDG& 
 E, PG&E or Southern California Edison in pursuing any such claims they may 
 enjoy.  The requested hearings are proposed to focus on the whether the five 
 pivotal market players had the ability to exercise significant market power 
 so that operation of the new market institutions was distorted.  Thank you 
 for allowing UCAN and Ratepayers to clarify this point.
