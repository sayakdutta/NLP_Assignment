 Dear Mr. Derrick,
 
 I was prompted to contact you because your position as general counsel
 gives you such a broad view of all legal aspects at Enron.  You may be able
 to point me in the right direction: my firm provides due diligence services
 in foreign countries (primarily in Russia and Eastern Europe, China and
 Taiwan).  Our due diligence inquiries are motivated by the clients' need to
 have full information on the companies and individuals with which they are
 dealing abroad.  Often, our due diligence inquiries have a focus on FCPA
 issues.  We have assisted clients from the energy industry (Air Liquide,
 Chevron, ExxonMobil).
 
 You may be able to refer me to counsel in your department who deal with
 such issues, or you may be interested in meeting me.  I will be in Houston
 on May 7 and 8.  I could stop by your office for 30 minutes for a brief
 presentation.
 
 Best regards,
 Bogdan Caceu
