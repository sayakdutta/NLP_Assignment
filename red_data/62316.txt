 John & Louise -
 
 To follow up on our previous meeting regarding the coal initiative, I've attached a brief description of the approach going forward, including some first-cut proforma results.  Our goal over the next month is to more fully vet the cost and operations numbers in the attached and to nail down probable sites.
 
 In mid-April, after we've more fully vetted the costs, we'll route our detailed proforma.
 
 After reviewing, let me know if you have questions or want to discuss further.
 
 Mitch
