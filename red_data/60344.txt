 
 I have never received any expense in my bank account, probably due to the difference in the names on the systems.  This is a huge issue and I need to know how much money is missing immediately and how this gets resolved.  I would think that we issued them in 'Kitchen' and therefore they were bounced by my account which is in 'Nettelton'.  I may be wrong if this is a common problem.
 
 I may never have been paid any.  Please check all expenses going back all year.
 
 This is a huge number which state they have been paid and have not hit my bank account.
 
 Of the expenses showing up not cleared on my bank account I have received none of the payments which I think adds up as follows:
 
 11/13/01	4,069:72
 11/10/01	21,010:15
 11/10/01	3,319:40
 
 Plus I have a cheque for a prior expense which bounced which is for about $4000.
 
 In pre- petition expenses this is clearly more than $5000.
 
 In post petition - I also have expenses pending which will bounce if the name on the payee does not correspond to the account holder name.
 
 Tammie - please work on this as our highest priority tomorrow.
