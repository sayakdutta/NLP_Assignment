 Steve, this is the column I mentioned to you Monday. We do a column under 
 Mark's name for ENA's customer magazine, Exchange. This month's topic is 
 California. I'd like you to read it and see if we are getting the message 
 right. Jeff, please let me know if there are errors.
 
 Once we get your comments, we'll show it to Mark.
 
 Thanks,
 Jeannie
