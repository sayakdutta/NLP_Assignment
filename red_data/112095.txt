 I attach a revised draft of the Policy marked to show changes from the draft
 I circulated Friday.  It incorporates cleanup changes from both sides.
 Exhibit 2 is not yet sufficiently specific to carry the weight it is asked
 to carry in the Policy.  So far as I am aware, we have not yet seen a
 revised Exhibit 1.
