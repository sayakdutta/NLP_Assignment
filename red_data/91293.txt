 =09If I understand your change to the second paragraph correctly, the new c=
 ompressors at Stations 1, 2 and 3 will be completed and placed into service=
  within the one-year deadline in the FERC order. The removal of the existin=
 g units at those stations, however, will not be completed until six months =
 after that. My general feeling is that as long as the old units are taken o=
 ut of service by the one-year deadline and are no longer operational, we sh=
 ould be ok and don't need to ask FERC for an extension. The ordering paragr=
 aph from the FERC order requires that the new facilities be placed in servi=
 ce within one year from the date of the order. It does not impose a similar=
  deadline for the abandonment of the existing facilities. I take it that we=
  would not operate the old and the new facilities at the same time (i.e., c=
 ontinue to operate the existing compressors after we've installed and place=
 d into operation the new compressors), since this would result in TW operat=
 ing compression in excess of its certificated capacity. As long as we don't=
  do that, I don't think there's any need to ask for a separate extension fo=
 r the abandonment.=20

 =09Attached for your review and comments is a draft of a request to FERC to=
  extend the period allowed under the Red Rock certificate for the abandonme=
 nt and replacement of the compressors at Station 4. My understanding is tha=
 t we need to request a one year extension as to Station 4 (but not as to th=
 e other three compressor stations included in the Red Rock expansion) due t=
 o the fact that we haven't fully contracted for all of the capacity authori=
 zed by FERC. Your comments would be appreciated. Thanks.
