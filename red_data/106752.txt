 I'm in the need of informing the whole team that Argentina through the 
 Argentine Association of Derivatives has developed a document that's 
 circulating in the market and will surely be optimised to the extent that 
 Argentine companies will use it in the near future if not inmediately. This 
 document has been prepared by experienced groups of professionals with 
 foreign support on terms of credit and legal issues. 
 
 My impression is that will be competing against that document in a great deal 
 of disadvantage. This disadvantage will be a "cultural" disadvantage from the 
 moment that latin american countries tend to have "shorter" documents written 
 in the local language where the transaction is taking place. 
 If the ISDA was at least written in Spanish (rather than French or German) it 
 would be of great help. This is an issue that really "tickles" me: Why isn't 
 the ISDA document translated into Spanish being that it is after English 
 probably the language most spoken through out the globe and second that 
 there's much more opportunity of selling Risk Management Products to Latin 
 American countries rather than French companies through my more than 
 disappointing experience in trying to close a deal with French Total.
 
 I believe Sara's visit would be more that important. I'll try to forward 
 everybody a copy of the document that was drafted in Argentina for 
 everybody's info.
 
 I strongly believe in the matters of evolution and I'm sure that in the 
 future ESA's market will mature in such a way that will just like Enron 
 Europe a document to match market's needs.
