 Kay:
 
 This morning, Rusty requested that we prepare an Option Agreement for the 29
 acre parcel west of the Livingston Energy Center.  This property could be
 used as a construction laydown site, but more importantly would provide a
 sound buffer for the project.  It is our understanding that the Option
 Agreement is to be presented to the property owner at some point next week.
 We will forward a draft of the agreement to you no later than Monday,
 October 16, 2000.  Please feel free to call me or Don Shindler
 (312-368-2175) with any questions regarding the agreement.  Best regards.
