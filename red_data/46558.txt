 
 It just occurred to me after discussing online trading this morning with Mark 
 for other countries, that I am approving online trading for Mexican 
 counterparties we have a master in place with, however, in my later thinking, 
 did our advice from Mexican counsel address the issue of enforceability of 
 online transactions?
