 
 Julie,
 
 There are many employees in London  who would be interested.
 You can send  an inquiry to Steve Leppard. 
 
 I had a presentation last night
 to GARP in Houston and did a commercial for the book.
 You should put me on commission.

 Vince,
 ?
 I wasn't sure if I responded to your email, so apologise either for my  
 delayed response or repeating myself.
 ?
 Thanks for the 2nd order!? I believe they have already been  dispatched.? 
 Yes, I believe we received payment; thank you very much for  following up 
 with Paul.? Glad the book was a hit!
 ?
 On another subject, are there any Enron?employees in Europe who may be  
 interested in attending either the energy or the weather course?? Or, are  
 the quants and risk management mostly handled out of Houston?
 ?
 Thanks again, and I'll forward an invoice on to Shirley.
 ?
