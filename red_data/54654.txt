 
 Ashley,
 
 This is one resume I got today. I think that it makes sense to invite him
 for an interview directly with my group. He does not qualify as an analyst 
 candidate.
 What do you think?

 Dear Dr. Kaminski,
 It was a pleasure talking with you and attending your talk today.
 I am a graduate student in Industrial Engg. and Operations
 Research working with Prof. Shmuel Oren
 on topics in financial instrument pricing and design of
 contracts in deregulated electricity markets. I am also
 doing research in auction models and computable equilibrium
 models with applications in electricity market design.
 
 I am planning to graduate with a Ph.D. in May 2001 and would
 appreciate hearing about any opportunities in your group at Enron.
 I am attaching at copy of my resume (file: cvrkamat.doc) for your perusal.
 
 Thanking you,
 Sincerely,
 
 Rajnish Kamat
