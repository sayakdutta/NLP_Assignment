 I've added today's comments to remainder of contract, including Patty's 
 latest comments on Sch P and have renamed the file .  I plan to ship this to 
 Fritz in the morning so his people can do the formatting and return it for 
 our shipment to Houston tomorrow night.  You prompt comments would be 
 appreciated.
