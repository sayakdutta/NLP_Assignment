 
 Doesn't strictly qualify as an origination opportunity, but through a 
 contact, I've met with some folks who have some pretty nifty network 
 hardware/software that offers some interesting possibilities w/respect to 
 network performance (optical routing technology).  I'd like to hook them up 
 with network folks, both a technical and a commercial person.  Anyone 
 suggestions?  Thanks.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
