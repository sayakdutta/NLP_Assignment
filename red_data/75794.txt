 Thanks Kay. Let me know when I can talk to them about this. We will need to 
 be in a position to send out docs by Tuesday of next week.

 I've contacted John Keffer and asked them to help.  I will initiate the 
 approval process to get he and Carolyn retained.

 Kay:
 
 As you know, I just love to pile on. I took what I think are the latest form 
 docs and made some changes to incorporate additional commercial terms I want 
 to go out with. Please review the attached clean and redline drafts. In the 
 interest of time, would it be OK for Caroline to review (I've really got 
 people chomping at the bit).
 
 Thanks,
 
 Ben
