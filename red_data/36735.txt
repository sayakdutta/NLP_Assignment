 Darron,
 
 Thank you so much.  It is an awesome letter. I appreciate the time and effort you spent.  One favor...do you think you could ask your admin to put the letter on letterhead?  Jeff wants hard copies, and I thought stationary would look nice.  If not, I can ask her.  Irena, right?  Thanks again.  Have fun in Chicago and tell Phillip hi for me!

 Thank you for agreeing to write a letter of recommending me for the Analyst Program.  I appreciate your time and opinion.  I have included a one page outline to help give you an idea of my accomplishments, job performance, and job development.  This outline is a guideline to help you.  
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thank you again.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Carole Frank
