 
 Per instructions from Brant Reves in Credit dated 5/15/98 (a copy of which 
 has just been provided to me by Global Contracts), please inactivate the 
 Master Agreement [ERMS] with the referenced counterparty.  It appears Aurora 
 Natural Gas Systems LLC is a dba for Aurora Natural Gas, LLC.  We have an 
 ISDA Master Agreement dated 1/20/00 in place with Aurora Natural Gas, LLC and 
 all financial business should be transacted under such ISDA Master.  Further, 
 per Brant's instructions, all trades done with Aurora Natural Gas Systems, 
 LLC should be moved to the correct legal entity, Aurora Natural Gas, LLC.
