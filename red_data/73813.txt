 I talked with Gisele Rankin, attorney for the Public Staff, about tomorrow's
 meeting/conference call.  The Public Staff has not completed its review of
 the material we filed on Friday, but, as I suggested to you yesterday,
 Jeffrey, they will have questions about the PPA with VEPCO, gas supply and
 annexation issues, and follow up cost data.  Gisele said they will also have
 questions about a recent report regarding Enron's plans to build a 144MW
 pure merchant facility in North Carolina to go on line next summer.  If she
 thinks of anything else she will let me know.
 
 I expect the following people from the Public Staff to be present:  Gisele
 Rankin, attorney; Dennis Nightingale, engineer and head of the Electric
 Division; Tom Lam, engineer and member of the Electric Division; Mike Maness
 and Elise Cox from Accounting, and Tom Farmer or Calvin Craig from Economic
 Research.  In other words, it will be crowded.
