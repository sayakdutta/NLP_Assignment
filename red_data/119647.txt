 
 let's ask for it by month.  In talking to Socal Gas, they suggested that we ask the question and explain why we are asking so that the FERC  staff understnads why.  Should we ask the question and then say that this information is needed to determine if actual supplies exist behind the proposed pools since the allocations are being made based on design capapcity and not actual gas.
 
  
     
 We'll send them a request for this information as well as the information on what supplies on their system are split-connected.  
 
  
     
 I was thinking that may be we should ask El Paso to furnish aver. daily volumes that were scheduled as receipts into El Paso' system from the proposed 20 pools from Jan 1- Aug 31 of this year to get an indication of whether there is any gas behind these pools.  What do you think?
