 
 You're probably right, Sharen, since the counterparty continues to send 
 confirmation letters with FPL Energy Power Marketing instead of Florida Power 
 & Light. Unfortunately, the marketer who contacts our trader to transact 
 identifies himself as being with Florida Power & Light, which is where I 
 believe the confusion is coming from. I'll let the traders know of the 
 correct counterparty name, though. 
 
 Thanks for the heads up,
 Kate
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
   
  
 Can you check with the trader on this deal.  We have had to change several 
 deals input with this CP name.  I believe it should be FPL Energy Power Mktg. 
 not  Florida Power & Light Company.  I think one is a utility which would be 
 local and one is a marketer, who can trade anywhere.
 
 Thanks!
