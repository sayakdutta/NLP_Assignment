 All agreements may now be forwarded to Mary Joyce as well as Dana Bryant, our new compensation analyst.  Michelle, please add to your distribution list a copy for Dana (that will work for me as well.)

 Hi Michelle,
 
 I received the employment agreements for Jeff Kinneman for execution by the company.  John Sherriff has signed them and as such I am returning them to you.  However, please confirm that  John Sherriff is permitted to sign on behalf of Enron North America Corp.
 
 As Jeff is a US employee working in Houston with only a dotted line to Europe, I presume that the compensation team in Houston will be loading the executive agreement onto the relevant compensation system, and ensuring that the contract is passed to the relevant person for requesting the options etc. ( I know that it used to be Mary McKendree, so I am copying Pam on this message).
 
 Regards
 
 Melissa
