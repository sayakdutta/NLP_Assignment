        As you probably guessed, Stan and I will not be coming to the Christmas Party after all.  I will try to get to Omaha prior to the Party for a couple of days though.

 Dan - We would like to invite you and your wife to our Christmas party December 7 at the Western Heritage Museum in Omaha.  This year, we are having a combined ETS & NBPL party with the social hour starting at 6:30, dinner at 7:30 followed by service awards program.  Bill Cordes is inviting Stan and if it works out that you could get a company plane, we would then ask Rod Hayslett, Shelley, and possibly Phil Lowry depending on seats available.
 
 All of us would love to have you attend.  Let us know at your convenience.
 
 Mike McGowan
