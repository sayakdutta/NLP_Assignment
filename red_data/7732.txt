 series of operations/controls reviews of Enron offices or certain companies 
 in which Enron holds an ownership interest.   Attached is a copy of that 
 schedule.  Please contact Ted or me if you have any questions.  You will note 
 that the full make-up of the teams is being worked on currently.  We have 
 identified the lead on each review, however, from RAC, Operations and AA.
