 our local counsel in Mississippi for their input insofar as the questions 
 involve capacity to contract.
 
 You'll be pleased to know that I understood his questions.  I'm so proud.

 Kay,  just thought I'd check to see how things are progressing.  The only one 
 I have heard from is Ed Sacks.  He has some good issues that I cannot 
 answer.  I asked him to be available Thursday and think about how he'd like 
 to see the structure work from a credit perspective.
 
 Have the Master Gas and Power agreements been forwarded to MDEA, et. al.??
 
 Thanks,
 
 Reagan
