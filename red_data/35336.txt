 
 I need to look and see what I have.  But first, you are not going with some 
 boys are you???
 
 I have a really cheap sleeping bag, some collaspable water bottles, all sorts 
 of small cooler type things, OHOHOH, I have a "wet seal" bag that you could 
 put some goodies in to keep them dry.  
 
 Do you need fishing stuff?
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
    
 Chris, I need your help.  Do you have any camping materials (sleeping bag, 
 backpack, canteen)  I am going camping with some friends this weekend and my 
 dad has always supplied me with the goods.  I'm at a loss, can you help or 
 know anyone who can?
