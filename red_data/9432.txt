 intercompany balances were relatively low (EES and ENA), with an increase i=
 n=20
 October with Enron Europe.  Do you have details behind this?  Are EES=20
 balances gas only, or gas and power?  How do we have imbalances with=20
 ourselves?  What kind of reporting do you get from financial ops on a regul=
 ar=20
 basis that gives you the details behind this?  I am assuming that these=20
 imbalances are created from commodity transactions, so that we would really=
 =20
 be closer to the details than would financial ops.  Is that a good=20
 assumption?  --Sally=20

 Please find attached the intercompany imbalance analysis for Enron Corp. an=
 d=20
 its subsidiaries for the accounting month of October 1999.
 
 Please note that intercompany imbalances are extremely significant this=20
 month. This is due primarily to various issues surrounding the London group=
 's=20
 first close on its new general ledger system.  The majority of these=20
 imbalances are expected to be resolved with November close and the remainin=
 g=20
 imbalances should be cleared by year-end.  Because of the abnormal spike in=
 =20
 all trends due to these issues, we have elected to keep the graphs in the=
 =20
 same scale as previous months rather than scale to fit this month=01,s numb=
 ers.=20
 This continues to allow for legibility of the other months=01, and other=20
 business units=01, trends.
 
 Please call me at extension 37659 if you have any questions.
