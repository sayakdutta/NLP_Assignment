 I spoke with Legg Madson's lawyer today.  He said that his complaint was
 done in haste and that he had not really thought everything through yet.  He
 said he would be glad to consider any written or oral showing we may wish to
 offer as to why ECT should not be in the suit.  (I made a brief pitch about
 why would we invest $30m just to get $750K as a fee for defrauding
 ourselves.  The lawyer seemed to understand.)  Richard, we should now decide
 how to proceed.  I would suggest a phone call with Legg Mason's counsel that
 you participate in, going over the facts and offering to supply documents to
 support what we say.
 
 Lisa, could you fax me a copy of the signed agreement with Oaktree in which
 ECT/Enron agreed to some continuing cooperation with Oaktree in the
 litigation.  Mike Swartz is calling us about that
