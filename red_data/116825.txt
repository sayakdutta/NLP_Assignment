 
 These deals were entered to flatten out the traders' positions in the PX. You 
 shouldn't see the index being used on any deals past tomorrow (the exchange 
 closes effective Feb. 1), but Bob Badeer and Matt Motley both had positions 
 they needed to back out of. They turned around and bought the same amount at 
 the Dow Jones index. Hope this helps!

 Ditto.  These two are priced against the PX index also.
 
 Thanks!

 This deal lis entered against the PX index.  We have been told by Chris 
 Foster that this index is going away.  Can you check and see if this is the 
 correct index?
 
 Thanks!
