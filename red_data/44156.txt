 So, would you advise terminating the 10/1/00 agreement effective 3/1/01?  If 
 the answer is yes, would we need to send out an letter advising of our 
 actions?

 Bridgette,
  I would stay with the April 1, 1998 agreement.  The 10/01/00 agreement was 
 with the canadian el paso entity.

 Dan,
 
 I have yet another El Paso question.  We currently have two masters with El 
 Paso Merchant Energy, L.P..  As you are probably aware, they have gone 
 through several name changes.  We need to know which master to keep 
 especially for EOL purposes.  Please advise.
