 Trey - Where did the $1.1MM New Albany loss end up?  I booked it to the management summary pc that you gave me, but I didn't know if it got reclassed to Presto or not.  thanks!

 Stacey,
 
 Georganne mentioned that you thought we may have booked a reserve for this back when you were unwinding the deals.  We did not. 
 
 Do we need to get together to discuss this?
