 Tori,
 
 What we'll have to do is to move those products which are in the restricted 
 product types to the regular product types.  Then I will set the restricted 
 product types to archived. We will need to coordinate as to when you want to 
 do this.
 
 Thanks,

 hey melba -- guess what -- we have come to the point where we no longer need 
 to make blanco a restricted product.  can we go ahead and change these ep 
 blanco avg products - both the fixed and index - back to normal unrestricted 
 products?  let me know...
