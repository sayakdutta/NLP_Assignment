 PG&E want to fight the TURN accounting as it, basically, wiped out hopes of 
 collecting their undercollected amount from a regulatory accounting 
 perspective.   The company has said they need to keep the old accounting 
 convention alive, as it would bolster their chance for recovery in the 
 litigation on the just and reasonable argument in Federal District Court.
 
 
 
  
     
 Can either of you help me get Jim an answer?

 Monday, May 14 PG&E asked the Court to stay the PUC's March 27 Order on 
 accounting procedures.  Where is this going?  This would be very bad.
