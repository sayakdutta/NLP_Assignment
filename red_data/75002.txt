 transaction, and it will be easy to "de-westify" it.

 Can't we send them a redacted copy of the LLC agreement used with Intergen?

 Carlos,
 
 I am working with NorthWestern in a negotiation similar to the Panda or Delta 
 deal regarding the placement of a turbine.  NorthWestern has requested a 
 draft of what the amended LLC document will look like, in particular, what 
 rights and control will Enron have?  I would appreciate if you could send me 
 a draft that I can forward to NorthWestern to further our negotiations.  We 
 are working on an expedited schedule and would appreciate a quick response.  
 Please advise when the document will be ready.
 
 Thanks
 
 Chris
