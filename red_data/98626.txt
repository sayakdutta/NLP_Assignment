 Sheila and Karen,
 
 As you requested, our accounting department has not been following up on our
 outstanding invoices -- which at this point total about $700,000 (see
 attached).  Sheila, I gather you told Barry you would try to get us current
 before the end of November.  That would be great if you can do it.  (I can
 give you wire info if you need it.)  If we don't make November (I know
 you're swamped!), December would be OK, but it is very important to us that
 we get caught up by year end.  Let me or Barry know if there's anything we
 need to do.
