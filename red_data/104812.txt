 Dear Sara:  I talked to Ofelia this afternoon and she said she'll be happy to 
 make the change between us.  Therefore, she'll go to your house this 
 Wednesday, Dec. 6.  She did want me to tell you, though, that she'll arrive a 
 little later than usual because she has to get some kind of a lab test early 
 in the morning.
 
 It's always a good day when Ofelia comes over!
 
 Regards,
 Mary
