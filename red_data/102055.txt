 
 Here is the draft for distribution.  In addition to the customer-friendly 
 "looking forward to meeting with our business partners" language I know 
 you'll include, I'd suggest including something like the following:
 
 Attached are drafts of the proposed tariff provisions (including the form of 
 Transport Option Amendment) and a filing letter.  We are providing these 
 draft documents to you in advance of filing them with FERC as part of a 
 good-faith effort to resolve any remaining issues with our shippers prior to 
 filing.  The drafts are for purposes of discussion by workshop attendees 
 only, and we ask that you not distribute them to persons outside your 
 company.  Additionally, while we hope that these drafts are close to being in 
 final form, they are of course subject to revision and final management 
 approval prior to filing with the Commission.
