 
 Hi Melba,
 
 Will you please create a new product that reads as follows:
 
 The interconnection between Alliance Pipeline Company and Vector Pipeline 
 Company located in Will County, Illinois.
 
 I also would like a NGPL Nicor product set up that uses the Gas Daily Posting 
 for "Chicago LDC-Large end-users" midpoint.
 
 I will need to have the Vector Alliance set up for tomorrow if possible.
 
 Thanks Melba!
