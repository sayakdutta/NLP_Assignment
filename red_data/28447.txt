 
 Is the difference between the first two cases and the second two cases the 
 higher 775 lb suction pressure that we hope we could get from pigging the 
 line?  If so, does this email say anything about whether we could get 
 10,000mmbtu/d to the Cal. border assuming the pigging successfully gets us to 
 775 lbs?  Lets talk to McShane tomorrow.  Thanks.. DF

 Drew, the information below is the same as Terry Galassinni gave me.  It 
 looks though as the HP is still short, but I maybe reading it wrong.

 The following is information requested by Terry Galassini:
 
 Operating Points 1A and 1B have a 750 Psig line inlet pressure and differ 
 only in gas suction temperature, 75 Degrees F for 1A and 80 Degrees F for 
 1B.  Both conditions can operate with the current wheel at Gallup; however, 
 Rolls would have to agree to a faster spin of the current compressor wheel as 
 explained in the cases.  Without approval from Rolls, a new aero, $125,000, 
 would be required.The motor horsepower is the crital component.  Mr 
 Eisenstein will have to comment on motor capability.
  
 Operating Point #1A
 
 750 Psig - Line Suction Pressure
 75 Degrees F - Gas Suction Temperature
 970 Psig - Line Discharge Pressure
 850 MMcfd - Compressed Volume
 
 Head = 12,442 Feet

 Maximum Design is 120 Ft/Sec
 Gallup Test Had 4 Points at or Above 102 Ft/Sec w/No vibration or Noise 
 Problems.
 
 The second is to purchase a new aero assembly, $125,000 and 20 - 24 weeks 
 lead time.  A new aero would probably spin a little slower than the 9,625 Rpm 
 suggested above.  This would put more emphasis on motor horsepower at a speed 
 less than 1,528 as calculated above.  Again, Mr. Eisenstein would have to 
 comment on motor capability.
 
 
 Operating Point #1B
 
 750 Psig - Line Suction Pressure
 80 Degrees F - Gas Suction Temperature
 970 Psig - Line Discharge Pressure
 850 MMcfd - Compressed Volume
 
 Head = 12,604 Feet

 Maximum Design is 120 Ft/Sec
 Gallup Test Had 4 Points at or Above 103 Ft/Sec w/No vibration or Noise 
 Problems.
 
 The second is to purchase a new aero assembly, $125,000 and 20 - 24 weeks 
 lead time.  A new aero would probably spin a little slower than the 9,675 Rpm 
 suggested above.  This would put more emphasis on motor horsepower at a speed 
 less than 1,536 as calculated above.  Mr. Eisenstein would have to comment on 
 motor capability.
 
 
 Operating Points 2A and 2B have a 775 Psig line inlet pressure and differ 
 only in gas suction temperature, 75 Degrees F for 2A and 80 Degrees F for 
 2B.  Both conditions can operate with the current wheel at Gallup at the 
 current speed limit.  Whether or not the current motor at the site is capable 
 of meeting the 2A and 2B conditions without modifications is left up to Mr. 
 Eisenstein.  
 
 Operating Point #2A
 
 775 Psig - Line Suction Pressure
 75 Degrees F - Gas Suction Temperature
 970 Psig - Line Discharge Pressure
 850 MMcfd - Compressed Volume
 
 Head = 10,841 Feet

 Maximum Design is 120 Ft/Sec
 Gallup Test Had 4 Points at or Above 99 Ft/Sec w/No vibration or Noise 
 Problems.
 
 
 Operating Point #2B
 
 775 Psig - Line Suction Pressure
 80 Degrees F - Gas Suction Temperature
 970 Psig - Line Discharge Pressure
 850 MMcfd - Compressed Volume
 
 Head = 10,984 Feet

 Maximum Design is 120 Ft/Sec
 Gallup Test Had 4 Points at or Above 100 Ft/Sec w/No vibration or Noise 
 Problems.
