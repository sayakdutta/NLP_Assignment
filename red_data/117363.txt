 Hi Mark-
 
 We have received the red-lined ISDA schedule from IBJ, with some additional=

 comments/questions.  They are looking to have a response prior to the "US=
 =20
 holiday".  As you will see below, I said we'll try.
 
 Thanks,
 
 John

 Dear Mr.Viverito
 
 Attached Word file is ISDA draft amended by our legal desk.
 (please take the amended points as our comment on your draft)
 Please check it all and kindly reply ASAP.
 (CSA is not acceptable as I mentioned you before, and we'll check your
 LETTER OF CREDIT after
 the schedule is almost agreed)
 
 In your draft, we cannot understand the meaning of "EDGAR" on page4,
 so please show us what it is.
 
 We are very hoping to conclude this process rapidly.
 So, I very much appreciate it if you could send back your comment before
 Holiday in U.S.(4th Sep)
 (it's ok if only the rough prospects of concluding ISDA)
 
 Best regards,
 Konishi IBJ Tokyo
