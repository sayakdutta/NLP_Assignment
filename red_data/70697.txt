 My suggestion is that you capture the change order with change order #1 for 
 PSCO's break out contract.  If it needs to be paid before year end (which it 
 probably does) you can put a payment date of December 20th, and it will be 
 paid out of TurboPark.  This approach has been discussed with Lee Johnson at 
 GE, and he is fine with it.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
