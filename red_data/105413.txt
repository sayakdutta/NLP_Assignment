 Pursuant to our recent conversation, I have attached below a DRAFT of ENA's 
 standard (1) municipal ISDA Schedule and (2) Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit 
 Support Annex.  These two documents are intended to supplement the 
 boilerplate for the ISDA Master Agreement and the ISDA Credit Support Annex.  
 The forms are generic, that is, they have not been tailored for use by a 
 specific municipal counterparty; they would necessarily be the subject of 
 specific negotiations.  
 
 Energy New England's agency relationship with the various municipalities 
 appears to cover physical trading.  Notwithstanding the agency agreement, the 
 financial trading world requires much more specificity, including but not 
 limited to, evidence of authority to execute a master financial agreement and 
 transactions thereunder.  Additional information, including a legal opinion, 
 is also required.  
 
 I assume from our prior conversation that you already have in your possession 
 copies of the ISDA boilerplate.  Please advise otherwise.
 
 You should feel free to contact Ed Sacks with questions regarding collateral 
 support documentation.  As I mentioned, the attached Paragraph 13 has not 
 been customized.
 
 Please feel free to call if you have any questions.
 
 Sara
