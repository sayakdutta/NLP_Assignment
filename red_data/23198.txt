 
 I have notified the Southwestern Legal Foundation that I will not be able to attend the November 2 meeting.  
 
  
     
 Do you still want to make the trip to Dallas for the Southwestern Legal Foundation on Friday, November 2?
 
 Travel to Austin for Trustees mtg. on the nights of Thursday, November 8, 9, 10 and checkout on 11th?
