 We will meet on 9/18/00 at 2:00 pm in 4262 to discuss Risk Management Policy.
 
 Lee, if you and your staff would like to come, please join in on the fun.
 
 Tony has agreed to move the Policy forward to the next level.  I summarize 
 some of the key information below.
 
 The current policy is too restrictive.
 
 We need to better define the type of transactions and who has authority to 
 execute and manage. 
 
 Do not include procedures and only discuss policy much like the Corporate 
 Risk Management Policy.
 
 Positions will be managed in a portfolio of Gas Commodity positions, however 
 not all positions are included in the position limits measurement for this 
 policy.  For example the pipelines are long capacity and this can be managed 
 in a portfolio without a limit requirement.  Also, TW is long over-retained 
 gas and this is a position which does not have to be part of our risk 
 management limits.  These positions were created by building a pipeline or 
 entering into transport service agreements and seperated approval guidelines 
 apply.
 
 North American Natural Gas is the only Commodity Group approved.  
 
 Transport Service Agreements are approved in accordance with ET&S policy #1 
 and #2.
 
 Financial Risk Management Agreements are approved within the guidelines of 
 this policy.  Financial Risk Management Agreements that create risk are 
 allowed by the Corporate Policy but not allowed by the ET&S draft policy.  We 
 need to think about limits on the creation of risk from Financial Risk 
 Management agreements.
