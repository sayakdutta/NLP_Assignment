 
 Frank,
 
 This guy called me because he read the book I wrote about Natural Gas.  He 
 has some kind of special treatment with the federal government in terms of 
 gas purchases.  Sounds like a minority owned business to me.  Could you call 
 him or refer him to someone at EES?  Thanks,  Fletch Sturm
