 Dear all interested volunteer tutors,
 
 There will be an informational meeting on Tuesday September 19th at
 5:30pm. This will be a brief meeting to discuss the tutor program and to
 match tutors with students in subject areas. The meeting will be here at
 the Houston Ballet Academy in the large conference room.
 
 So far we have students who will need tutors in the subjects of:
 art, sociology, spanish, geometry, english, earth science, history
 (government and world history), women's literature, and algebra II.
 
 Please let me know if you will be able to attend the meeting, as well as
 what subject area that you would like to tutor in. If you will not be
 able to attend the meeting, but are still interested in being a tutor
 please let me know as soon as possible.
 
 The Houston Ballet is located at 1921 W. Bell. The Houston Ballet
 Academy faces W. Grey and is inbetween Waugh and Shepherd (next to
 Kroger). If you need specific directions please call 713.523.6300. You

 Thank you for your interest and I look forward to meeting you.
