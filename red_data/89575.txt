 I know you have been talking with Mike but would you let me know what you have for August. 
 I took a quick look at the file and it looks like we (EES) are NP: long 297 (296 fixed 1 index) on peak and 86 (85 fixed 1 index) 
                                                                                                                   SP: Long 562 (587 fixed Short 25 indexon peak) on peak and long 341 off peak 
 Thanks
