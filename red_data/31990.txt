 I just spoke with Jim Scabareti at AGL regarding the releases of capacity.  
 AGL/VNG is fine with your proposal to release the assets for three years 
 provided the releases are recallable for any reason.  This recall right is 
 consistent with our asset management agreement (which basically determines 
 the nature of recall rights AGL has under our deal)
 
 So....
 
 Go ahead and release the assets, 100% recallable, for three years.
