 
 Deb,
 
 Could you please check with the state of incorporation (I believe Delaware) 
 and the Corp Secretary's office to see if the papers have been processed in 
 both places?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay

 I received the name change document and it has been executed on behalf of 
 Peoples and Enron.  I have also received and returned some state (IL) 
 registration documents from you and Lillian Bailey.  
 
 My understanding is that we have done everything we need to do to effect the 
 entity name change to enovate, L.L.C.  Kay Mann is trying to follow up and 
 confirm that all of the proper paperwork is in place.
 
 Please let me know if there is anything further I can do to facilitate the 
 process.
 
 thanks,
 Russell
