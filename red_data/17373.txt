 As of yet, I have not yet received your completed lobbying questionnaire.  If 
 it is in the mail, please disregard this message.  If it is not in the mail, 
 please fill out the questionnaire as soon as possible and return to me via 
 email or interoffice mail so that we can be in compliance with Federal income 
 tax laws.  If you did not engage in lobbying activity in 2000, a short email 
 to that effect is sufficient.  Many thanks for your cooperation.
