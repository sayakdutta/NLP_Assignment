 This is a desk-to-desk deal.  You need to get with the scheduler on the East 
 Desk who handles Transco.  Both desks will need to tie in MOPS.  In this 
 case, POPS most  likely tried to update the HPL side, but the East Desk has 
 not adjusted their side in MOPS.

 I have an error for Transco Bammel for that 20.0/day on days 23 through 27 - 
 do you change the volumes as they are sent back?  
 
 The volumes are:
 
 23     133
 24     20783
 25     20738
 26     20787
 27     20123
 
 Thanks!
 
 Charlotte
