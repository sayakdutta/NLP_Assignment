 Ok - I got home at 7 - made a full dinner (chicken, mashies, arties),
 watered all of your new plantings, roughed up your father in a little ping
 pong, and then went on a search and destroy mission for those damn frogs.
 We got 'em too!   They were two eensy little things that made the most noise
 you could imagine - however they are now in "frog" heaven!
 
 Again - I cannot thank you enough for all the help/work/beautification
 projects you guys did over the weekend - what would I do without you???
