 My parents are in town for Laura McHenry's wedding this weekend.  They want
 to invite you and Megan for tennis and lunch at the raquet club on Sunday.
 My dad and I can beat you and my mom, while Megan teaches Susan the basics.
 
 
 Let me know when you need a CPN lifeboat to come rescue you from the sinking
 ship.....
