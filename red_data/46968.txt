 
 Bob,
 
 In order to be able to draft the Aquila assignments below, I am going to need 
 the contract list which shows the contracts the  trades were originally under 
 and which contract they will be under when we assign them.   Can you for that 
 list to me ASAP so I can get started drafting the assignments.  It make take 
 some time.  Thanks!
