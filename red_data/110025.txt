 
 Marlo,
 
 As discussed, I am forwarding to you two spreadsheets with the requested 
 information.  Each spreadsheets are identified by month.  Within each 
 spreadsheet are a number of tabs.  Based on the customers you mentioned on 
 the phone, I believe you need only to use the "OCCMarkets" tab.  Customers 
 are along the horizontal with dates on the vertical.  For each customer, 
 several columns are used to identify the gas supplied to the customer from 
 each location.  Please call if you have any further questions.
