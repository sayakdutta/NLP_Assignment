 OK Cousins (and family):
  Here is the address for the newest most exciting site on the Internet
 (Well, we hope it will become exciting)  It all depends on You All.  I've
 registered the domain name "Thats-nice.com"  I tried to get "Thatsnice.com"
 but it was already taken.  It leads to a non-public page so be careful when
 typing the URL (Universal Resource Locater). Type it as
 http://www.thats-nice.com and you should get there OK.  Ronnie had trouble
 getting it right through her aol browser.  It finally worked by launching
 Explorer and entering the URL there.  How's that for a novice (only had
 computer three days)?
  It's now up to all of you to send me information and pictures to put on the
 page.  We need to keep it a "World Class" psite, so I reserve the right to
 discard objectionable material.  Objectional may be defined as anti-white,
 anti-black, anti-asian, anti-male, anti-female, anti-pro-life,
 anti-pro-choice, anti-gay, anti semitic, anti-yankee, anti-rebel,
 anti-blonde, anti-brunette, anti-redhead, anti-democrat, anti republican..
 or obscene materials. (well maybe not anti-republican).  You get the idea.
  Lets just not put anything on here that may be offensive to others in the
 group.
  I just checked to seewhat happens when mail is sent to anyone



 stuff up on the site within a few days.
 
  Please add to the mailing list:


 
 Hope this finds you all in good health.
