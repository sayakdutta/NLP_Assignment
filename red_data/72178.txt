 Chris, prior to our call this afternoon, I wanted to alert you to one term
 that was discussed in our Monday telephone call that I inadvertently left
 out of the letter you received yesterday.  Specifically, we would want the
 Enron carry to continue until September 1, 2001.  Thus, Northwestern would
 be obligated to close on the transaction (and get Enron its money) on or
 before this date.  Again, this specific term was discussed in the Monday
 call and left out of the letter.  I apologize for the oversight.  Let me
 know if this is a problem.
