 
 Chris,
 
 E hired Tony to support Global Markets but Jeff Shankman decided that, given
 highly specialized nature of his work it makes sense to put him in the
 Research Group, with a dotted line to Mike Roberts who is running our weather 
 group.
 
 Given that his work will directly and exclusively benefit GM, it makes sense 
 for Research to charge his expenses
 to Global Markets. We can adjust allocations to reflect his contributions to 
 different sub-units of GM.
 
 Tony spent the last few weeks in Houston training for his position in London 
 with Mike Roberts.
 We are very excited about the prospect of working with him.
 
 Vince

 Tony was hired to work for Global Markets.   Think costs should be assigned 
 to Vince or Mark but if you
 believe those costs should be for my group let me know.

 I now have Tony on one of my RCs (research).  I understand he will be doing 
 weather forecasts for some or all of you, and that he has a desk allocated in 
 Global.  I need to recharge his costs  - can someone please advise the right 
 cost centre.
 
 Many thanks,
 
 Tani
