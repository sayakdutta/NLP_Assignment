 
 Hill,
 
 Thanks for the invitation to serve as a Chairman of one of the sessions.
 Unfortunately, I may be receiving frequent calls from the office
 that might interfere with my  duties.
 
 See you next week.

 If you have not yet registered for the June 21-22 conference, please do so
 to help our planning and to obtain contact information for you.
 
 I want to remind you that recommended conference attire is business casual.
 
 If you do not have a Stanford parking permit (either by mail or at your
 hotel), please drive to the conference facility, park, and obtain one at
 the meeting room.  Detailed directions can be found on the website but here
 is a summary from Highway 101 North & South:
 
       Take the Embarcadero Road exit west toward Stanford. At El Camino
       Real, Embarcadero turns into Galvez Road as it enters the university.
 Stay
       in the left lane and continue toward the center of campus.  At the
 four-way
      stop, turn right onto Campus Drive.  Take first left (Lasuen Street)
 and drive
      to the end and park.  Conference site is at this building.  If you do
 not yet have
      a parking permit, we will give you one there.
 
 I look forward to a productive and interesting meeting.
 Hill
