 
 Paul:
 
 Just checking to see if you are the lawyer monitoring equity trading in the 
 U.K.  I am charged with the oversight of Gary Hickerson's equity activity 
 here in Houston and I want to coordinate with the London lawyer.  Please 
 advise.
 
 Also, I heard that you were recently married.  Congratulations!
