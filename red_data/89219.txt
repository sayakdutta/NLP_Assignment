 Great,
 
 I drive a 93 Honda Accord that is sort of Purple, so be on the lookout. I
 will pick both of you up at 12:00 on Friday the 17th for lunch at Irma's on
 me. I will pick you up in front of Enron where they usually have that lunch
 party event, or in other words, the side street that has the cathedral on
 the opposite side facing the Enron building.
 
 Looking forward to lunch,
 
 Majed
 
 
     
 That sounds good.  We'll see you at 12 on Friday.

     Dear Debra and Gerald,
 
    Lunch at 12:00 on Friday would be great. I was thinking that I could
    pick
    you guys up in front of Enron and then we could go to Irmas in
    downtown(they
    have valet parking). It may take a little over an hour to have lunch,
 so
    if
    your schedules for Friday are too busy, then we can go to Ninfa's or
    Treebairds. Looking forward to having lunch.
 
    Best Regards,
 
    Majed Nachawati

        Dear Debra,
 
       I want you to know that I am truly sorry for not meeting you for
    lunch.
       I
       feel so bad. I am in Dallas right now visiting family. I was
       interviewing
       for jobs in Atlanta last weekend. Anyway, I will be back in town
 on
       Thursday
       of this week. Friday lunch would work great for me, just let me
 know.
    I
       want
       you to fill me in on how you have been.
 
       Your law clerk,
 
       Majed Nachawati
       
                             
 
        Mr. Nemec and I were wondering when you might make a time
 available
    for
       us in your impressive schedule for LUNCH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Any day
 but
       Thursday  next week is good for me. Take care, let us know.
