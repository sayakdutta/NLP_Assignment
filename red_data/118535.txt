 solution last year to the "cat climbing the Christmas tree" problem except 
 fastening the glass ornaments really tight so when she climbed up inside the 
 tree they didn't shake off.  This year she seems content to just hide 
 underneath the tree and hasn't been climbing up inside it - maybe she's just 
 gotten too big.  I agree that the mouse traps sound mean - what about 
 double-sided tape?  I understand the cats hate stepping on the sticky stuff 
 so will leave the area alone afterwards (this was suggested as a 
 discouragement to jumping on kitchen countertops but might work under the 
 tree).  And of course, the lower branches of the tree are reserved for wooden 
 and metal ornaments - nothing breakable.  
 
 
 
 

    
 
 
 Christmas is coming again, and in reviewing our mail, I came across your
 "problem".  Did you come up with any solution?? A friend of ours (non-cat
 owner) suggested putting mouse traps under the tree - a couple of paw snaps
 and maybe no more??  Sounded cruel to me, especially for my oldest cat (13
 years).
      We have used pepper in some cases in the garden, but in the house, this
 would probably be more damaging to the humans than our 4 footed friends :-)
      If you have had any luck last year, please let us know, and we can post
 it on our web page which we are revising.  Others would find it interesting
 and perhaps amusing as well.
      Looking forward to seeing you again this Christmas,
                Peter from Ticonderoga Farms
