 	Do Steve and I need to come up and sit down with you and Mark and come to a resolution that
 	works for everyone?  Just let us know how you would like to handle.  Thanks for all your help.

 In meeting with Tom Gesell this morning, it was suggested that we take a half hour or so in Kansas City to discuss communication issues surrounding the implementing of allocations and/or flow controls.

 Gas Control we need to call  Mid Am by around 5:45 P.M. (Intra day 2 process) to see what their intention are on Quad Cities and Cedar Rapids points if they are outside their 20,000 plus 5% of their order. ETS scheduler should call you around this time to see if we need to allocate them based on the information they have given you. Also be sure and log this conversation.
