 
 I have been able to move up the meeting with Mark Frevert regarding 
 responsibility for operations for ENA, EGM and EEL to Thursday, August 17 
 instead of August 28.   I will keep you posted.  
 
 I met with Brent's direct reports yesterday afternoon and announced Brent's 
 new role.  I will have three persons leading the natural gas team:  Steve 
 Jackson, Leslie Reeves and Bob Hall.  I am confident that this will work 
 well.
