 
 Patti,
 
 It was good to see you and Mike last night. 
 
 I wanted to follow up on the MS150 - I can assure you that you will do fine 
 without training (assuming, of course, that you have a bike).  I did it that 
 way twice before with no major complications.  Given your running, you will 
 do better.  It really is a lot of fun.
 
 Sherri is checking to see if you can join the Enron team.  We will be the 
 first team off on Saturday morning and the team has good facilities (tents, 
 food, etc.) that improve the experience.  GO FOR IT!!
 
 Jeff
 
 PS - hi, Patti - this is Sherri.  I did check with our team captain and she 
 said you could join our team so long as you do so by Friday.  She is going to 
 e-mail all the necessary forms and information to me, which I will forward to 
 you today if you are interested.  Let us know!  Hope all is well...
