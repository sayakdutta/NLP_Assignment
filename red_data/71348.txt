 Hi there,
 
 I'm attaching the final forms of the assignment/assumption agreements for 
 GE's acknowledgement.  It is pretty close to what you saw last week.  It 
 would be a big help if we could have these executed  by GE today or 
 tomorrow.  A faxed signature would work, then we could have the originals 
 picked up from Lee's office.
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
