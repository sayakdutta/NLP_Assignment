 information, other than curiosity.

 Presumably this will work?  Additionally, we should be able to apply this 
 same model to Brownsville, though they didn't mention it.
 
 Thoughts?

 Mitch:
 
 This E-mail is a follow-up to our telephone discussion today. With regard to
 providing copies of the Gleason and Wheatland contracts to Allegheny,
 Siemens Westinghouse proposes the following:
 
 1.  Siemens Westinghouse will prepare and forward to Enron electronically
 our standard confidentiality agreement addressed to Allegheny.
 
 2.  Once the confidentiality agreement has been executed, Siemens
 Westinghouse will forward the PDP files (we believe that these agreements
 are executed) to Enron.  We will redact the pricing information and the
 liquidated damages provisions. If the agreements are not signed, we will
 provide the signature pages under separate cover.
 
 If this is not satisfactory, please let me know.
