 
 I slept great.
 
  
     
 funny......I had sent this one out earlier today (got it from Jimmy  
 Aguilera's sister....remember him....lives in Pueblo)....anyway then I also  
 sent it to Toni Sturm so she must have sent it to Fletch huh?  
 love ya..........I didn't get much sleep last night....how about you?  you  
 probably slept like a cat huh?
