 
 Hello Mr. Temple,
 
 This is a follow-up email to what you talked with Dave Allan on the subject of Fiber morphology. Attached you will find the fiber characteristics spreadsheet - the most updated version. 
 
 We also have an additional question which is - why each quality parameter (the column headings) is important to each major end-use (paper grade) application.
 
 You can contact me for any further questions.
 
 
 thanks,
 Monika Causholli
