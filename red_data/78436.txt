 Will do!  I KNOW it's not a vacation day my dear!  Jacoby has called me I 
 don't know how many times asking for your numbers.  I need a drink!  It's 
 been one busy day for me too!

 Could you PLEASE PLEASE call David Marshall and get his email?  I'm on 
 endless conference calls and need to contact him about a matter.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
 
 PS, not a vacation day
