  July 20th we will celebrate Shirley's birthday therefore I asked her
 if she would mind if I ordered lunch for the staff meeting whereby she
 can relax during that  time period. (without pressure to get the lunch ready)
 
 On July 20th I would like too  have a different caterer for our lunch ,they 
 will basically
 serve the same menu with a different style hopefully the group will enjoy
 the meal.
 
 The menu will include : assorted sandwiches
                                                          chips
                                                         soup
                                                      Iced Tea
                                                                               
                        (vegetarian sandwiches included)
 
 Please Vince, inform me if this is okay !
 
 
 
                       Thanks

 F.Y.I.       the price range is very close to what Marriott charges per person
