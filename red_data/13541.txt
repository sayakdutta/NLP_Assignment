 Michelle, I reviewed the Project Canary Asset Purchase and Sale Agreement and
 offer the following observations:
 
 In an asset transaction, where the buyer did not want to acquire or assume
 the employee benefit plans of the seller, I have always recommended to
 include such plans and liabilities in the statement of excluded assets.
 Based on the recitals for this transaction, and other provisions of the
 Agreement (Sections 7 and 10) it appears that the employee benefit plans are
 not excluded.
 
 Generally, when such employee benefit plans are included in an asset
 transaction, the buyer wants to obtain representations as to the funding,
 compliance and administration of the plans.  These kinds of representations
 are not in the Agreement.
 
 The bottom line is that the buyer needs to rely on Canadian counsel and
 actuaries to gives buyer the level of comfort it desires to have with respect
 to these issues of funding, compliance and administration so that they can be
 inserted into the financial model for determining the offering price.
 
 You may wish to obtain a formal opinion letter from the Canadian counsel and
 actuary regarding the level of comfort the buyer requires.
 
 
 Pat
