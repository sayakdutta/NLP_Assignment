 Mark,
 
 Could you please review the Disclosure Consent and Waiver Acknowledgement attached regarding release of our counterparties transaction data to CommodityLogic and let us know your comments.
 
 I will also forward the Data Services Agreement between EnronOnline and CommodityLogic.  I am aware that you were on Mark Greenberg's distribution list of October 30, but we want to make sure we have your comments to this agreement as well.
 
 Thank you.
