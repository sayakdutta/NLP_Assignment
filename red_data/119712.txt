 According to my contact at Sierra Pacific/Nevada Power, the deals you're doing with them should be with Nevada Power , not Sierra Pacific.  For Sept, the deal #s I see are 737918, 796406,and 1043833.  Is there any reason why we can't change the counterparty name in Sitara to Nevada Power?
 
 
 
 Thanks
