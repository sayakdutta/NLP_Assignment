 
 Jim:  After today's hearing, I think you're note is dead on.  Let's talk.  
 I'm in the office tomorrow.  Miss seeing you all in D.C.
 
 Best,
 Jeff

 Chris --
 
 Given this development, now may be the right time for Enron to come in and 
 make a "public" offer to SDG&E.  We may be able to put some pressure on the 
 CPUC to approve a full requirements offer that works with the legislative 
 rate cap.
 
 I'll be in contact with you to discuss.
 
 Jim
 
 
 
 

   
 Surprise, surprise.  
 
 SDG&E is afraid to do anything without the pre-approved reasonableness from 
 the CPUC which I don't think will be obtained.

 SDG&E would like to inform you that  we did not gain authority from the
 commission on 9/7 and cannot enter into bilateral trades at present; (2) we
 anticipate receiving that approval on September 21; we will solicit new
 proposals between now and then and look forward to your continuing
 participation, as well as your assistance in gaining the necessary
 regulatory approvals.  Thanks
