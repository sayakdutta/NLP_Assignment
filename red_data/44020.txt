 The East and Upstream Origination Group Chrismas lunch will be Wednesday, 
 December the 20.  I am trying to get an approximate count of all employees 
 who will be attending.  I realize this is short notice, but in order to make 
 reservations, please RSVP to me today.  You can contact me via reply e-mail, 
 or at extension 5-3317. Later today, I will send an e-mail with the details 
 of the event.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.  Regards, Keegan 
 Farrell
