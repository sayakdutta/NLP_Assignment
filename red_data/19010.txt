 
 Steve:  
 
 Attached is a memo that reponds to your question:  "Can the solution to the 
 utilities' undecollection problem take place at the PUC, or is a legislative 
 fix required?"  As we discussed, I'm also attaching a memo from Mike Day on 
 the issue.  
 
 Bottom line:  It's within the PUC's jurisdiction to solve the problem, but 
 the likelihood is high that it will be a key focus of the Legislature in the 
 next session.  If you, or anyone on the distribution, have any questions, let 
 me know.
 
 Best,
 Jeff
