 moved around and re-organized.
 
 
    
  
 Kay,
 
 I have gone through the first 37 pgs and landed on the Energy Mgmt Svcs Agmt 
 when it occured to me that I really could use an education on the contract 
 structure.  So I am backing up to outline the doc(s) to see how everything 
 fits.  Call me when you get a few minutes...I need a lesson.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Reagan
 
 
  
     
 Well, don't get too excited until you read it.  There's lots of stuff I just 
 had to put place holders on, but we'll get it all filled in.

 Wow!  This is big.....remarkable effort.
 
  
     
 Here's a starting point.  I've tried to bracket stuff with open issues like 
 this [ ], but I'm sure there are more questions than [ ]s.  I'm really 
 unclear on the financial aspect of the deal.

 Reagan, I didn't stop to put the exhibits you sent in, as I thought it was 
 better to get the doc in your hands (and Mr. Fairley's) for a detailed review.
