 Hi Sara and Sheila, 
 
 By way of update, I was able to get the guaranty to Clem and am working on 
 his getting it back to me by the end of the day.  I talked to Bear Stearn's 
 lawyer today about whether we could get the other agreements (account and 
 assignment) executed today and she represented that (1) she is still waiting 
 for her Managing Director's approval of her final draft in order to forward 
 it to me (2) but that she is working with me to check in with the MD every 
 hour or so for a status update.

 Wednesday, March 28 is the target execution date for the ECI customer 
 agreement and assignment (from ENA) of the Securities Loan Agreement/credit 
 book.  I am not certain if Cheryl was able to expedite delivery of the new 
 ENE guaranty.

 Tom,
 The day i received this I responded to Sara and cc'd richard that I was okay 
 with transferring the Stock Loan Agreement from ENA to ECI.  The ENA was 
 executed and the ECI piece is what is in process.  
 
 Sara,
 Any update?  How far are we away from exectution?  Do you need anything from 
 anyone?
 
 Thanks. Sheila

 Just wanted to follow up to see if we have a time frame as to when the letter 
 will be fully executed.
 
 Thanks,

 Here's a recap for everyone.  
 Our original negotiation with Bear (for the Securities Loan Agreement) was in 
 the name of ENA, and, ENA had an existing account agreement with Bear.  
 However, Bear insisted that the account agreement was "too old" and that we 
 negotiate a new agreement.  I agreed on the condition that this not hold up 
 execution of the Securities Loan Agreement.  We have one or two final points 
 remaining on the new account agreement which we'll execute for both ENA and 
 Enron Credit Inc.. ("ECI").  We have the authorized trader list for ECI and 
 are waiting for Richard to designate the new officer/director slate but we 
 are prepared for execution by the existing officers in London.  The 
 assignment instrument will be very short for transferring the ECI book from 
 ENA to ECI.  It will take only a few days to replace the existing ENE 
 guaranty for the Securities Loan Agreement.
 
 Jeff and Sheila:  Please verify that both ENA and ECI do not  need the 
 Securities Loan Agreement.  I believe it is just ECI and we can transfer the 
 existing agreement to ECI.

 Sara,
 
 I just spoke with Russ Miron from Bear Sterans regarding our Guaranty to 
 Reduce funding to 20% per side.
 
 I had asked him about when they will be executing the agreement.  He said 
 that his lawyers are ready to sign but are under the impression that you have 
 one remaining point to resolve and that this point is holding up the 
 finalization of the agreement.
 
 Is there an issue from our side?  If not we should be able to get this 
 execution taken care of immediately?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Tom
