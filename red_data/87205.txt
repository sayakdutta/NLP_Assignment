 Good Morning Bob and Happy Holidays to you -
 Hope things are going well with you and Enron North America ("ENA").
 Earlier this week, I assumed a new role at Constellation Power Source, Inc.,
 which will give the opportunity to "reconnect" with many of the contract
 administration and legal professionals I worked with during my years at
 MEGA. I look forward to working with you once again.
 
 In light of the upcoming addition to our wholesale energy business, this
 email confirms our request to establish a gas purchase and sale agreement
 between your organization and Constellation Power Source, Inc.("CPS").
 According to our business structure, our affiliate company in Houston, TX,
 Constellation Energy Source, Inc.("CES"), was previously handling all of the
 wholesale natural gas business on behalf of our organization.  It is
 expected that CES will cease operations by April '01 and the wholesale gas
 trading activity will be conducted through our newly formed Gas Desk located
 within the CPS' offices in Baltimore, MD. I have already contacted CES in an
 attempt to gather contracts and determine whether an assignment or the
 termination and reissuing of a new agreement between us would be the most
 feasible mean to proceed with our gas trading activity in a timely fashion.
 
 ENA  has been identified by our Gas Desk as one of the potential
 counterparties for gas trading in the year 2001.  CPS will initiate gas
 trading as early as January 29th, 2001. Considering this, I am looking
 forward to receiving a copy of your master agreement for our review and
 consideration.  Such can be forwarded to me via email at the earliest
 convenience.
 
 I thank you in advance for your assistance and prompt response to our
 request and look forward to working with you in the near future.  Do not
 hesitate to contact me if there are any further inquiries to this request.
 I will make a note to follow up with you during the first week of January
 '01.
 
 Regards,
 Vangie McGilloway
