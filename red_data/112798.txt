 Attached is a memo I prepared for Rick Shapiro and Jim Steffes regarding FERC's investigation into potential refunds for Pacific Northwest spot sales.  I'm circulating the memo in anticipation of questions during the conference call tomorrow.  Gary Fergus and/or Dan Watkiss will likely have further observations.
