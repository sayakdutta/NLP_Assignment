 
 Thanks.   Sounds like a solid no.
 
 
     
 
 So the scoop is He is Average.
 
 He recently moved out of Bandwidth 6 weeks ago and back into Continental Power trading - why he is moving again after 6 weeks.  Is it a problem with the business or him?
 
 He worked for Marcello Romano (Head of Bandwidth Trading in Europe) as John knows.  Marcello says he is a solid hard worker who has no edge.  If Marcello were to run UK Gas again he wouldn't take him - as he is not sharp.  So he wouldn't bother to move him across the Atlantic if it costs a lot.
 
 Your call.  Ring Marcello for more information.

 Louise - Do you know this gentleman from your days in London?   His resume looks good and he is interested in moving to Houston and working in East Power.
  
 John Suarez - You are going to need at least one and probably two solid cash/term traders for the SE region.   Talk to Seresh about this guy.

 thanks for taking a look at this. 
 I will talk to you in the next days to see if you think I will make enough money for you.
