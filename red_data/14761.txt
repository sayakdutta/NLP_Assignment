 
 I copied the children's church materials yesterday and will have Gaby drop them off at church tomorrow.
 
 We agreed to have a children's church meeting tacked on to the end of the next children's ministry meeting.
 
 Would you please check to see that VBS is penciled in July 22-26 on the church calendar.
 
 Thank you
 Shelley (making good use of my jury duty time)
