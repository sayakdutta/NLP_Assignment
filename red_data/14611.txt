While these have certainly been stressful times and a sad day for the many Enron employees that lost their jobs today, we have not had any workforce reductions in our area.  It's a little lonely in the building and I have to make sure to put my lipstick on before I go down to the lobby to face all the TV cameras camped out down there!
 
 
     
 
 Shelley-
 
 Just to let you know I am thinking if you.  Please let me know how you are
 doing.  Take care.
