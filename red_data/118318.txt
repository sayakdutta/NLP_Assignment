 Mark and Allison.  It is too ambitious to plan to translate this on Tuesday, 
 I think.  I need to work with you on the regulatory stuff.  I also will work 
 on the other pieces.  And most of this is missing.  Allison, do we have the 
 corporate structure pieces in place.  Do we have the financial stuff.  Yao is 
 on vacation I know, Mark.  How much time do you have?  I'm swamped but will 
 be in Brasil on Tuesday.

 Attached is the description of Enron's marketing business worldwide and 
 marketing plan for Brazil as supplemental information to be submitted with 
 Application to ANEEL to request authorization to trade electricity in Brazil. 
 Please make any comments you feel necessary by Monday evening so that I can 
 send out for translation Tuesday a.m.
 
 Mark, I will send all certificates and other information required under 
 Resolution 265 when I receive the completed list.
 
 Thank you,
 
 Allison
