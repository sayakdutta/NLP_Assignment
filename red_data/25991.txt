 FYI.  Anytime a purchase is done at an industrial point with a fixed price, the purchase should be kept whole.  Only the buybacks with Gas Daily pricing take the swings.
 
 
 
  
     
 Daren -
 Howard came by and asked me to check with you regarding deal 717768 starting 
 April 6th for 2,000 - it was created by you April 5th. . He wasn't sure if it was a buy back and if you wanted me to
 link the buy back deal to 692725. The buyback deal for this is normally 544392(when it was on meter 8216). Do you want
 this deal to act as the buy back or stay whole.  Thanks - Julie
