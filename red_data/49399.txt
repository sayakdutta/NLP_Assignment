 Just a quick note to say that I have now left the EPRM/Risk conference
 division after two and a half very happy years. I am however still at Risk
 Waters Group, where I am now working as a journalist on EPRM magazine.
 Future conference enquiries should go to Paul Bristow (US - 212 925 6990) or
 Frances Tully (Europe - +44 (0) 20 7484 9731).
 
 Many thanks for your work my events and I hope we can work together again in
 the future. If you have any ideas on the writing side then I would always
 appreciate a call or email - my contact details all remain the same.
 
 Best regards,
 
 Joel.
