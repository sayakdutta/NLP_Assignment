 Yes, you are absolutely correct, I can never get ahold of you.    I know you're very busy.  Our plane get in at 12:00 on Friday, so we'll  hail a cab over to Mom's house.  Everything here is going okay.  I hope Tina has had the baby by the time I get there this weekend.  I sure don't want her to have to spend Easter in the hospital.  As far as dinner is concerned, we'll have the regular, roast, ham, macaroni and cheese, greens yams, etc.  Mom said something about getting a turkey, if so, we'll have to have dressing.  Anyway, I think I am going to choir rehearsal tonight, so I'll try to call you on the way home.
 
 See ya!
