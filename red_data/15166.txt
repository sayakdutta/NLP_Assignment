 should be OK but I think we should look at changing some of your holdings.  I 
 looked and some of your funds haven't done so well this year especially Low 
 Priced Stock.  Also, I am worried about earnings for many companies with 
 energy prices so high and the prospect of very high prices this winter.  I 
 don't know but it might be prudent to even move some money into cash or up 
 your bond exposure.  I'll try to call you and talk about it later.  If I 
 don't talk to you in the next couple of days remind me and maybe we can look 
 at some options when you are here for the wedding.
