 EES - the ENA ones are still on hold.  I really am not concerned about EES and retail.  I spoke to Muller who was hesitant about providing load numbers as he thought it irrelevant.  There is very little left to carve out.

 Saw in the WSJ today that the judge allowed Enron to "end" 600-700 supply
 contracts. Is that EES? If so are they going to still be in business? I ask
 because of my question from yesterday re the annual load carve-out. Is there
 anything left to carve out??
 
 Thanks

 The following documents are the two agreements which facilitate the online
 trading.  These contracts govern the actual transaction process and are
 accepted the counterparty either in writing or electronically.
 Password Application	-  In writing
 Electronic Trading Agreement	- Electronically
 
 These documents do not have any customer specific terms (eg credit etc) as
 they are not intended to govern the underlying commodity transactions, but
 simply the utiliszation of the website.  The General Terms and Conditions
 will be issued to the known Buyer as they do have credit terms etc.
 
 Please let me, Dave Forster or Mark Taylor know if you would require further
 information.
