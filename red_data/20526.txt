 
 Thanks.  Love to catch up on Tuesday when I get back, if that works for you.
 
 Best,

 Hey Jeff
 Yep there were a lot of people.  The class seems a lot
 more like an undergrad class: lecture style, one small
 book,  only one exam-in class final, no name tags, no
 attendance monitoring. Lecture seems to VERY closely
 mirror the book. While the logistics look favorable
 from a time perspective, I'm not sure how promising it
 looks from a "wow" that was a great class perspective.
   
 
 Class held from 6:00 til 8:30 ish, w/ a 5 min break
 (we voted).
 Hope you're havin fun on vacation!  Let me know if
 you're going to go to this class, or want to catch up
 on Tues durng break-
 Courtney
