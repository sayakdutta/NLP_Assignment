 
 Angelika,
 
 Sorry for a short notice but unexpected is part of the
 corporate life. Zimin will cover both my presentation and
 the workshop - he is a very good speaker and I am sure
 he will do a better job that I could do.

 Thanks for letting me know. We regret that Vince Kaminski will not be able
 to make it, but I appreciate that there can always be unforeseen
 circumstances like this. I assume that he will not be able to attend the
 workshop, either - could you confirm this?
 
 Thank you for providing a replacement - I am looking forward to meeting Mr
 Lu in Paris. We will need his presentation tomorrow by 12, as the van will
 leave at 1 to go to Paris.
 
 Kind Regards,
 
 Angelika Staude

 Angelika:
 
 Unfortunately, Vince Kaminski will not be able to attend the conference
 in Paris next week due to unforseen circumstances here at Enron Houston.
 He will be sending Dr. Zimin Lu, Director, Enron Research to replace
 him.
 
 I will be sending Zimin's presentation to our London Office and they
 will get the copies to you sometime on Friday.  The Enron London Admin.
 who is handling this for us is Karin Ahamer and her phone number is
 44-207-783-4419.
 
 I will forward your original email attachments with the changes later
 this afternoon.  Let me know if you have any questions or I can help in
 any way.  Thanks.

 Shirley,
 
 Thank you for letting me know.
 
 Would you send the copies from the US or from your London office (which
 is
 just across the road from ours)? If you could get them to copy the
 presentation, that would be brilliant. If not, I think it is too
 complicated
 and too expensive for you to send them from the US. I would then try and
 take care of the copying myself (but would prefer not to, as it the run
 up
 to the conference is fairly frantic as it is...).
 
 Thank you for your help!
 
 Kind Regards,
 
 Angelika Staude
 
 
 
     
 
 Angelica:
 
 I apologize, but I spoke with Vince and he is unable to get his
 presentation to you as
 requested.  We will have to make copies and mail them.  Please let me
 know where to
 mail them.
 
 He will email you a copy as soon as he can.
 
 Regards,
