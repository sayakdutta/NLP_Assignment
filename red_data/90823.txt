 
 me too , arnold is out today so a little busy
 i love you honey
 
  
     
 Good morning to my sweet honey..
 Hope your day goes well...I really hope
 that I did not come across as insensitive in our 
 discussion to try to get the townhouse back in the
 event we get a contract on our lot, I just want what is best
 given the levels of stress we deal with day in and day out
 So- I would like to talk further about it- because if it makes sense
 to try and keep going on that new construction then maybe we should- I guess we would
 have "down time" while it was being built... just hope the lead on our
 lot comes through.
 love you
