 Greg,
 how are you?
 Enclosed find some pictures from our regular sunday-night-Stammtisch.
 Can you do me a favour and send me the email-adresses of James, Ben,
 Glen, Mark and Ulrich. I want to invide them for the celebration of the
 25th aniversary of the Stammtisch FKK. As you know this will happen from
 20th of july until 22th of july 2001. I hope we see you there.
 The email-adress on the top belongs to Hermann.
 Servus
