 
 Brant,  Attached are the Master Firm agreement that Debra prepared based on 
 your credit worksheet.  I removed the form of Guaranty since we use a 
 different form for the Bridgeline Holdings, L.P.   and I wasn't sure if we 
 would need a JV guaranty for any of these deals.  
 
 Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
