 
 Dear Mr. Trice,
 
 On behalf of Jeff Skilling, I am writing to thank you for the invitation to 
 the CAM gala on April 6.  Unfortunately, Jeff will be unable to join you as 
 he will traveling out of the country on that date.
 
 With regard to your second invitation to meet your business partner next 
 week, I regret to tell you that he is unable to accept the offer.  He will be 
 in So. America, and therefore, will not attend the GS conference in Aspen.
 
 Sincerely,
 Sherri Sera
 Assistant to Jeff Skilling

 Jeff,
 
 Two things:
 
 Would you like to join Liz and me at the Contemporary Arts Museum Gala,

 I would like to introduce you to my business partner, Clint Carlson in Aspen
 next week.  He is going to attend the Goldman Sachs Natural Gas conference
 March 18th - 21st .  Clint is the chief investment officer of our firm and
 is the portfolio manager for our relative value arbitrage strategy (pairs
