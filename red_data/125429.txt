 
 Stewart,
 
 It is my strong belief that Kiodex will be most successful in marketing to Fortune 500 corporations. These companies have extremely large portfolios of derivative products to hedge various financial risks but do not view running a risk management system internally as core. I am interested in your thoughts, and how, if you agree, we can influence the company in this direction.
