 Tracy -
 
 Would you happen to have the information EES is asking for? They need 1-3Q for 2000 throughput... see attached power point presentation below...
 
 Thanks!

 Kimberly:
 
 Attached is the info I need from you (the data on the far left - green graph) to update for the EES All Employee Meeting this Friday.  As I'm sure you are aware, this is an urgent request.
 
 I appreciate your prompt attention,
 Rana
