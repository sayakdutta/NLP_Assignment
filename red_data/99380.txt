 
 Whatever happened to this?
 
  
     
 We are considering this as a response to an allegation that Enron should consider itself responsible for Visual Bridge liabilities.
 
  

  
 Attached is an initial draft of a proposed response to the letter to Gene from Global Production.  It goes without saying that we need to make sure that the facts stated our consistent with our records.  It may very well say more than we want to say as well.  Nevertheless, with the view that it is easier to take out than add, I have restated some points.  In addition, since I think we may be sending something like this out to more than one VBI creditor, it may be worth setting up a format that we can re-use.  Anyway, please review and lets talk about the content and the timing of a response.
