          I apologize for the lateness of this notice, but we are offering
 our first "Econophysics" course this fall.  The course announcement from
 Joe McCauley is attached.  If there are any individuals there who might
 want to take or sit in on the course, they can do so as Post Bac. students
 with minimal complications...  We will have our Econophysics program web
 site up shortly, and I will send you the URL when that happens.
