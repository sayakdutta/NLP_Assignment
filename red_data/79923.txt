 I will be participating in the above program on September 12-13 and have been 
 asked to gather input from managers, direct reports and peers/colleagues.
 Keilty, Goldsmith & Company will send you a feedback packet on August 11th 
 and I ask that you take a few moments to complete and return the form.
 
 I appreciate your input.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Philippe
