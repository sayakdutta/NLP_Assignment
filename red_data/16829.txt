 ABX 1 passed out of the Senate Appropriations Committee moments ago on a
 vote of 7-2.  The bill received no Republican votes.  I have attached
 the amended version of the bill for your review.  The bill will be taken
 up on the Senate floor shortly, then will go back to the Assembly for
 concurrence this afternoon.
