 
 As a result of restructuring out-of-the-money transactions with BP Capital 
 and T. Boon Pickens, we have a total of $9,530,935 in the Schedule C for the 
 NG Price book.  These values are negative in Schedule C, thus they are 
 positive value to the book.
 
 A total of $9,321,151 will be released out of Schedule C tonite (8/29/2000).  
 The remaining $209,784 will be relesed by the end of the week.  We are 
 awaiting word on whether or not this value will be needed for credit reserve.
 
 Thanks,
