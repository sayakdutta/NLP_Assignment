 
 How many times will I have to remind them? Mike Driscoll added comments on 
 both these deals - they would definitely like the special language added in 
 the confirm letter.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate

 Hi Kate!
 I have two deals that extent past April 2002 (Deal #478879 & #478878).  The 
 traders didn't enter any comments about special CAISO language to be 
 entered.  Will you ask them if they want us to enter that language?
 Thanks!
 Kim
