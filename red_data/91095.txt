 
 NYMEX fees are the same regardless of the Broker correct
 
  
     
 For a full round turn it would be as follows...
 
 Floor rate $2.50
 Clearing   $1.80
 NYMEX Fees  .80
 TOTAL:  $5.10
 
  
     
 So on the EDF Man acct if we executed and cleared throught them the total cost paid to EDF is  what ?
 with the Floor rate 1.25 & clearing 0.90
