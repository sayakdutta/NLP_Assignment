 
 I am pathetically and pathologically late in getting back to you.Sorry. Enron is very opposed to this. Can we talk at your convenience today.
 
  

  
 You received a memo last week from Kaye, Scholer recommending that a demand for arbitration be made immediately with respect to Edison.  As I explained, part of it would be a preemptive strike on the assumption that Edison is preparing an action against the participants.  At this stage, the recommendation is only to commence the arbitration, not to file a suit seeking prejudgment remedy of attachment.  I anticipate that the issue will come up for a vote during this Thursday's committee meeting.  What is your position?  Bob
