 Take a look at this.
 
 Note that this does not address capacity release issues.
 I think that might be too much for this letter.
 I think we should take that up separately.
 Probably, an ad hoc basis is best to start with.
 For example, I think we should work with Marc of FPU on an individual basis and see what happens.
 Then we would be able to feel more confident on whether to call a meeting on this or not.
