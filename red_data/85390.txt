 Bob Mustard from Tom Brown called me at 5:00 today to inquire as to my 
 understanding of the Wildhorse/Crescendo issues.  I explained to him the 
 situation in a nutshell and he told me that they thought they would have 
 completed the acquisition this week but should be finished next week.  He 
 asked if we were still interested in acquiring the Mesa system and I told him 
 that I thought we were interested in the gathering system and potentially 
 theTom Brown  reserves.  He said they are very interested in talking to us 
 about a deal on these properties and will forward a Confidentiality Agreement 
 to me tomorrow.  
 
 He also mentioned that there is a conference call tommorow at 11:00 A.M. 
 central time between Crescendo and Wildhorse.  Wildhorse has asked that Tom 
 Dyk and Pete Schere (Tom Brown execs) participate in that conference call.  
 Tom and Pete are not comfortable participating in that call given the 
 situation at hand.  Therefore, he asked if we could have Ken Krisa or someone 
 else postpone the meeting.
 
 Let's Discuss at your earliest possible convenience.
