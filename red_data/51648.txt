 I will sign an agreement not to use the materials
 
 

  
 
 
 Ian,
 
 Sorry for a delay in getting back to you.
 I have one challenge I did not anticipate
 when I talked to you  the first time about our Real Options
 internal seminar.
 
 The materials were prepared in collaboration with a professor
 from another school, and there is some  sensitivity regarding
 the intellectual property rights and the ability to distribute the
 materials
 outside Enron.
 
 Please, give me some time to find out if I can work
 around this issue.
 
 Vince

 I still have not heard from your lawyer.  I would like to see whar
 materials you are using and assess how we could work on the topic of real
 options with Enron
