 Sevil:  In order that we may proceed with your request for Permanent 
 Residency, our immigration attorneys have advised us that we need to process 
 the HIB visa, prior to the Permanent Residency application.
 
 Therefore, I am attaching an HIB visa questionnaire that I would like you to 
 complete and return to me, together with copies of all of the documents 
 listed at the bottom of the form.
 
 Please bring these to me in 3AC2026A.
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions at x55083.
 
 Thank you
 
 Margaret
