 
 (1)  I have to leave early this evening to pick up pets (about 5:45)
 
 (2)  Just a thought after seeing Shari's email:  would the paralegals and/or 
 lawyers benefit from the two seminars "Successful Working Relationships" 
 (valuing differences; creating understanding)?  Should this be mandatory with 
 some type of follow up to help improve group communication skills?
