 I hope you are doing well.  I just talked to Wende and we discussed having lunch with you on the 26th.  My flight isn't until 7 pm that day and I would love to see you.  I hope you will be able to make it!  My job search is going well.  I was in Denver yesterday and that looks promising.  I may just wait for the new deal here to go through to see what is still left with the "new company".  I am traveling Jan 3 - 12 so it just makes sense to wait!
 
 We can chat more when I see you!  Let either me or Wende know if you can make it!
 
 Talk to you later -
 
 Love,  Kim
 
  
     
 Hey....I am sad...we will not come home until Christmas Day.  Will you back
 after that?  I would love to spend some time with you!
 
 How is Houston?  I know you liked it there before but had grown to love the
 west.  Are you looking anywhere special for a job?...like Memphis?
 
 Have you heard from any one who worked in the World Trade Center?  Of course,
 I thought immediately of visiting your workplace there.  It was unbelievably
 horrible!
 
 Talk to you soon....I am so glad we are e-mailing!
 
 Love ya,
 
 Yonnie
