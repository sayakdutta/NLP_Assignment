 Resources, Cline Resources, and The American Coal Company.
 
  We plan to leave George Bush Intercontinental Airport early on Wenesday, 
 March 7 and return Thursday evening, March 8.  During the course of the 
 visit, we will tour two underground coal mines, a preparation plant, and a 
 new mine opening construction site.  You will also have the opportunity to 
 meet the principals, Richard Gilliam of Black Mountain, Chris Cline of Cline 
 Resources, and Bob Murray of the American Coal Company.
 
  Please review the attached, and let me know as soon as convenient the 
 following information:

  Plan to wear casual clothes (blue jeans) for the mine visits.  We are 
 planning to have dinner with Chris Cline on March 7.  If you have any 
 questions on the trip, let me know.
 
  Bill
