 
 A newly revised rule (Subpart HH) has just been implemented by the EPA 
 concerning curde oil tanks with a daily throughput of equal to or greater 
 than 500 bbls. per day.  If there is any tank within your teams area of 
 responsiblity which equals or exceeds the 500 bbls. per day throughput 
 criteria, please provide to me the following:
 
 
  tank name/serial number
 
  tank size
 
  average daily throughput
 
 Thanks for your help in this matter....
