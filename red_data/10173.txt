 The South Central Team has discussed Debra's Corrective Action Report and feel that she has met the demands we placed on her at the time the report was issued.  We have seen Debra work hard to get up to speed on our various interconnects and other procedures this year.  Debra has sharpened her focus on our business, gained competence in all areas requested, and is now able to support the team when needed.  We therefore request that this report be removed from her file. 
 
  Please let me know if anything more is needed to complete this updating for Debra. 
 
 Thank you,
 
 Janet McDaniel for the South Central Team
