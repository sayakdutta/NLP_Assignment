 
 I think the wedding is on for the 23rd.  My mom wants us to stay at a hotel 
 while in DC.  I think Bob would likely want us to stay in DC for Christmas 
 Day since Chi will be on honeymoon, but I am not real sure on this.  Bob is 
 out in OK over New Year's and I will need to go back up the following weekend 
 to stay with Mom while Bob is out.  What do you think.
 
 PS My mom is chain smoking - she bought a cartoon of cigarettes with Chi.  
 Chi thinks we should just let her make her own choices.  What do you think.
