 we need to add language that they won't disclose it to them without having 
 them sign a confidentiality agreement in substantially the same form as this 
 one.

 Kay,
 
 I spoke to Freddy Sanches regarding the ENA / Avista Steag CA.  Avista Steag 
 wants to be able to provide turbine performance data to their project partner 
 (who will not be disclosed in the CA).  Mr. Sanches suggested I add some 
 language to this effect to paragraph 1 of the CA.
 
 Additionally, Mr. Sanches wants me to change the defined term of AAvista 
 STeag LLC to "STEAG" rather than Avista.
 
 Attached is a revised CA - Please advise.
 
 Kathleen
