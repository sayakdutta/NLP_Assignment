 Hi Vince:
 This Zeigham Khokher at the University of Texas at  Austin, Finance 
 Department.
 ?
 I need some publicly available data that  unfortunately is not available 
 here.? It is basically the historical prices  for price of oil, gas and gold 
 futures contracts and options.
 ?
 Again the data is strictly public info and not  proprietary at all.? Let me 
 know if there is a central data person at Enron  who would be able to help.? 
 All help will be of course gratefully  acknowledged.
 ?
 Hope all is well, I hear you will be giving a talk  at UT this fall?and look 
 forward to seeing you then.
 ?
 Regards
 Zeigham
