 
 Lexi:  In our meeting last week, I thought that we handled both Greg and 
 Ryan, and were comfortable with Round 1 interviews only (2 interviewers) with 
 this disposition:  Greg as a keeper (wasn't he the one who worked in the 
 career center?) and no to Ryan.  
 
 I will be glad to do a phone interview this week with 
 
 
    
 	Enron North America Corp.
 	
 	 	
 


   
 Dear Interviewers:
 
 As a follow-up from campus interviews, the following candidates still need to 
 be screened:
 
 Greg Carlson and Ryan Morrison -- Need round 2 interviews
 Matthew Hutchison -- Needs round 1 and round 2 interviews
 
 Please let me know if you are interested in interviewing these candidates via 
 telephone this week.
 
 Thank you!
