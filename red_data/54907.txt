 
 Jeff,
 
 Our friends at the University of Texas are planning a conference on energy
 economics and finance in February of next year. They would like very much to 
 have 
 you as a keynote speaker. 
 
 Given our good, long-term  relationship with UT,  I would recommend
 that you speak at this conference. I talked to Prof. Ehud Ronn
 a few times about the program and  I think that this will be 
 an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and
 agenda for the future.
 
 I am sure that Rick Causey will join me in making the same recommendation.
 
 Vince
