 
 Attached is a revised construction agreement (redlined version) incorporating 
 the changes we discussed.  I have not changed either the liquidated damages 
 or force majeure provisions at this point.  Ron, you indicated in your voice 
 mail that you wanted to wait until things firmed up a bit more with respect 
 to those provisions.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
 
 Not sure if we should forward to EE&CC at this point yet, given the 
 uncertainty on the two provisions.  What are your thoughts?  Thanks
