 Tana,
 
 I automatically shut down all for European physical power. 
 
 
     
 I'm just sitting here worrying about one of my side deals with Frank, so just 
 to reiterate a global shut down (like-no one does Credit Derivatives unless 
 we really mean it), no non-European based counterparty (in all probability, 
 no counterparty originating from U.S. Credit) should be approved to trade 
 European physical power products.  They have licensing requirements similar 
 to our FERC licensing.
 
 Thanks!
