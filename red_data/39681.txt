 Mark:
 
 In follow-up to our conversation at lunch Monday, I am hoping to take 
 Thursday and Friday of next week off (December 14 and 15).  That will bring 
 me down to having only a week left.  After that, I will be taking only a day 
 or two on a "when it looks good" basis.  Let me know if  you have any 
 concerns with that schedule.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Jeff
