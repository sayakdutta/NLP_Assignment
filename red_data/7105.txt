 
 COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) - Football practice was delayed on Tuesday
  for nearly two hours at Texas A&M University.
 
 One of the players, while on his way to the locker room, happened to
 look down and notice a suspicious looking, unknown white powdery
 substance on the practice field. Practice was immediately suspended by
 Coach R.C.
 Slocum while the FBI was called in to investigate.
 
 After a complete field analysis, the FBI determined that the foreign
 white substance that they found was the goal line.
