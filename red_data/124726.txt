 Group,
 We will have a meeting on Thursday of next week at 4 PM (Pizza will be provided--finally) on JAN 24th. I hope our transition to UBS from Enron will be complete by next Wednesday. If so, we will be discussing what we hope to achieve this year and the look of the floor going forward. If not, this meeting will likely be postponed. Please call me with any questions.
 
 Thanks,
 Bill
