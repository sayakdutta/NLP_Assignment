 
 Thanks for forwarding mail to me.  I apologize for the inconvenience of 

 the past few months by the technology group that all addresses use the long 

 That was printed on my business cards, many of which are still in circulation 
 I am sure.  When ECT became ENA, I changed my e:mail address to drop the ect 
 reference and to use my long name rather than sbeck.  So I can see why you 
 would receive my mail on occassion if someone is either making an educated 
 guess on the address or referencing my old card.  SInce there are at least 2 
 sbeck's here, have you thought about adopting use of your long name address 
 rather than the shorter version to help in further differentiating between 
 us?   That might help eliminate confusion going forward.
