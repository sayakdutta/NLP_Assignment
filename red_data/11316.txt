 Rick,
 
 John, Jim and Brad were instrumental in getting this restructuring done.  It 
 feels good when the process works.

 Please book a $512,087 USD credit reserve for the following deals:
 
 Deal #:  E98254.4 and EA8461.1
 Counterparty:  Barrett Resources Corporation
 Originating Unit:  ENA
 
 Description:  These are existing transactions that have been restructured to 
 compensate Enron for assuming credit risk above the contractual credit 
 lines.  The strike prices for each of the transactions were reduced, 
 resulting in a $512,087 increase in value.  The entirety of this value is to 
 be taken into the Credit Reserve.
 
 Please call me if you have any questions.
 
 Thanks,
 
 John
