 
 Hi, Kerry and Rick,
 
 Hope you are enjoying the employer.  Here, it is flooding again -- my son's school is closed today because of flooding.  What fun!
 
 Here is a request from our business guys to get information on a potential labor dispute.  Any information you can get without being obvious would be helpful.
 
 Thanks.
 
 Michelle

 Pursuant to our telephone conversation, I am forwarding you this e-mail.  As I advised we would like to obtain whatever information we can on a labor situation between Midwest Generation and the IBEW in the Chicago area.  
 
 Thanks,
 
 Jeff
