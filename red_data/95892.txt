 have to cancel - I would know by lunch). If you want, we could maybe try 
 hitting at the HCC (the Houstonian courts are booked, otherwise we could try 
 there) - now that I45 is closed, traffic around the MET during rush hour is 
 terrible and I wouldn't want you to get stuck.  If this doesn't work, just 
 let me know and we can find another time.
