 I'm currently working on FUGG right now.   After our lunch meeting I should be able to give you the Sinclair and Thermo numbers along with FUGG.

 Couple other things Theresa...Do we have Sinclair numbers for July? And, are the Thermo numbers in Sitara good?
 
 Thanks

 Paul's deal with Petrogulf is for 265.  The June deal was 360.  Every month will have a 10% swing on it.  I haven't looked at the numbers yet for July to see what volume we'll actually be purchasing.  
 I think he always rolls the EJW and I haven't seen a fax from them yet.  I'll let you know.

 Thanks Theresa.
 
 Do you know if Paul did a deal with EJW for July?  Also, do you know why the PSCO deal with Petrogulf is in the system as 265 on the supply side?  I thought the deal was for 360 w/ a 10% swing capability.
