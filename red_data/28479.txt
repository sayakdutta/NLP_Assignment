 It's that time of year again.  In connection with our 2000 audit, we are 
 coordinating a meeting to go over the legal, environmental, and regulatory 
 issues for ETS.  Attached is the proposed agenda for the meeting.  Let me 
 know if I have not contacted all the right people for this meeting so that I 
 may include them.  Call me if you have any questions.  Thanks.
