 transactions that are slightly different from templates now used for 
 telephone-generated transactions - Legal will have to give the confirm desk 
 the necessary language.  This is not the GTC issue you and I discussed the 
 other day - rather, I think the question is How will the internet-generated 
 trade information reach the confirm desk and how will they know to use the 
 internet trading language in the confirm they generate?

 I have met w/ Mark Taylor and submitted all US based GTC / masters agreement 
 regarding the above note.  As you are aware, these legal agreements are part 
 of the confirm process.  Mark will be requesting outside counsel to make 
 recommendations.

 I know this came up early on in the proceedings - I'll make sure its still on 
 someone's radar.

 On our confirmations (which are spat out of the systems) we often say the 
 transaction as agreed over phone - should we be altering these.  Are we 
 already doing this?
