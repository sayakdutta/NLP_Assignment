 
 Shane,  Can you send me the highlighted document that you forwarded for their review.  I need to see the revision to understand their issue.
 
 
  
     
     Gerald:  
    Please review the reply from  Mojave regarding "our" standard GISB TPA.  Please comment.
 
    Thanks
 
    Shane
 
  
     
 Shane,
 	Please clarify the intent of the requested change to section 5.
 
 Thanks,
 Karen
