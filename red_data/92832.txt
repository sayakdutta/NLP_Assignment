 
 Stacey,
 
 I have a couple of questions for you to ensure that we report the positions 
 correctly.  First, is this a Power East or Power West book?  Second, when can 
 we expect to be reporting positions in this book?  Finally, who is the trader 
 for this book?
 
 Thanks for your help.

 Stacey:
 
 Can you please confirm that new book PWR-NY-GAS-MTM should be included in the 
 AGG-PWRII portfolio for VaR purposes?  Can you further indicate into which 
 subportfolio of AGG_PWRII the book should be added?
 
 
 Robin:
 
 In order for you to capture the positions for the GAS bench, does the book 
 need to be included within any GAS portfolio?
 
 
 I look forward to your responses.
 
 
 
 Nancy
