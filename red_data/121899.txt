 Steve Harris would like to let you know that your hard work during the past few months has been sincerely appreciated.
 
 A "Thank You Luncheon" has been scheduled to express this appreciation.  Please mark your calendars to attend a luncheon on Friday, September 7, 2001, from 11:30a - 3:00p at Jillian's, 7620 Katy Freeway.
 
 We hope that each of you will be able to share this time with Steve and the TW Commercial Group.
 
 Please RSVP to me by Friday, August 31.
