 
 I was waiting by the phone all day and night for you to call, but no, I was 
 ever dissappointed that I was not a high priority for you.  I suppose I'll 
 just keep waiting.

 Hey cutie, I just spent forever writing you a nice little reply to your
 email on the ski trip, my email availibility, phone b.s, your NYC trip and
 Scully, all to have this piece of shit freeze up....so I think perhaps I
 will just try to get some time to call you tonight!!!!
 love, k
 
 You should now have checks from myself, Duncan and Bill.  Sharon said she
 would get back to me today, but I think we should jump on this lodge asap.
