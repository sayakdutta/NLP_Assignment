 Brain glitch!  It was two legs of the same deal!
 
 I also found #550042 and 550048 that look like it needs to be confirmed also.
 
 Thanks!

 I think this is an issue with Diana's deal entry, because I just asked Sean 
 Crandall and he said you can go ahead and confirm all of these deals. I've 
 changed the confirm status, and I'll look into it more later this afternoon 
 when the traders are less busy. Also, did you mean to write 549903 twice, or 
 is there another deal number?
 
 Thanks,
 Kate
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
   
  
 We came across some deals on the not to be confirmed report that look like 
 they should be confirmed.  Can you check and see why these came up not to be 
 confirmed.  We thought we had fixed the system so that the daily deals in the 
 west would default to be confirmed so I need to know if this was a conscious 
 decision or something the comuter is defaulting to.  Am I making sense?  Call 
 me if you need to interpret this message!
