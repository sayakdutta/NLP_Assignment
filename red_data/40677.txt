 no in fact we are increasing our short term lines of credit until the Enron situation is cleared in the market.  We had planned on a $250 million bond deal in October after the market had absorbed the news about the PGE acquisition but then Enron stock cratered and the bankers told us their was no economic deal that could be done. So we are waiting for things to clear up a bit and hopefully get into the market before year end.  We requested the additional short term lines in case this problem continues through next year which it may.  Call me if you would like further info.  Stan is already aware of this situation.
 

 Got me to thinking, how are you guys doing?    Where are you in the cash
 management world?     I know you were tight before, is the situation any
 better?
