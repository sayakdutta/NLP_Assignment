 Joe,
 
 I looked at the sheet, and I think it will be very helpful.  When I open it however, its giving me an error message - "error updating database."  and then it freezes.  Any ideas?  Is it something I can update each day from the file you gave me, or do you have it saved in a directory that I could just open?  I will be up on 31 at 10:30 , and can swing by your desk if you will have a minute.  Thanks for all your help!

 Joe,
 
 My name is Castlen Moore, and I work with Narsimha Misra on the EES desk.  Anna Santucci and I are managing the Nepool hedging for EES, and Narsimha mentioned you might have a spreadsheet that could be helpful to us.  He said he thought it was pulling info daily from the web on various fundamentals.  Give me a call or email me when you have a minute.  Anything on Nepool would be greatly appreciated by Anna and I.
 
 Thanks!
