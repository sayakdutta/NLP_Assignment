 Dear Sara:
 
 Further to our meeting of November 30, 1999, please be advised that the 
 Central Bank of Brazil and the Brazilian Securities and Exchange Commission 
 are preparing certain new regulations in connection with foreign investments 
 in Brazil.
 
 Since it seems that such new regulations may materially change the chart 
 discussed during our last meeting, we have not amended the chart yet aiming 
 to conclude it after the new regulations are finally released, which is 
 supposed to occur early next year.
 
 For the moment, drafts of such new regulations were released to the market 
 for discussion purposes a couple of days ago, a translation into English is 
 being prepared and will be faxed to your attention shortly.
 
 Should you have any questions in respect of the above matters, please do not 
 hesitate to contact us.
 
 Kind regards,
 
 Marcelo Rodrigues
