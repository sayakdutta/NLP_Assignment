 
 Steve,
 
 I have a book edited by Helyette regarding insurance derivatives.
 I shall make a few copies of the most important articles
 for you.

 I've just been speaking to Gillian Lockwood from our Tax group, who is 
 interested in your work on ins. derivs.  Have you any general articles on the 
 principles of pricing these instruments?
 
 Many thanks,
 Steve
