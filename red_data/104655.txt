 Teresa, as I mentioned, attached is revised term sheet intended to reflect 
 latest commercial changes but subject to legal review.  Please particularly 
 consider (with commercial and operational teams as appropriate) Engineering 
 (eligibility) Criteria applicable to proposed VPPs, and proposed terms of 
 Balancing Agreement, Master Natural Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement, and 
 Master Crude Oil Purchase and Sale Agreement.  Of course, any other thoughts 
 you have are most welcome.
 
 We are having an internal meeting (global finance, accounting and tax) to 
 discuss term sheet at 2:00 PM on Friday, 11/10/00 in EB 2868.  
 
 If you can meet with us on Friday or otherwise give us feedback by Friday 
 afternoon, it would help facilitate finalization of term sheet and movement 
 to drafting of definitive documents.
 
 Thanks, NJD
