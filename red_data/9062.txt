 
 Great job, as usual, on the United Way kick off today.  I saw Amy Leeand 
 Eylesse Kalmans as I left the Hyatt and I told them.  Please pass the kudos 
 along to the rest of your team.  The theme was timely, the staging was great, 
 the questions on the gameshow were even educational for newer Enron 
 employees, giving a little histsory and folklore about Enron.  (I knew the 
 WLEC 1 answer!)  
 
 I especially enjoyed the breakfast at Depelchin last Friday.  Their programs 
 are important to all of us and the tour was very moving as we met some of the 
 children in the shelter.
