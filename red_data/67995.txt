 I apologize, we have been a little delinquent on the thank you cards this year, we are usually really good about it.  He got those horses and absolutely loves them.  We got him a fisher price farm for Christmas and he had just opened that when he opened the horses.  We couldn't get him to open another give for half an hour playing with those horses. They go great with the farm and plays with them all the time.  Thanks.  
 
  
     
 On second thought, I'll trade you our cup for two dozen Enron golf balls. Also, Karen is driving me crazy wanting to know if Young Jack got his horses and if he likes them. Please let me know, I don't have too far to go on the crazy part. Love, Steve
