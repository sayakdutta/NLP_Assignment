 
 Hi, Athena:
 
 The Williams counterparties are:  Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Company and Williams Refining & Marketing, L.L.C.  I don't know about British Energy as that is being handled out of our London office.
 
 The following entities have been added to our master netting agreement list today:
 
 Forest Oil:
 Forest Oil Corporation
 Producers Marketing Ltd.
 
 Noble:
 Noble Gas Marketing Inc.
 Samedan Oil Corporation
 
 Tractebel Energy Marketing, Inc.
 
 My phone number is (713) 853-3907.
 
 Thanks!

 Hi, Marie, hope all is well.  In order to complete our conflicts checks on
 two counterparties, we need to know exactly which Williams and British
 Energy Power and Energy Trading Limited entities/subsidiaries will be
 involved in the Master Netting Agreements.  Please let me know.  Also,
 going forward, we will need this type of information for any new
 counterparties added to the current list.  Thanks and please call with any
 questions.
 
 Best Regards,
 Athena
 
 P.S.  Please send me your telephone number.  Thanks!
