 for each group on terminated transactions (eg the financial trades, the power 
 trades, the US gas trades and the Canadian gas trades).  Thanks

 The libor curves are calculated using market data at the close of the day for 
 swap instruments namely the libor cash rates (published on Telerate page 
 3750), eurodollar curve (prices published on Telerate 910) and the swap curve 
 (prices published on Telerate 19901). The interpolated spot curve is 
 calculated using a boot-strapping methodology. Discount rates can be 
 calculated from these published zero rates by using the formula d(t) = 1
