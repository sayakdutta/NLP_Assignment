 i got the scoop from lavo.  
 
 i agreed to become the premier Enron options trader (only if i didn't have to sit next to you).  i told lavo to give me two weeks w/you and i could fake my way through any interview. VAR, gamma, vega, blah, blah,blah . . . i'm hired!  Who do you think w/d pay me more El Paso or Duke?
