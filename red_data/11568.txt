 Based on recent discussions with several energy firms, there appears to be
 interest in conducting a survey which
 *	summarizes the current state of risk management best practices
 within the industry, and
 *	provides benchmark data addressing current levels of risk based
 performance for various energy related lines of business
 
 To respond to this interest, we would like to conduct a survey which
 addresses these goals. We have prepared a proposal which outlines our
 approach for conducting a survey, and provides samples of expected output. I
 will be in touch sometime next week to discuss the proposal with you, and
 determine your interest in participating.
 
 I look forward to speaking with you, and potentially working with you as a
 participant in this project.
