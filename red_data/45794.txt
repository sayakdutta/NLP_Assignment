 
 Per Leslie's earlier email, she wants power trading for Tri-State only under 
 one entity, so I have shut down Tri-State Power Marketing (the division), and 
 have opened them up under Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, 
 Inc., which, per my conv. w/Stephanie, is being amended to add "through its 
 Tri-State Power Marketing Division" to the PA.
