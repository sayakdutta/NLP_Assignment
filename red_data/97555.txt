  Allen and Indiana counsel talked yesterday. We have a conference call in the 
 works for Monday with Kevin, Allen, maybe Wayne and Indiana counsel.  You're 
 welcome to attend. 
 
  
     
 Should we set up a meeting next week w/ the coal guys and Indiana counsel? Do 
 you want me to come?

 Richard,
 
 Wanted to drop a line to see if you had any word/guidance on the 
 termination/dispute language.  Can you call me early next week?
