 FYI, if you haven't already seen this, Congressional Democrats on the 
 Commerce Committee are leading an effort to send the attached letter to 
 President Bush.
 
 Thanks,

         Mr. President, we request that you help protect California's
 economy, and indeed that of the Western region and the nation.  Please
 support the Governors' request on wholesale rates, investigate the recent
 allegations of overcharges, and act to prevent a dysfunctional electricity
 market from damaging our constituents and a major engine of the nation's
 economy.
 
                         Sincerely,
