 him directly.

 Vince,
 
 What do you think about asking Andy Fastow to come to the Texas Finance
 Festival this April as our luncheon speaker?  If you agree I'll go ahead
 and call him.  If you have an opportunity to speak with him about the
 conference that would be great.  The date is April 21st (that's a Saturday).
 
 Hope you are enjoying NY.  Shirley tells me that you're running up your
 frequent flyer miles again.
 
 your friend,
 
 john
