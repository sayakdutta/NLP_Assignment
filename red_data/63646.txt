   Attached please find the final draft.  Tim Koller and I hope
 it reflects all the changes suggested on the last conference call.  Of
 course, we will never be able to satisfy everyone to the last detail, but I
 think we came as close as we will get.
 
   There is still some proof reading and minor editing to do,
 and we are working on that even as we send this off.
 
   To the best of my knowledge there may now be two "individual
 views"  to go into what is now Attachment D.  Len Baker may feel that the
 language on Safe Harbor doesn't go far enough.  Baruch Lev feels that the
 SEC should not only issue a "concept release" to solicit broad public
 comments on a "supplementary framework for reporting intangibles," but it
 should create a task force to do the work.  (Most of the group feels this
 approach is too close to asking the SEC to mandate change.)  Baruch also
 feels that in relying so much on voluntary disclosure, we are exaggerating
 what companies will, in fact, disclose. My suggestion, Len and Baruch, is to
 write a paragraph or two for Attachment D, if you wish.  Hopefully, both of
 you will begin with a sentence supporting the report in general, but if you
 feel strongly that the report doesn't reflect all your views, please do
 state them for the record.
 
   Before we schedule a final call for last minute details,
 etc,  I'd like to request an e-mail, fax or phone call from each of you
 letting me know if you can sign-off on the report.  I'd appreciate this by
 Monday, April 16th.
 
   Thanks a million.
 
   Best regards,
   Jeff
