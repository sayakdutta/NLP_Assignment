 
 Brian, just so you know Transwestern's reaction, Pedersen's exhibit contains 
 factual inaccuracies we cannot live with (e.g., footnote 4).  If he wants to 
 file his own exhibit he is certainly free to do so.  We don't plan to offer 
 any comments to Norm regarding his exhibit at this time.  
 
 With regard to the exhibit you sent us yesterday, while Transwestern feels 
 there are many different ways to characterize delivery capacity to the 
 border, and we probably would have drafted the document differently, we would 
 support SoCal's filing of the exhibit with the Commission as it is currently 
 drafted for purposes of this proceeding.
 
 Any questions or comments -- let me know.

      Your proposed draft exhibit goes substantially beyond the ALJ's order.
 ALJ Biren specifically stated that the the late-filed exhibit "should be
 narrowly focused on the mismatch of capacity." Tr. 1021.Thus, you need to
 eliminate the column entitled "Total Take-away Capacity."  Furthermore, the
 column is both suspect (e.g., the representation that EOR is 770 MMcfd) and
 misleading (e.g., the inclusion of SWG or PG&E in "S. Calif Take-away
 Capacity").  Also, you need to eliminate the "Avg. Daily Market" box.  The
 following is what should be submitted to ALJ Biren:
 (See attached file: #1070989 v1 - FIRM PIPELINE CAPACITY DELIVERY (EX. TO
 I.99-07-003).doc)
  - #1070989 v1 - FIRM PIPELINE CAPACITY DELIVERY (EX. TO I.99-07-003).doc
