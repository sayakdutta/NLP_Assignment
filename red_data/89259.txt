 The person that I was talking to at Dynegy left. What was the problem with the original grty? Did they not make the initial changes that Gerald wanted?
 
 What about the AES NewEnergy, Inc Enfolio?

  I am waiting on revisions to the Dynegy Holdings, Inc. Gty.  So if you can push on these folks it would be great.  I have sent the final draft to Nicor Energy, LLC today for their review.  The Nicor Gty is ok.
 
 
 
  
     
 Can you please give me the status on the grties that i sent to you for Nicor Energy LLC from Nicor Inc and Dynegy Holdings, Inc?
 
 Can you tell me who is requesting an Enfolio for AES NewEnergy, Inc?
