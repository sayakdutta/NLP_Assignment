 At the request of Mike Bridges, I am attaching our proposed form of 
 Non-Disclosure Agreement.   If the enclosed meets with your approval, please 
 execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will 
 then have it executed by an officer of Enron.  If you have any comments or 
 questions please do not hesitate to call me at (713) 853-3399, or Mark 
 Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at (713) 345-8897.  We look forward to hearing 
 from you.
