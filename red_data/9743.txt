 used last year for headcount addtions.  Let's complete those for these 
 positions and have Fred and Scott Neal sign them.  They need to understand 
 the addtional cost associated with these requests.  They will forget later in 
 the year if they aren't making much money.  
 
 Do you agree that these positions are needed and will add value?  --Sally

 Fred would like me to hire an additional person to strictly focus on his 
 deals across all commodities.  He says that his people don't have time to 
 look at these reports.  Also,  Scott Neal wants 11 new physical books on the 
 east region.  This will require at least two more risk people,  and probably 
 two new OA people.  We told him that yesterday,  and he was fine with that.
