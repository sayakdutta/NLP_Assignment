 reports have been very beneficial in quantifying some of our recent 
 transporting deals on Transwestern.  For example, we executed a one year deal 
 for 20000/day at our maximum tariff rate, which will generate $4 million 
 gross margin.  Another one year deal for 8000/day, also to the California 
 border, will give us over $1 million gross margin.  Two other examples for 11 
 months each will generate an additional combined $1.5 million.  Hopefully 
 this will justify our need for this system.  Let me know if you need anything 
 else.

 Michelle, I am trying to get some quantification of actual benefits (in terms 
 of $'s saved or loss avoided) of your use of the model.  Could you give me 
 some feedback before Tuesday, as Phil Lowry is asking about use and actual 
 benefits of this model.
 
 Thanks
 
 Kim
