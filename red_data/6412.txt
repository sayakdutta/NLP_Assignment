  >>A Longhorn fan used to amuse himself by scaring
  >>every A & M fan he would
  >>see strutting down the side of the road in their
  >>obnoxious burgandy and white
  >>colors.
  >>
  >>He would swerve his van as if to hit them, and
  >>then he would swerve back
  >>on the road just before hitting them.
  >>
  >>One day, as the van driver was driving along, he
  >>saw a priest. He thought
  >>he would do a good deed and pulled the van over.
  >>He asked the priest,
  >>"Where are you going, Father?"
  >>
  >>"I'm going to give Mass at St. Patrick's Church,
  >>about five miles down the road," replied the priest.
  >>
  >>"No problem, Father! I'll give you a lift. Climb
  >>in!"  The priest climbed
  >>into the passenger seat, and the van continued
  >>down the road.
  >>
  >>Suddenly, the driver saw a A & M fan strutting
  >>down the road, and
  >>instinctively, he swerved as if to hit him. But,
  >>as usual, just in time,
  >>he swerved back to the road, narrowly missing the guy.
  >>
  >>Even though he was certain he missed the guy, he
  >>still heard a loud
  >>"THUD." Not understanding where the noise came
  >>from,  he glanced in his mirrors,
  >>but he didn't see anything.
  >>
  >>He then remembered the priest, and he turned  to
  >>the priest and said, "I'm
  >>sorry, Father. I almost hit that Aggie fan."
  >>
  >>"That's OK," replied the priest. "I got
  >>  him with the door."
  >>
