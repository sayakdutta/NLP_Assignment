 
 I would like to but we may have to put it off until next week.    I am currently working weird hours trying to get the $1B of debt closed and funded.   I will get back to you.

 Rod,
 
 I suppose with everything going on you are probably pretty busy, but I was wondering if Biliana Pehlivanova and I can join you for lunch at your convenience.
 
 Please let me know if this could potentially work. Thank you and hope to meet with you soon.
 
 Sincerely,
 
 Anya Beylin
