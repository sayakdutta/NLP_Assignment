 
 I haven't forgotten.  I have one last trap to run, which I will be able to finish in the next few days.
 
  
     
 Steve,
 
 I talked with Cindy a few weeks ago about a salary adjustment for me (and Mary) following the HR re-org (actually this was probably end of June). Cindy indicated she had discussed this with you and that some recommendations had either been agreed or where being considered. I think she suggested she (or you) may prefer to agree a new/extended employment agreement, which I would be happy to discuss.
 
 Either way, I really would like to close this out in the next few days since things are obviously moving on and I don't want this weighing in the back of my mind. 
 
 If you would prefer I'd be happy to recommend, consider and approve it myself! I'm am incredibly fair and impartial, I assure you..........
