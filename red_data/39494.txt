 I think your best shot at Enron would be in paper with Bryan.  I think we got 
 a gift -- I remember Susan saying something.  I am just the Dad!  Everything 
 is going well.  Keep me posted on your job opportunities or if you want me to 
 follow up with anyone here.

 Hi Mark:
 
 I heard from Ted Bland last week. He said that George still has not tested 
 the equipment and Bryan has not met with the COO about hiring yet. 
 
 I am looking forward to an offer coming in this week from a small public 
 company that wants me to develop a new business development group and 
 increase their sales from $10MM to $50MM over the next couple of  years and 
 get the stock price up. 
 
 I am still operating the fitness company but it is quickly coming to an end 
 due to running out of money so I am looking forward to finding a new position 
 in the next couple of weeks. 
 
 Everyone is settled into school and doing well. What is new with you and your 
 family? 
 
 Debbie and I sent you and Susan a gift a month or so ago for having Bryan 
 stay with you. Did you receive it? 
 
 I look forward to hearing from you.
 
 Larry
