 550480- 
 Kate I just called Prebon and they said they made a mistake the cp should be 
 Morgan not Merrill........
 
 
 
 
 

 
   
  
 550480 has been changed to Merrill per Sean Crandall
 
 550383 and 550385 - I'm still waiting to hear from Mike Driscoll on these - 
 I'll let you know.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate

 Hi Kate, Stephanie Checkout with Prebon because I was out last week and I am 
 still trying to clear up some deals from the 14th.   The west checkout person 
 at Prebon is on vacation and his back-up is just now getting back with me on 
 these discrepancies.
