 
 Hi guys, 
 
 Here's a list of questions as I'm working through MDEA.  Actually, some are 
 questions, some are reminders of things you were going to send me:
 
 Receipt Point - need def'n  RR
 Load info - I was going to plug in something, or we were going to have an 
 exhibit to describe.  RR
 Off peak defn - RR 
 transmission - we've added transmission services, but it isn't defnd.  Any 
 suggestions?
 scheduling equipment - do we want to refer to the list?
 term - previously I was instructed to take out the evergreen renewal, now is 
 it back in?  If so, is the mechanism in the first draft ok?
 contracted resources - I've added in a def'n - we need a schedule. Name, 
 date, subject matter of contract.
 
 More questions to come, but I wanted to get this to you asap.  Reagan, you 
 might want to look through the comments you gave me for more open items.
 
 Thanks!
 
 Kay
