 Lillian, please advise whether the following two names are available for TW's 
 new company:
 
 Mavrix Corp.
 New West Transportation Trading Corp.
 
 Sorry to leave you hanging for so long on this.  I told my commercial people 
 I hoped they had more enthusiasm about naming their children!
 
 If you could let me know before COB Monday I'd appreciate it.
 
 Questions -- I'm at x30596.

 Lillian, please see the attached authorization memo.  It is still in draft 
 form, but since time is of the essence, Geneva advised me to forward it to 
 you now so that you could start working on it.  We would like to have the new 
 company formed today if possible.  I will let you know if I make any changes 
 to the attached.  In the meantime, please do not hesitate to call if you have 
 questions.
