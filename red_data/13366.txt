 backup!  Michelle

 Hi, Brooks.
 
 He wants the newest Lyle Lovett album -- the soundtrack to Dr. T and the
 Women.  Also, he is getting a Playstation II from me for his birthday (they
 don't come out until this week, so he doesn't have it yet), so you could
 find him a game for the new system.  He has said that he wants a new clock
 radio, with AM/FM (I don't think he wants CD/tape player on it), with
 battery backup -- Sony would be best.  Also, he always wears short-sleeved
 Polo shirts, size XL.  He prefers basics, in solid colors such as white (he
 never can have enough of those), navy, khaki, or light blue.
 
 Let me know if you need any other suggestions.
 
 We are looking forward to your visit, especially Cameron.  He always is
 talking about how Santa is going to bring presents for him and Madison!
 Take care, and say "hi" to Marianne.

 Michelle,
      Can you give me any ideas regarding birthday and x-mas presents for
