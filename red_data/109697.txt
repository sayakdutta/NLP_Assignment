 
 Michael, I'm responding on behalf of Jeff Skilling, who is traveling abroad.
 
 It appears that this is informational only for Jeff, and you are not inviting 
 him to attend the meetings.  If this is an invitation to attend, he is unable 
 to as he will still be traveling abroad.

 I have made some arrangements in scheduling potential investment bankers to 
 talk with us about our current project.  I have informed them about our 
 current situation and thinking, and they will be prepared to present their 
 ideas on deal process, potential investors/buyers, valuation, fee proposal, 
 credentials etc.  I plan to make a decision very quickly regarding whom we 
 will work with, and get the process moving as quickly as possible.
 
 We will meet with Merrill Lynch on Monday February 28 (a time has not yet 
 been designated)
 Schroder's will be in our offices on Wednesday March 1, 2000 at 9:30 am
 I am still trying to schedule a date and time with Nicholas Wrigley and 
 Rothchild
 
 I would greatly appreciate your letting me know if (1) you have interest in 
 attending these meetings and (2) you can attend a Merrill meeting on Monday 
 and the Schroder's meeting on Wednesday.  Thanks.
