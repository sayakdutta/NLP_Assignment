 Since Enron and EBS are trying to cut costs and be more cost effective, why 
 would a vice president need an executive computer setup at home?  Especially 
 if they already have a laptop (provided by Enron)  they take home every night 
 and have taken advantage of the Click at Home program as well.  Since Enron 
 has gone through the expense of giving each and every employee the 
 opportunity of the Click at Home program, it seems to be a somewhat redundant 
 expense of which I might add is unnecessary in my opinion.
 
 I feel it would behoove ALL EMPLOYEES, including executives, to be more 
 conscientious of costs and expenses to improve Enron's and EBS' bottom-line.  
 How can we ("Enron") be a world leading company if we don't have leading 
 world leaders that spend Enron's money as if it were there own.
 
 I think it would be in Enron's best interest to set some guidelines regarding 
 expenses such as these.  Just because a person is an executive of the company 
 why should be allowed to have anything they want just because they can?
 
 Thank you for your time and the opportunity to express myself.  Especially 
 since I am a shareholder also and care where the money goes.
