 
 I've asked for it separately (second item below).  Did I misunderstand your 
 question?
 
 I'm setting up a table with all the stuff for signature now.

 Kay,
 
 Do the retainage LOC's flow from the receipt of funds letter, or do we need 
 to tee up those separately?

 Good morning.
 
 In order to finish up Delta/Salmon tomorrow, please note we need the 
 following today:
 
 GE parent guaranty
 LOC (so that full payment can be made to GE tomorrow)
 Opinion of counsel
 
 And once funds are received by GE, we need the receipt of funds letter.
 
 Lee, I haven't heard back from the Portland gang to find out if the LV Co Gen 
 contract is ready.  Maybe Jake can help shake that loose.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
