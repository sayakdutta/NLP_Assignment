 
 Laura,
 
 Thanks for confirming the  meeting on September the 5th.
 
 We shall be coming on a company plane from San Jose and this gives us
 a lot of flexibility in planning of the agenda.
 
 Please, let me know when would you like to start the meeting and we shall
 be glad to adjust. I assume you are on Mountain Time
 and this means we shall lose one hour flying east from California.
 
 
 Vince
