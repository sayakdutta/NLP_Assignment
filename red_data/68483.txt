From the recent articles I have read in the Alabama papers, it appears she was a phenomenal mother and friend.  We were also pleased to see his positive comments regarding his teammates, fellow students and alumni of Auburn.  The auburn spirit is special and it means a lot to those of us who spent time there to hear current players and students share the same beliefs.  We are sure he will continue to honor his mother and her memory by his outstanding play on the field and dedication in the classroom.  Thank you Mr. Walker for making us all proud to be an Auburn Tiger.  Please respond via email to let us know if the University or anyone else has set up a memorial fund or scholarship in her name.  We would really like to donate money in her name.  Thanks and War Eagle.
