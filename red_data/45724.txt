 Thanks for the update!  I hope things are getting better for you since you're 
 getting more people to help with financials.
 
 


























   
 We have received a revised Unanimous Consent of Directors dated 8/28/00 
 ("Board Resolution") from the referenced Counterparty which expands the 
 approval given in their initial Board Resolution (provided when we executed 
 the ISDA Master Agreement) to allow them to enter into "pulp, lumber and 
 paper commodity price swap and options, and other commodity price swap and 
 option transactions"  with ENA.
 
 For ClickPaper, this should allow them to trade all the financial products we 
 trade.  For EnronOnline, this should allow them to trade all commodity swaps 
 and options.  If Credit will add this to the next spreadsheets for both 
 ClickPaper and EnronOnline, I will amend my approval.
 
 I will circulate a copy of the revised Board Resolution to Global Contracts 
 and Camille Gerard.
