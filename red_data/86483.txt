 I spoke to legal.  Other than the non-solicitation agreements some former employees may have signed companies have not been informed that they may not hire Enron employees.  Particularly in the case where an employee seeks out employment with another company the other company is in no way liable for speaking to or employing that employee as long as the employee is not under an employment contract.
