 don't you think?  At least now WE know it!

 I talked to Vanessa Bob at x36781 regarding this matter.  She said she's 
 forwarded this on to the JK Group which will pay the amount shortly.  The 
 matching gifts are paid quarterly.

 Hello.
 
 I gave the Matagorda County Fair & Livestock Association $2050, and filled 
 out the form for the match.  Please advise if this has been paid, as they are 
 sending me a bill for the $2050, plus a finance charge.
 
 Thank you,
