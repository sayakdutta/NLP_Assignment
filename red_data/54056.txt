 Dear Mr. Kaminski
 
 Please excuse the cancellation due to illness.  The students do not care who
 they infect near the end of the semester, they just want to get done!
 
 Here is my available schedule for next year.  I am now overloaded next week
 with tasks to complete the semester.  I do hope that we can reschedule
 during the first quarter next year.
 
 I would note that my schedule is most free for Thursday or Friday.  I could
 fly out late Wednesday night.
 
 Cordially,
 
 Gerry
