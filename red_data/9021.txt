 
 If you absolutely can not find enough of the right players to go on the 
 cruise, let me know.  My husband is scheduled for a baseball game on 
 Wednesday night.  If I could find some Diamond level tickets for another day 
 for him, he might consider giving up his tickets for Wednesday night.  This 
 is a last resort sort of measure, however, so I hope that you find success in 
 response from others. But do let me know...
