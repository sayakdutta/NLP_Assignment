 
 Dale,
 
 I have passed on the information you gave me but you have to realize that
 I acted just as a go-between. I shall be glad to remind our new business unit
 about your proposal. I have already asked a few times.
 
 I shall be traveling this week, Wed - Fri. I shall be back in the office on 
 Monday.

 Just wanted to make sure you know we are still vitally interested in getting
 together with you and the key Enron people.  Thanks so much for all your
 help.  I understand how busy you and the new person are, but I hope you are
 interested enough to find a slot for us.  I think it will benefit you as
 well as us.
 
 Dale
