 
 Ms. Conners:
 
 Thank you for your recent letter regarding my personal financial 
 situation.    I do appreciate your concern and interest; however, I have a 
 very qualified financial advisor who handles ALL of my personal financial 
 needs.
 
 Please remove my name from your written correspondence/phone call contact 
 list.
 
 Sincerely,
 Stan Horton
