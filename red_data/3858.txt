 Open Presentation
 Monday, October 2nd - 6:00 PM
 Alumni Hall, room 203
 
 Please meet in the lobby of the hotel at 5:15 PM or at the room by 5:30 PM so 
 we can set up and finalize the game plan.
 After the presentation we are going to have a dinner for targeted candidates 
 and also a reception for the people who came to the presentation.  You will 
 be informed about where you need to participate on Monday; for now just keep 
 the time open.
