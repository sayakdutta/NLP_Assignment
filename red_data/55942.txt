 
 Gordon,
 
 It was a  pleasure talking to you.
 I shall ask my assistant to send you the reprint.

 Shirley, Can you, please, send a copy of the paper on credit risk management 
 (reprint from the  RISK book).
 
 
 
 
 

    
 
 Vince:
 
 Thank you very much for the useful information you provided me today.
 
 As you suggested, I wish to request a copy of the reprint that was
 published last year in Risk.
