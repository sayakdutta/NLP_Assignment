 Ladies,
 A new version of Deal Entry with a change for Australia has been moved to stage.  I have gotten concurrence from the West (Kate Symes) stating that it is ok.  I need to insure that on our side no changes have been made that impact you.  Will you please test version 3.0.0.210 at your earliest convenience to verify that.
 
 Thank you,
 Karen Y. Martin
