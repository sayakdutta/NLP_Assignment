 I have attached a new draft version of the Enron Services Agreement which 
 incorporates the changes discussed on our call and those distributed by 
 Carlos. I have also attached a blacklined version to show the changes made 
 form the previously distributed version.
 
 If you have any questions or comments please call me at (212) 558-3491. David 
 will be out of the office tomorrow but we can conference him in if we need to 
 discuss any further revisions.
 
 Regards,
 Kieran
