 Coincidentally, I will be visiting London November 9th-11th and thought I might visit Enron's offices.
 
 I am unaware of Amerax's penetration into the UK energy markets, but they are among the top three in North America.  As far as brokers go, Scott does a good job.  He is straight forward and honest and consequently was getting the largest share of our business in the west.
 
 If you are interested, I would be happy to introduce you to Scott during my trip.  My schedule is fairly flexible.

 Hi guys,
 
 We met last February when I was over in Houston and you kindly gave me some pointers as to how we in the UK can apply your experiences to the UK market.
 
 I have had a call from Scott at Amerex saying he is moving to London to set up here.
 He has said you would recommend him with a view to working our numbers here in Europe.
 
 Would you be able to comment favourably or otherwise when you get a minute?
 
 Many thanks
 
 Andy
