 
 Ben and Dennis,
 
 We do indeed appreciate being able to use the 3907 conference room for our morning meetings.  Thank you for moving your standing Wednesday staff meetings to another meeting room.  We look forward to being on the same floor with everyone!
 
 See you Thursday on EB39!

 Alicia, thanks for your patience as we attempt to acquire meeting space for our team.   Initially,  the TW Commercial Team wanted to hold its morning meetings in ECN-39C1, however, our team has decided to keep the space reserved in ECN 3907 for our morning meetings from 8:00 - 8:30a and Friday afternoon meetings from 3:00 - 3:30p.
 
 Marian Salinas, who keeps the schedule for the team rooms on the 39th floor,  noted there was a conflict only on Wednesday mornings.  Ben Asante and Leigh Ann Foret have graciously agreed to release this Wednesday morning slot for our team.  The Facility Planning/Optimization team will now meet in ECN 3998 for there weekly meetings held on Wednesdays from 8:00 - 9:00a.  
 
 I would like to take this opportunity to thank each of you for your assistance in making things happen for the TW Commercial Team.  We look forward to our upcoming move to the 39th floor on next week.
 
 Thanks again for your assistance,
 
 adr
