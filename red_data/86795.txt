 
 Kathy-
 
 I got your message.  Kali has been going to the Thursday practices, with the 
 exception of the last three weeks due to rainout, spring break and a going 
 away party for a friend.  She'll be there on this Thursday.  Do you have a 
 uniform for her?  Maybe she would feel part of the team if she gets a shirt 
 and has that for the next game.  I'll try to work on her.
 
 Thanks,
 
 Susan Pereira
