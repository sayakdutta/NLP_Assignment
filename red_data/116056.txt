 
 Does this mean that 598738 should be off peak hours as well? Because 598739 
 is only one side of a sleeve deal for EES. I would think that both sides need 
 to have the same hours......
 
 Let me know, and I'll change them accordingly.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate

 598736 and 598737 have been changed to off-peak hours. But I can't pull up 
 306927. Is this the right deal number?
