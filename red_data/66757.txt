If they want it billed on their new contract, maybe we can do an amendment.  If they want it billed on the old contracts, then you need to contact someone in the contract group to see how we bill it since the contracts are expired (i.e., overriding the CBS system or something).

 I just reviewed the handout for your presentation on the Global Settlement.  One of your slides stated that the 
 TCR surcharge is applicable for 10 years from the Global settlement, even if the CFS's contract expires.
 
 Conoco Contract Nos. 20747 & 20748 expired at the end of February.  I assume we should bill the TCR
 surcharge for these contracts beginning in March, 2002.  Please let me know if this is correct.
 
 Thanks!
