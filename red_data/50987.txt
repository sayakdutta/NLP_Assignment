 Hi Zimin!
 
 Please find attached the RPI model I developed by bootstrapping RPI swaps. 
 The structure of this particular swap is:  
 
 semi/semi Act/365F
 >
 > YOYUKRPI = (UKRPI(p-2)/UKRPI(p-14) - 1)/2
 > p = payment month
 >
 The first payment is the latest known historical RPI, February 2000. You will 
 notice that I have assumed constant cashflows between the quoted years (as 
 opposed to interpolating swaps which distorts the curve a lot).
 
 Please find below a graphic comparison between the RPI curve produced by 
 swaps and the one produced by the GILT market.
 
 
 
 Looking forward to your comments.
 
 Best regards,
 
 Martina
