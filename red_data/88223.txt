 
 Thanks for your e-mail.  I feel like our accounting dept. or contract 
 administration has somehow billed incorrectly.   I have spoke to the attorney 
 and trader and have been told you should be billed by Enron North America 
 (ECT) and not HPL.  This agreement has not been assigned to HPL. 
 
 
 I will be in touch, and hope to have this resolved on Monday.   Thanks for 
 your assistance.
