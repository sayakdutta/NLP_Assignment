 
 Jack,
 
 This is up to the MBA program. 
 I have no problem if they agreed to it.
 The only constraint is the space and we
 shall have to address the issue on Thursday
 during the first class.

 Dear Proffesor Kaminski
     I wish to audit the Energy Derivatives class which
 you are teaching on Thursday nights.  I am currently a
 second year student in the EMBA program and am
 Chairman of Nicklos Drilling Company.  Nicklos
 Drilling currently operates three land rigs along the
 Texas Gulf Coast and is constucting a fourth.  I have
 received permision from the EMBA program to audit the
 class and the only conditions would be your permission
 and space avalability.
    Thank you for your consideration,
 Jack S. Blanton, Jr.
