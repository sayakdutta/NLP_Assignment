 units installed in a facility.  Peter missed the point, and I didn't catch it 
 because I really didn't look at FV very closely at all.   Rigby caught it.  
 He disagrees with how we massaged his original language for this additional 
 guarantee, and I will try to figure out his point.

 No.  I apologize. I do not know why it was deleted.

 Pete,
 
 I'm sending you a fax regarding some changes requested by NEPCO/EECC
 (our
 affiliate).  From what he has sent me, it does not seem that the
 Fountain
 Valley contract contains the optional guarantee that is in effect for
 plants comprised of 6 or more units.  It would seem to be applicable in
 this case.  Was it deleted intentionally?
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kay
