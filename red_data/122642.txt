 
 Thank you for the notice.  I would appreciate it if you could mail my prize to my office location in the Enron Building.  I am located in ECN1346.  Thank you very much, I appreciate the effort you guys took to set up this important website. 
 
 Kim.
 
  
     
 Congratulations to each of you and thanks for subscribing to the Pipeline Safety website!  We hope to mail the portable cd players to each of you sometime next week.  I need each of you to reply to this message and send me the address where you would like the prize mailed to.  For offsite locations, we will probably be using UPS so please send a physical address rather than a P.O. Box number.  If you are in Houston and would like to just pick yours up at 3AC3185 (Kathy Willard's location), let me know so I can notify you by email.
 
 Thanks,
