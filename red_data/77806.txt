 Thanks.  I think we have alot of the same accounting issues here if the PPA 
 is construed to be a lease.  If it is a lease, we have similar spending and 
 EPC concerns as our other deals.  Do we know who the O&M contractor will be?  
 If ENA or affiliate, we should not take on plant risk - just make sure our 
 fair value O&M fee is the only amount at risk under the O&M agreement.  As of 
 Friday, AA told us that even in a non-offtake situation, they may say we are 
 in a lease if we take on plant risk through an O&M agreement.  This was new 
 news to us.
 
 
 


  
 I'm working with the commerial team on on PPA (and associated transactions) 
 for Virginia Power.  The project involves the construction of  a peaker to 
 supply some/most of the power, with the ability to supply from the market as 
 well.  The plant has an 01 service date, so things are really picking up. 
 
 Matt and Herman, this is the transaction we discussed with Heather a few 
 weeks ago.
 
 Items on the immediate to do list include:
 
 Executing a land option agreement
 Closing on the land (or assign to City of Rocky Mount, and let them close)
 Selling/transferring the land to the City of Rocky Mount; negotiate long term 
 lease
 Negotiating a PILOT agreement (payment in lieu of taxes) with the City
 Negotiating fuel supply agreements
 Selecting/contracting with EPC contractor - can it be NEPCO?
 Long lead equipment purchases (?) - could be home for LM 6000's, but other 
 equipment may be needed
 Negotiate interconnection agreement
 
 This deal is showing a lot of life, so I thought it might be helpful to give 
 you a heads up.
