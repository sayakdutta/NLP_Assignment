 
 Kathy,
 
 Please review the spreadsheet guidelines I sent.  I am having to recreate 
 your text files every night.  Specifically, the master deal id should be a 
 unique number (an NA is not acceptable here), the date must be in the d-mm-yy 
 format not a julian date format, and there can be NO commas in any numbers.
 
 Thanks,
 Robin
