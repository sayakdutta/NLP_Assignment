 RE:         Friday, May 4 meeting at 1:30 pm in the CMTA conference room
 to discuss Windfall Profits Tax bills
 
 Due to a scheduling conflict, we are changing our Thursday, 2:00 pm
 meeting to Friday, May 4 at 1:30 pm.
 
 As most of you are aware, CMTA is opposing legislation designed to
 impose a Windfall Profits Tax on electricity generator
 companies.  The bills are SBX1 1 (Soto) and ABX1 128 (Corbett).  Please
 note that the Soto bill pertains to co-generators as
 well as entities exclusively in the power business.  That means that
 many of you would be directly effected.  The other primary
 basis for opposition is that the bills would inhibit electrical supply.
 Please also note that, to the extent that SBX1 1 (Soto) were
 operative, it would impose the "windfall cost" on business taxpayers who
 would fund the credit given to personal income tax
 taxpayers.
 
 You are invited to our lobbying strategy meeting which will be here at
 CMTA's offices at 980 9th Street, Suite 2200
 on Friday, May 4 at 1:30 pm.  Please RSVP to Pam Ross at 916-498-3320 or

 
 There is a call in number as follows:
