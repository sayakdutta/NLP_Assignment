 Will this still work?  I'm not even sure what EOL is broadcasting on rvd do you know?
 
  
     
 Dave,
 
 it would be great if you guys could fix the EOL listen file before the start of cash trading (approx. one week from now). It is a lot of help and I don't know how am I gonna trade without it. :(
 
 thanks
 
 Vladi.
