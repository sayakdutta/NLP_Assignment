 Bob and Sarah,
 
 Further to our conversation on Wednesday night, we have identified the top 10-15 counterparties from both a terminated and non-terminated perspective that we want to begin working on.  Of the non-terminated, 6 are counterparties that should be sent demand letters.
 
 Shari Mao will be providing you today a list of those counterparties that owe us money and should be sent demand letters.  Lynn Shivers will be pulling these contracts as well as those for the overall top 10 to 15 and we will begin the binder process and get you copies of the contracts as soon as possible.  We will also do the credit agg check for collateral and any overlap with other commodities.
 
 Please let me know if you have any questions.
 
 Kevin
