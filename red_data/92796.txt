 
 Nancy,
 
 I've discovered a basis book with the attribute problem we corrected for the 
 Physical book below.  INTRA-EMWNSS1-BAS was set up to replace IM-EMWNSS1-BAS 
 for credit purposes.  However, the correct region code is still being applied 
 to the old book.  Here's what I need to happen.
 
 BOOK ID   CURRENT REGION CODE  CORRECT REGION CODE
 
 INTRA-EMWNSS1-BAS MIDWEST    MDWEST
 
 IM-EMWNSS1-BAS  MDWEST    MDWEST_OLD (This region code really doesn't matter 
 as long as it does not                               duplicate a currently 
 used region code.)
 
 Let me know if you have any questions.
 
 Thanks for your help,
 Robin

 Nancy,
 
 The new attributes you have assigned to the IM-EMWNSS2-PHY  book are 
 duplicating the attributes of the INTRA-EMWNSS1-PHY book.  Per my original 
 request please change the region code for IM-EMWNSS2-PHY to Midwest_Old, 
 since it is my understanding from Burton that this book should no longer be 
 used.
 
 If you have any more questions, give me a call.

 Robin:
 
 Per your request, the attributes on FT-IM-ENOV-PHY have been changed as 
 follows
 
 
 
 	Portfolio Code	Book Code	Book Type	Book Flag	Commodity	Region Code
 OLD ATTRIBUTES	1	E	M	P	NG	MIDWEST
 NEW ATTRIBUTES	P	A	M	P	NG	MIDWEST
 
 In order to prevent duplicate book attributes,  IM-EMWNSS2-PHY attributes 
 were also changed as follows:
 
 
 	Portfolio Code	Book Code	Book Type	Book Flag	Commodity	Region Code
 OLD ATTRIBUTES	P	A	M	P	NG	MIDWEST
 NEW ATTRIBUTES	P	A	M	P	NG	MIDWEST1
 
 These changes will properly report the ERMS positions in the FT-IM-ENOV-PHY 
 book as apposed to IM-EMWNSS2-PHY, which should have no positions.
 
 
 If you have any questions, please call me at ext 54751
