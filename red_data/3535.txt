 I'm asking for 20 tickets, possibly 40 depending on whether they have spouces 
 attending. Make a note for the calander. I'm thinking we can use this to get 
 people like Paul Tudor Jones, Louis Bacon, etc. to attend an Enron function, 
 while also gving the traders an opportunity to go as well.

 Hello all,
 
 Over the last few weeks correspondence has been disseminated to you in 
 regards to opportunities with the Guggenheim Museum in New York. We need to 
 get a more accurate head count if we would like to have a private Enron event 
 at the Frank Gehry Exhibit.  Tentatively, we have May 24th on hold and Frank 
 Gehry has agreed to be in attendance, which is an added-value. The event 
 would be a formal dinner with approximately 150-200 people, including Enron 
 executives and their potential/existing customers.  Again, the attendance 
 list is created through your requests but Enron Corporate covers the cost of 
 the event (excluding travel arrangements).
 
 We need to make a firm commitment to the Guggenheim by Monday.  Please let me 
 know approximately how many people you would like to bring by tomorrow. Feel 
 free to call me at 39056 or email me if you have any questions.
 
 Thanks, Margaret
