 
 Given that tonight's weather conditions may not permit dining alfresco, I was 
 wondering if we should come up with an alternative plan.  I think the first 
 order of business is whether or not we want to go some place we can eat or if 
 everyone just wants to meet up post dinner.  Depending on everyone's 
 preferences I have several suggestions.  Let me know your thoughts (regarding 
 tonight).
