 Sorry I couldn't get back to you earlier.  I  asked Tana Jones to get you 
 access to our database that keeps track of financial master agreement 
 negotiations so you will always be up to date on where we stand with the 
 process.  If you haven't heard from her, please let me know.  Any word from 
 Justin on which Enron entity we will use for trading in the U.S.?
