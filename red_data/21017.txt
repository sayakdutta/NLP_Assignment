      >
      > No man/woman is worth your tears and
      > the only one who is, will never make you cry.
      >
      > If you love someone, put their name in a
      > circle, instead of a heart, because hearts
      > can break, but circles go on forever.
      >
      > Friends listen to what you say.
      > Best friends listen to what you don't say.
      >
      > If all my friends were to jump off a
      > bridge, I wouldn't jump with them, I'd be
      > at the bottom to catch them.
      >
      > Don't frown, because you never know
      > who's falling in love with your smile!
      >
      > "If you judge people, you have no time
      > to love them." Mother Teresa
      >
      > "Be kind, for everyone you meet is
      > fighting a harder battle."
      >
      > It takes a minute to have a crush on
      > someone, an hour to like someone, and a
      > day to love someone-but it takes a
      > lifetime to forget someone.
      >
      > Enthusiasm is contagious. You could start an epidemic!
      > Yesterday is the past, tomorrow is
      > the future. Today is a gift, that is why
      > we call it the present.
      >
      > Send this to everyone you will never
      > forget, and send it back to the person
      > who sent it to you, too, just to show them
      > that you will never forget them.
      >
      > If you don't send it back, it means that you are
      > not a true friend.
      > So send it to everyone that you never will forget.
