 Rex, I sent the other document for those folks back to them the middle or last of last week by Fed Ex.  I sent it to Elaine Esparza.  I wonder if she has checked with Elaine Esparza.  By copy of this e-mail, I am asking her to call Elaine Esparza.  Thanks for looking, Rex.  S
 
  
     
 Steph:  I thought we already signed off on everything that related to Enron Wind, but I will check and see.   Thanks, Rex

 Rex, we don't have this up here in Mr. Derrick's office.  Do you think this would be one of the documents we have sent to you for approval?  Thanks, S

 Hello James, 
 
 
 Near the end of July Oscar Ballesteros asked me to sent the Annual Accounts for TEE for signature to Adam Umanoff, because Herbert Peels was on vacation. 
 
 After Adam?s signature, he sent the documents to you directly. Do you have the documents yet? 
 
 If you have the documents, please could you sign them and send them  to Herbert Peels as soon as possible. 
 
 Thank you for your help in advance 
 
 
 Best regards 
 
 Veronika Zimmermann
