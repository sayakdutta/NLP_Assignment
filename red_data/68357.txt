 Phillip - the bankruptcy books that you requested this morning have been set up in RisktRAC and ERMS.  I have given the East, Central, West, Texas and Financial desks access to these books.  Keep in mind that these books have not been placed in the RisktRAC hierarchy.  Please advise as to where they need to be placed.
 
 Thank you,
