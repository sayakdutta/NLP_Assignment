 
 Brad, as I am cleaning out Jeff's e-mails, I came across this one from you.  
 It appears to me that it has not been opened, so I'm checking to find out if 
 you got the answer to your question.  Please let me know, and I'll try to get 
 the information for you.  If we dropped the ball on this, I apologize.

 Mr Skilling,
 
 During the All Company meeting you mentioned the warehouse location on North 
 Shepard where the
 Broadband equipment was being assembled.
 
 I and a couple of others would like to visit it. This would be useful to us 
 who are responsible for categorizing 
 types of material and getting them in the SAP Material Master via the Aspect 
 Corporate Catalog.
 
 Who can provide us the street address and allow us to visit?
 
 Thanks,
  Brad Noble
