 The Board meeting is confirmed for tomorrow, Sunday, Nov. 4, at 3 p.m. CST in the Board Room.  Most of our Board will be here in Houston.  If you are not available and would like to call in, please contact me (either at the office or via cell phone at 713 962 2109).  Ken may chose to hold an executive session at the beginning and the end of the meeting, but at this time I expect the business discussion to be an open session if you chose to attend.  'Will keep you advised if that changes.  Thanks, Paula
