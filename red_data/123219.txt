 At the end of the Leadership Giving Campaign, EWS had reached $488,832 in pledges, which is 38.31% of our campaign goal of $1,276,000.  Enron's plan calls for Leadership Givers to represent 60% of the total pledge goal, so we are short 21.69% or $276,768.  Even more disappointing was the weak 7.85% participation rate by those employees in the Leadership level (i.e., over $90,000 in base pay).  While part of this shortfall was caused by the decision not to conduct a Leadership campaign for EBS, most of the other business units/functional groups in EWS did not fare too well either.  
 
 Below are the pledge totals and participation rates by functional group:
 
 	GROUP			PLEDGES	% Participation
 	EA			$79,485		10.78%
 	EBS			$14,555		1.31%
 	EEOS			$32,143		18.18%
 	EEL			$6,104		14.29%
 	EGM			$74,030		11.53%
 	EIM			$62,567		21.62%
 	ENW			$77,960		3.82%
 	EWS Bus. Analysis	$25,024		12.84%
 	EWS Bus. Dev.		$13,438		75.00%
 	EWS HR		$6,985		8.33%
 	EWS Legal		$38,800		20.65%
 	EWS Research		$19,080		23.40%
 	EWS Treasury		$13,661		71.43%
 	EWS TOTAL		$488,832	7.85%
 
 From a corporate perspective, EWS is tracking fairly closely to the others.  Here are the other groups' totals:
 
 	ETS			$146,466	12.92%
 	Corporate		$359,925	10.07%
 	EES			$131,439	6.56%
