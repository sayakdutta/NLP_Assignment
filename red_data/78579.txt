    As I told you last week, I will be on vacation tomorrow and all
 of next week.  I will be checking my voice-mail at least twice a day. In
 addition, if I can get my lap-top to work, I will also be checking my
 e-mail on a regular basis.  If you need immediate assistance, please
 contact Chris Cobb at (202) 662-2016. Hope all goes well with Salmon
 Energy and LV Cogen.
