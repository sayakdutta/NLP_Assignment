 Richard,? Could you get a letter off by fax this week to Erica Tamblyn, 
 Administrator, at Milbank Los Angeles (1) advising her that you want me to 
 handle the Farallon (35509-00300) and Legg Mason (35509-00400) cases at my 
 new firm, Alschuler, Grossman, Stein & Kahan, along with continuing 
 participation by Roland Tellis at Milbank, and (2) requesting that Ms. 
 Tamblyn transfer to Alschuler such of the files in the two cases as I may 
 from time to time direct.? Milbank needs to get this letter before they can 
 transfer any of the files to me at my new firm.
 
 Call me if you have any questions.? Thanks. 
 
 Steve
