 
 They are looking at trading advertising time.  Ed Ondarza may be the guy.  
 I'd be happy to introduce you to him, if you'd like.

 okay-i have a question-have you heard anything about a new group in Broadband 
 that will be trading commercial air time?
 I believe it involves Edward Andarza and some other guy named Ben Freeman. I 
 thought it might be of interest to someone with 
 a communications background, that purchased television air time.....
 
 thanks-Kim
