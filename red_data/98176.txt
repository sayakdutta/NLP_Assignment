 to check w/ the client/trader to see how strongly they feel about letting it 
 go. We have a lot of dog cases out there that someone feels strongly about. 
 Any word Harry?

 Richard, I got your voice-mail, to the effect that you did not want to pursue 
 this matter.  Should I close this file?  Just let me know.
