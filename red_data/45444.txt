 
 I just had this conv. w/Mark and Marcus Nettleton today about parties acting 
 as agent, or in some fiduciary capacity online.  What I am being told is that 
 the system is set up for parties to only act as principals for online 
 trading.  It does not deal with agent, fiduciary or similar relationships.  
 The only exception to this rule so far has been GPU where they had an agency 
 relationship with 3 utilities, on the power side, where Leslie had some 
 specific documentation that she got signed.  But I am told should not be 
 entering into transactions with counterparties as anything other than 
 principals, except under extraordinary circumstances.

 "Ameren Energy, Inc. as agent":  On hold til I speak with Leslie. I imagine 
 they will need to sign our std. Consent & Acknowledgement form which allows 
 them act as agent. It would be helpful to know for whom they are acting as 
 agent. Do you know this?
