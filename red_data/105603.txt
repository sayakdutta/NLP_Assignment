 In the midst of leaving my voice mail, I think I realized my error.  
 I believe that a guarantor can be a "corporation,....entity" having total 
 asssts exceeding $10million.  However, that subpart (I) guarantor cannot be 
 one that falls into the subpart (III) category (which is different from the 
 prior law).
