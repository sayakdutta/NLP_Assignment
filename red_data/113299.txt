 Charles:
 Havey Reed of Constellation and Mike Prosser of El Paso are MAIN Board members whose terms are not expiring this year.  I think that is adequate coverage for marketers.  If MAIN becomes the security coordinator for the Alliance companies that have departed
 Ameren, CE, and IP then I expect MAIN to continue in business for some time,

 I would be more cautious than Dave.  We do not know who and what MAIN will be after RTOs and the new NAERO are up and running.  If MAIN and the other Regions are irrelevant, then being on the Board could help the cause to make them go away.  If possible, a better approach would be to maintain the need for marketers to be on the Board - if we cannot support putting an actual person on it.

 I am not a huge reliability region guy....Charles may have a view.  The only concern i have is that the ISO's and reliability regions are not discussing how to manage the transition of authority given the ISO's responsibility for reliability.  I am starting to present this issue to the various enties....so, i agree with Dave but would like Charles comment as well
 
 regards
 Mike
 
  
     
 
 Do you agree?

 I don't believe Enron needs to be represented directly on the MAIN Board.   Too much time and money for the value received in my opinion.
