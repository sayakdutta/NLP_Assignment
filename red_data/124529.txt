Jo and I are going to mom's on Thursday, then we are going to visit her grandparents over the weekend.  We are not going to the game, but we will be watching it on TV.  It doesn't look good for A&M because we got some key guys that are injured, hopefully we can make it a close game.  Have a safe trip and say hi to mimi for me. Talk to you soon. - Jason  
 
  
     
 Hi Jason,
 First of all, just want to wish you Joanna a happy thanksgiving.  We certainly have a lot to be thankful for.  Susan and I are leaving tonight visit her dad.  I'm going up to Wisconsin to visit Mimi in two weeks.  She still sound very tired.
 Hear a lot of stuff about Enron.  I hope you are still doing OK.  I'm sure you've created value for yourself and should be fine.  It is just amazing to see a company that size make the mistakes that it did. But, the bottom line is that it is run by humans.  And that is how we learn.
 Are you going to the game on Friday?  It would be great to see A&M pull out a win.
 Love,
 Dad
