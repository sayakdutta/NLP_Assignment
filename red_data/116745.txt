 
 I've left a message for Mike Swerzbin, the trader on these deals. They're 
 both in Enpower the way they're in his trade log, so I don't want to change 
 anything until I talk to him. I'm also going to call Judy Dyer at EES for 
 confirmation on the 517876 price. I'll let you know.
 
 Thanks,
 Kate

 Hi Kate,
 
 for ref 517891 the delivery point still shows as PV.........it should be SP-15
 for ref 517876 the price stll shows $300....it should be $313
 
 
 
 
 
 

 
   
  
 517384 - price has been changed to $260
 517891 - mike's book shows Palo delivery - desk was wrong - has been changed 
 to LTNW
 517884 - price has been changed to $300
 517876/877 - missing Amerex deals were under wrong desk (STCA) - have been 
 changed to LTNW
 
 Also, I entered many of Mike's deals today, but in my rush forgot to re-set 
 my Deal Blotter defaults - so the deals went in under Short Term California 
 instead of Long Term Northwest. I've changed them all to the correct desk, 
 which should clear up the missing deals, and hopefully will make more sense 
 for your checkouts. Sorry about the confusion - entering deals for three 
 different desks at once gets a little hectic!
 
 Let me know if you have questions.
 
 Kate
