 Have you decided who will be assisting tax-wise for these two countries?
 
 I have a conference call this afternoon at 3 pm (Houston time) with Antonio 
 Felix de Araujo Cintra from the Tozzini firm regarding further research on 
 derivative products for trading in Brazil.  Attached is a summary of products 
 and the various Enron groups seeking answers.  If you would like to 
 participate in person or by conference, please let me know.
 
 I will be in Sao Paulo from Sept 20-22 and Buenos Aires from Sept 23-24.  In 
 Brazil, I will be meeting again with Tozzini lawyers.  In BA, I'll be meeting 
 with Marval lawyers.  Let me know if you would like to participate in any way.
