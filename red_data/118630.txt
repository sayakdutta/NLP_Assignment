 
 Thank you very much - can I get a copy of the Risk article?  
 
 The BIS numbers unfortunately do not distinguish which of the commodity 
 numbers are applicable to energy, and worse yet they include only numbers 
 from reporting banks.  In the energy area a large proportion of the 
 transactions are by non-bank institutions -this makes finding the numbers 
 much harder because companies like Enron are not required to publicly 
 disclose their positions.  Hopefully the Risk article has some numbers but if 
 you can find anything else specifically relating to the size of the energy 
 derivatives markets that would be helpful.

 Mark,
 
 I found an article in Risk, April 1999 titled "Banking on energy derivatives: 
 Brokers are acting more and more like investment banks, designing structured 
 trades and bundled risk management solutions.  Nowhere is the trend more 
 clear than in the energy markets."   Also,  the attached reports describe the 
 OTC market.  Please let me know where to go from here.
