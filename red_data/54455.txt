 
 Rick,
 
 I want to bring  Aram Sogomonian back to Enron at s VP level.
 According to new human resources procedures this decision requires
 a support of three senior executives.
 
 I want to ask you to express your opinion on Aram (based on a phone interview
 or just on your past interactions with him). You can send a reply to Norma 
 Villarreal at H/R.
 
 Thanks.
 
 Vince
