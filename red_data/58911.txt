 Good afternoon Mr Kean,
 
 The reason for contacting you today is that I am currently working a senior
 US executive based in the UK.  I am confident he could prove to be a
 valuable asset to the Enron Corporation.
 
 Currently residing in London, he is now looking to make a career move which
 will utilise his honed management style, and experience of developing
 commercial business.  
 
 At the moment he is the Group Managing Director of Europe's largest Telecoms
 Support business which has a turnover in excess of ?1 billion.
 
 You were in a meeting yesterday evening,  but I wanted to investigate
 whether you would like to see a narrative profile of this gentleman.
 
 Your initial thoughts would be most welcome, I look forward to hearing from
 you at your convenience.
 
 
 kind regards,
 Darren Walsh
