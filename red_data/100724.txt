 probably muster up the energy.  Besides, I'm planning on sleeping the entire 
 way out there so I'll end up getting more sleep that night than normal.  Do I 
 need to do anything to sign up for the run?

 any chance you'd be up for an 8K run on saturday?? only problem is that it 
 starts at 8:00am- too painful after your late night?? no obligation.....

 Okay...My itinerary is as follows:? Arriving in San Diego 2:20 am Friday
 night (I'll need your new address for the cab) and departing Sunday at 6:15
 pm.? If you just want to leave the key under the mat that would be perfect
 for me...I'll probably crash immediately anyway.? I am so excited to be
 coming out there - -? I really need a break from Houston...not to mention
 work.? The Gas Lamp district Saturday night sounds like fun and I would
 love to meet your friends.? Also, please don't feel like you have to plan
 the whole weekend, I have no problem going with the flow.
 
 See you in a couple of weeks,
 Susan
