 What are you doing with my inheritance?  We enjoyed the dinner as well.  We 
 are available whenever you would like to join us.  We should do it at least 
 bi-weekly.
 Work is good - I have had a pretty good month thus far (knock on wood).  
 
 How are things going with you?
 
 Your loving son,

 Hi Eric,
 
 We sure enjoyed being with you and your lovely Shanna Friday evening.  We
 should do that more often.  How is your day going?  Work real hard because
 we've lost all of your inheritance.  LU-M
