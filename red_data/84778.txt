 You can still get in on the trip if your interested.
 
 How did Lisa take the Red Raider butt whipping?  Give her my condolences.
 
 
 
 
 
 

    
 
 
 G,
 
 The game was great but actually boring. I got the tickets and will mail you
 a check for $100. We are organizing a trip to the Big XII Championship on
 Dec. 4. I will give you details later. Did you pass your scuba class?
