 
 I just tried to call you, I couldn't get through.  What are you discussing 
 with Carr?  Is this just for them to enter into an BETA, or something else?  
 Also, do you want a bilateral agreement?  Who will be providing the 
 confidential information?  It shouldn't take me too long to draft you and NDA 
 once I get this info.  I'll email it to the counterparty and copy you in on 
 the email.  Of course, we have to get it signed here in Houston, so time is 
 of the essence...
