 I just converted and moved Larry Campbell (lcampbe) to the W2K server.  He 
 uses ESIS.  I successfully converted the tables and have the links corrected 
 (logged in as kgramse), however Larry cannot use the system.  I received a 
 message while logged in as Larry stating that the data/application was 
 "Read-Only" when I attempted to re-link the tables.  
 
 Please check the permissions on GTROS-FS01P\APPSRW 
 
 Thanks,
 
 Kerry
