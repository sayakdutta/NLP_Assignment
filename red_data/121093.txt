 
 Jim,
 
 I am very interested in supplying your gas and plan on responding to your request for qualification.  If there is anything else that you need in the meantime, please give me a call.
 
 Thanks,

   Kim: I just wanted to touch base to see if you received the RFP. I am
 trying to see who is interested
           in our gas service at this time for next September. Thanks.
