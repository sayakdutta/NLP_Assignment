 
 Since I have my long vacation in January, the less time I have to take off, the better - so I think a long holiday weekend would be good.  Let me know!

 Ok, Ladies,
 
 John Tlapek called tonight....we discussed a ski trip....he wanted me to ask
 everyone for an alternative time to go, other than New Year's Eve......
 
 Will each of you email me weekends in Dec/Feb/Mch, that you are currently
 available...and I will match them together for
 all 5 of us...and provide John w/ one or two dates...
 
 THANKS, TAKE CARE,
 TRICIA
