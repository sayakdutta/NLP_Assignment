 
 Forgive me.  Can't recall if I already responded. Not sure if there's a simple, concise summary ("concise" just doesn't seem compatible with CA's siting process), but let me do a little poking around and get back to you.
 
 Best,
 Jef
 
 

  
 
 Jeff,
 
 My colleague Joel Schwartz and I are looking for a concise summary of
 the typical siting/permitting process for a plant in California,
 including steps in the process, number of agencies, and average length.
 Any ideas?
 
 Thanks again for your great remarks last Friday; I really appreciated
 them.
 
 Regards, Lynne
