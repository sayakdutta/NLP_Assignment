 I made a few changes.  Generally when creating a resume, shorter is better
 (preferably fitting on one page).  So most of my changes have been
 consolidations.  Also, I tried to make the tenses of all of your bullet

 As a side note, Shanna and I would like to take you and Donnita to dinner
 on Friday at Pappasitos.  Can you make it?

 Would you do me a favor and look this over and tell  me things I should
 change? Please send it back to this address. You  can make the changes in
 the document and send the changed document back.   Thanks.
