 thanks.

 Rika & Alan I have attached a document that has some additional changes that Kevin would like.
 
 Also Rika please consider gather a couple of your powerusers and we can review this app for other refinements.
 
 Alan can you look at the interchange cube as 2002 is not showing up.
 
 Thanks.

 Please ensure that real-time prices for ERCOT, PJM, NY, and NEPOOL are added to the cube database.   I have been analyzing the data today and the real-time clearing prices are not there.
 
 Thanks.
