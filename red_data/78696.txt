 
 I'm sure Friday will work well.  It should be quiet at work since it will be 
 Good Friday.
 
 I know your pictures will be spectacular.

 Kay, I just talked to Dan and told him we were both 
 puny.  We have tentatively rescheduled for Friday.  How 
 does that look for you?  He said to PLEASE hurry and get 
 well. I feel so needed!
 
 Oh, we went to Brenham and shot some bluebonnet pics 
 yesterday.  I hope they come out good.  Linda Simmons 
 has been requesting them for a while now.  Did you see 
 the Masters golf tournament. Tiger won and it was 
 exciting.  I never thought I would actually like 
 watching golf.  
 
 Get to feeling better!
