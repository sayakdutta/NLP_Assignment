 
 Jeff has both sides of both deals in the system correctly. Here are the deal 
 numbers.
 
 461029
 Williams
 115.00
 
 461030
 EES
 114.95
 
 461801
 Mieco
 115.00
 
 461802
 EES
 114.95
 
 And Deal #461139 was actually a Short Term Southwest deal done by Tom Alonso 
 with Williams for the same price on the same days, but with Prebon. 
 Confusion! 
 
 Hope this fixes it.
