 We have a mutual friend, Natasha Sims.  Natasha and I attend the same church 
 and sing in the choir together, and we were talking yesterday about Mary Kay 
 products and she told me that you are her rep and that we work at the same 
 place.  What a coincidence!  To top it all off, I received an e-mail from 
 Angie Collins and your name was also on the e-mail, so I said, "I have got to 
 send her an e-mail".  Well, anyway, I would like to order some products.
 
 I would like the cleanser for normal skin, a concealer in the ebony bronze, 
 and a black liquid eyeliner.  Please let me know if you have these items in 
 stock and what the charge is an when we can hook up!
 
   Thank you so much.
