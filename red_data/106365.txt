 request with an address.  It should match (we'll need to check) the master 
 agreement address.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

 Hello Elliot, 
 Sorry I couldn't get back with you until now.  Either I am out of the office 
 or in meetings all day.  Last we spoke you were going to send me a copy of 
 the previous agreed upon ISDA between Heinz and Enron.  I believe you wanted 
 our legal contact but is there anyway you can send the copy to my attention.  
 I would like to have a copy for my files.  
 We have not made a decision yet on linerboard swaps.  I have a meeting with 
 my General Manager on Monday PM and hope to know more.  
 Can you please send me a copy of the ISDA prior to Monday PM? 
 Thanks,

     Have you made a decision on this swap yet?  Please let me know either way. 
 Thanks.

                Hi Elliott, 
    I talked with Corby and today we have an offer around $428/ton for 2 
    years 5,000 tons.  Can you provide a better offer that we could discuss? 
    Thanks,
