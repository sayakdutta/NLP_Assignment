 Yat-teh-hey,
 
 The attached two files are the monthly activity list and an updated tribe
 roster.
 
  <<Indian Guides Activities 2000-2001.doc>>   <<Indian Guides Roster.xls>>
 
 These files are in Microsoft Word and Excel.   Let me know if you are not
 able to open these files.
 
 
 Lew Tenhave and Ed Fallick,
 
 The two of you are responsible for the September activity. (Stratford High
 School Football Game)  I am not sure but you may also be the "Co-Chief's"
 for 2001-2002, I will have to check the pow-wow minutes.
 
 What-the-heck
