 
 That sounds really interesting.  Let me see if I can change one appointment 
 to make it work.
 
 Thanks,

 Kay,
 
 I am back at the plate for another shot at your schedule.  There is a 
 Distinguished Speaker Luncheon this Thursday at noon at the Houston Club 
 featuring Larry Dierker, Milo Hamilton and Jerry Hunsicker of the Houston 
 Astros.  Could you please be a guest at our table?  Hawaiian shirts are 
 required.
 
 Let me know.  Hope you can make it.
