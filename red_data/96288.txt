 Attached is the draft memo. After you have had a chance to review, please 
 call me with your thoughts/comments.  I would also like to briefly speak with 
 John Klauberg about "East Coast" municipalities to make sure he thinks this 
 policy works in the east as well.  John is going to call me early this 
 afternoon.  Also, to the extent you think we should highlight financial 
 trading policies like I have done, I would like Mark to review what is 
 written (he did confirm that this is financial trading's policy).  Finally, 
 it would be very helpful if I could get your thoughts on to whom we should 
 distribute the memo.
 
 
 
 Thanks
 Elizabeth
