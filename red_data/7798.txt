 
 The draft of the memo looks good.  However, your memo says that the memo will 
 be sent to all US employees of ENA.  ENA by definition includes Canada and 
 Mexico.  Therefore, please send the memo to all ENA employees, not just those 
 in the US.  Several of those referenced in the memo as being promoted work in 
 our Calgary office, so the memo should certainly be sent to those employees 
 in Calgary.  I am at x35926 if you have any questions.
