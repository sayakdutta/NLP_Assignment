 1. Marshall Law
 2. Nationalize the grid.
 3. International energy crimes trial.

 No rumors from the AB 1890 group either.  Seems like the plan is being

 The Governor obviously picked Dec 1 so they could review everyone's filings 
 from the 22nd.  I've asked our lobbying firm -- governmental Advocates -- to 
 see what they can find out about the plan.  I haven't even heard any rumors.
