 The only restriction is coming from our cautious, power credit team wanting 
 to only sell to BPA at this time.  
 
  
     
 Taking a look at BPA from the 3/8/01 list, I noticed that we've got them 
 opened up for west coast power only on the offer and not the bid.  I have no 
 notes that they are restricted in that manner.  What's the scoop?  Marcus, do 
 you see any reason they should be restricted to the offer side?
