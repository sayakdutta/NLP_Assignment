 
 Ellen,
  You are correct.  I do not have the information at this time.  Can you 
 execute without the information.  I will get Enovate to fill in the 
 information when I send them the contracts for their signature.    Dan

 Dan, the only thing I'm missing on the Enovate contract is the
 notices/billing/payment page.  If you want to just email me the info, I'll
 plug it in.
 
 Thanks so much for your help.

 Ellen,
      I received your voice mail and your email this morning.  I made each
 of the changes from your email to the two contract documents.  Please
 review and if acceptable, please start the execution process by printing
 two originals of each document.  Once signed by Reliant, please forward to
 me and I will have ENA sign their contract and I will attempt to get
 Enovate to sign and return their contract and the two transaction
 agreements to me for forwarding one fully set to you.  Please call if you
 have any questions.  My phone number is (713)853-6895.
