 Thank you.  Karen
 
 I'll buy you a drink at the law conference.
 
 
 
     
 The ISDA Agreement is not in electronic form.  I will send you over a clean 
 version.

 Tana --
 
 Do you have an electronic version of the ISDA Agreement?  If not, a good, 
 clean version I can have copied for my new expanding library?
 
 Again, I really appreciate your help.  Karen
