 Great job gentlemen!  This deviation shows that Eco definitely has a 
 significant amount of option value which can be exploited with quick 
 reactions and favourable market movements.

 Finally completed tonight
 
 Net to Enron LNG Marketing Company - $ 272,000 ( $0.10/ mmbtu )
 Net to Eco  about $3,300,000   ( Enron 50% share about $ 1,650,000 )
 
 Enron total gain not counting  ENA's trading desk margin is $1,922,000 
 
 Not bad for a single cargo.
