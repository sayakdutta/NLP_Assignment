 problems."

 My recollection is that this sheet is a bit vague on detail.
 
 California's gas problems are twofold:
 
 Wellhead prices are still high.  CERA is the best place to get more data on 
 drilling activity, etc.
 
 Instate capacity is tigh in PG&E and SDG&E.  CEC did a study, no?  In any 
 event California utiilties probably have plans to eliminate the bottlenecks.
