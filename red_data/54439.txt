 Tanya,
                We care about PORTFOLIO VALUE CHANGES, not log-returns of a 
 single contract, which has extremes in the behavior and can be fit to a 
 fat-tailed distribution.   A 1.20 basis move, with 500 BCF position, is an 
 extreme event, anyway you slice it.In the literature, as elsewhere, I agree 
 for a single contract log-returns, they don't divide by vols.

 Naveen

 Naveen,
 
 I got NGI-SOCAL prices for prompt, prompt+1,...,prompt+59 contracts.
 For each contract I calculated moving average based on 21 log-returns as
 well as moving volatility. Then I calculated normalized log-returns:
 
 [ return(t)-ave(t) ] / vol(t)
 
 and compared the results to normal distribution. 
 
 I COULD NOT FIND Fat Tails! 
 
 Volatility changes a lot from day to day, so when people look at
 log-returns (not normalized) it seems that there fat tails (big spikes, large 
 returns more frequent than normal), 
 which comes from the fact that volatility is not constant (at all).
