 
 Hey thanks for the Thanksgiving invitation!   I thought I would die from exhaustion if I had to drop one more hint.  I'll either whip up one of my famous gourmet dishes or stop off at the liquor store for wine, and if I do bring wine it will be the very best box wine 7/11 has to offer.  But in either case I will not be bringing any of my hotties, I'm having them all sent out for chemical bathes so they will be clean for the holidays.
 
 Thanks Again
 
 Paul
 
 
 PS  At dinner, see if you can seat me next to Nadine, I'll owe you!
