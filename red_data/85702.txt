 We have received inquiries from several attorneys who attended only the Thu=

 e not already contacted someone about CLE credit for Thursday,  please send=
  an e-mail to Becky Zikes stating that you attended the Thursday session.  =
 This will enable you to claim 3.50 hours total credit, with 1.25 hours ethi=
 cs credit for Thursday.  If you have any questions, please contact Becky Zi=
 kes at 3-1843, or Diane Goode at 5-7103.   Please respond by Thursday, May =
 31 since we need to finalize our CLE filings with the various state bar org=
 anizations.=20
 
 
 If you wish to receive CPE credit (for certified public accountants) for th=
 e Law Conference, please  send an e-mail to Becky Zikes and we will get the=
  appropriate certificate prepared.  Again, any questions should be directed=
  to Becky Zikes at 3-1843, or Diane Goode at 5-7103.=20
