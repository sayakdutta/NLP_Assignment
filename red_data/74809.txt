 
 Is that a general offer to help, or just an offer to help me find the Blue 
 Dog contract? 
 
 
    
 	
 	
 	 	
 
   
  
 
 Kay:
 
 Sheila asked me (told me, really) to ask you for a copy of the most recent 
 version of the Blue Dog Turbine Agreement.
 
 Just let me know what, if anything, I can do to help you out.
