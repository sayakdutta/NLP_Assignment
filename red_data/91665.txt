 Bob,
 
 sounds good, but the page you sent me doesn't work, maybe i need a cookie or it's only temporary.  what are the 
 basic specs?

 Cooper -
 
 I thought that you might be interested in an update to our web server activities...
 
 Our plan (at this point) is to purchase a new production server and keep the existing system as the development server and file server.
 
 This is what we are looking at:

 We are planning to purchase two of these (identical of course). We plan to have one mirror the other so the we can balance the load, and also so that (in the event of a problem) one can function independent of the other... the idea the we can literally shut one down without the web site going down is exciting... also, being able to upgrade by simply slapping in a new "pizza box" is quite intriguing...
 
 Any comments that you might have are more than welcome.
 
 Bob
