 
 Andrea,
 
 Brian and I were talking about the dissemination of this policy.  It seems as 
 if it should come from your group and go out globally.  What do you think?

 Attached is a revised draft of the Employee Data Protection Policy, which is 
 required because of directives by the European Union.
 
 Please provide me with any questions or comments on this policy.
 
 I would appreciate any comments by Monday, September 11, 2000 so that this 
 policy can be rolled out quickly.
 
 Thank you.
 
 Michelle Cash
