 The business that Thomas D. Gros is building for Enron remains untested.
  But his entire career seems to have been aimed at the opportunity. 
 
  He studied aerospace engineering, worked as an analyst for the Central
  Intelligence Agency, earned an M.B.A. and set up a natural-gas trading
  operation -- competing against Enron -- for British Petroleum. He also did a
  stint on Wall Street with Chemical Bank.
