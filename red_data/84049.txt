 
 G,   
 
 I was thinking of bringing along a friend from Enron to the boat party.  
 Unfortunately he is not a female so this may throw off your proper party 
 ratio.  He is married though so he will leave the single girls alone for you 
 and me.  His wife is out of town this weekend.  He won't mind sleeping on the 
 floor.  
 
 Thanks for letting me hang at your place this weekend.  Lisa is a really cool 
 girl.  You two will have fun together.
