 Steve,
 
 SDG&E came out with the attached RFP for fixed price power.  They are 
 requesting proposals for several standard blocks through 12/03.  Responses 
 are due August 30.  ENA/EPMI will be prepared to respond, if appropriate.  In 
 the meantime, we continue to price the full requirements residential 
 structure and await any news from the governor's office/legislature.  I can 
 be reached at 503-464-3735.
 
 Regards,
 
 Chris
