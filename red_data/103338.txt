 for cross default purposes under Section 5(a)(vi) of the ISDA boilerplate by 
 reference to outstanding loans ("obligations for the payment of money", i.e., 
 "Specified Indebtedness" in Section 14 of the ISDA boilerplate).  Credit sets 
 the threshold level and we input that number into the document.
 
 (2)  Susan Bailey will send you the ISDA Master Agreement boilerplate.  Her 
 number is X34737.
 
 SUSAN:  Please send Davis the ISDA boilerplate (no CSA).  Thanks.  Sara

 Laurel,
 
 As we discussed on the phone, the floating rate day count convention should 
 be Actual/360.
 
 Sara, could you easily explain what the Threshold Amount means in Annex B?  I 
 tried to look it up on the web but couldn't find anything.  Additionally, if 
 you have an extra copy of ISDA up there, I might like to have a copy (hope 
 you don't hurt yourself laughing...).
 
 Thanks & regards,
 Davis
