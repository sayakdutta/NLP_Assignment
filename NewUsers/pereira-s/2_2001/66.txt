Helen-

I don't think we will be able to do group lessons during the week, but, just 
for grins, what is the time of the Tuesday afternoon class?  How many kids 
are in the class and who is the instructor?  Also, are there any group 
lessons on the weekends that my daughter Kali might participate in?  Are the 
classes large?

Thanks,

Susan Pereira
