Thanks.  See you on Thursday.

We have a shirt and we really want her to be a part of the team- I know that
the format -- with practices with 2 teams combined with Spring Break and bad
weather have made it a little difficult to have the same feeling that we all
did with our little micro teams but I know she would like the other girls on
the team and have fun! I'll make sure Roy brings her shirt to practice on
Thursday. Thanks for letting me know about this and we''ll work together to
amok this fun for her! Kathy
