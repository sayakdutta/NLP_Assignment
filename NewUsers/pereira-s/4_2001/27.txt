Susan,

I hear you are covering for Andy Ring the next couple of weeks.....

We only had two NYMEX match-ups for April, one with ABG Gas Supply (sitara 
#700336) and one with El Paso Merchant.
Andy entered them in Sitara, and I was able to find the deal with ABG Gas 
Supply, but can not find the deal with El Paso.
Could you or somebody in your group possibly find the relevant deal-number ?

I appreciate your help !

Regards,
Ellen
