Chicago Team -
Recruiting season has begun and you will be receiving weekly updates from me about the status of events at Chicago.

Last week Mitch Taylor gave a presentation about the energy industry and Enron's position in it to the first years.  It was a great turn out and I have received several emails about how great the presentation was.



Below are the upcoming events and the participants I have scheduled for each event.  As you can see, we still need some people in key places.  Please let me know if you are available.  If your calendar has changed, please notify me as soon as possible so we can find a replacement.  Otherwise, you will receive an event sheet one week prior to the event with hotel confirmation numbers and other details.  Please let me know if you have any suggestions or questions.
