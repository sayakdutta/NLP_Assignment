David-

I got the email you forwarded to me.  Have you responded to Suzanne 
Sugarbaker yet?  I would be happy(?) to talk with her, so please feel free to 
forward my email address to her.  If I don't hear back from you today, I will 
probably email Suzanne directly this weekend.  Maybe I can clarify a few 
issues with her.  As for Cindy Colvin's "presentation," I've spoken with 
Richard Rothfelder on how we might handle future situations like this.  In 
the meantime, I'm taking extra vitamins to thicken my skin.  

Let me know what responses you receive today on the RFP.  I know we will need 
to schedule a committee meeting in the next week or so.

Thanks,

Susan

P.S.-
Please email me back today at our home email address :
