Looks fine, Jan.  Thanks for taking care of this for us.  Let me know the 
exact amount if the exchange rate changes.  I'll give a check to Papi to 
deposit in your account.  

I hope you are all doing well.  Maman told us of your struggles to get the 
medication you need.  I hope things work out.  How are the kids doing?  Kali 
and Michael are very excited that school is almost out--just two more weeks.  
They can't wait for Alexia and Sebastien to get here.

See you soon..

Love,

Susan
