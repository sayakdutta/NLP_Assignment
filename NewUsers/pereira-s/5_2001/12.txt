Thanks.  Let me know where I can send the $6.

Sorry that Kali didn't enjoy the season -- maybe one sport at one time is  
enough. I will l send her the trophy since it has already been ordered. I  
don't know about the U-10 coaches since Mary is playing HYSA next season.  
Hope it works out better for you all! Kathy Harrison
