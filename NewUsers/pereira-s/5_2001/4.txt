The 22nd or 24th would work better for me.  Please check with the others on 
which day is more convenient.

Thanks,

Susan:

Staff has received the following RFP documents.

Civic Design
Wilbur Smith Associates
Vernon G. Henry and Associates

I will be leaving you a copy of the RFP at your house this evening.

As three days is required for public posting, staff would like to schedule a
meeting of members to review and score the written proposals.

Would you be available on May 21, 22 or 24?  A budget workshop with council
is scheduled for May 23.

Interviews are scheduled for May 29.

Please advise staff as to these available dates for you.  I would be more
than happy to e-mail the other members based upon your comments.
