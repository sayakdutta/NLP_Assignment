I expect us to file bankruptcy today or tomorrow.  We will likely be defaulting on a lot of our December business.  There are some last ditch efforts going on, but I'm not very hopeful.  If we file bankruptcy, I think we'll all get at least 60 days pay.  There were supposed to be layoffs this week anyway.  I guess those will happen.  I don't know.  They may wait until we file bankruptcy and see what the bankruptcy court judge wants the company to do first.  Stay tuned....

 

Dear Susan

What's happening now?  It's all over the international news that Enron will
not make it.  what are they saying to the employees?

Thinking about you!
