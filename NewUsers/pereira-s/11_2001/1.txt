I think we've got the prices right in our system now.

Susan,

I don't know if you have talked to Tricia Troung since you left me a
message Friday.  I agree with what you said, the average of the three
prices, plus $.01.  However the invoice, which Tricia says is what's in the
"system"  pays us on each of the prices(three different prices), for
different volumes.  Not equal volumes,  but  a graduated scale.

Thank you,

Stevens
