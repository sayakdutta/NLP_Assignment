Dear Mr. Farley-

I am writing to request that West U postpone its work at Colonial Park until late May 2002.  Over 50 girls involved in the West U Softball Association practice at the field at Colonial Park from February through May every year.  If not allowed to use the field, WUSA will have a very difficult time finding a suitable replacement on such short notice, especially near West U.  What harm can it do to postpone the work a couple of months?  West U is a city focused on families and community; what's more community-minded than allowing youth sports to use public park space??

Sincerely,

Susan Pereira
