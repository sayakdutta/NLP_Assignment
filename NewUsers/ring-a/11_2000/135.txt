Ok-I know you are probably mad at me because I have not contacted you since 
I've been here.  Believe me it is not because I haven't thought of you.  I 
thought for sure I'd run into you somewhere in the building but never have.  
Anyway I'm sending you a note to tell you to be on the look out for an 
invitation to a Nebraska Football party we are having on the 11th.  I am 
putting it in the interoffice mail this morning.  Hope you can make it.
