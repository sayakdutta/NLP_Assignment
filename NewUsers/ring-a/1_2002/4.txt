Hi!
     
        Sorry it took so long to respond but I took a couple of days off.  Tuesday is fine for dinner - looking forward to it.  It looks like UBS Warburg is our new owner.  We do not have any information yet from our management so I can't tell you any more about the structure of the company.  Hopefully I'll know more by Tuesday.  Let me know what time on Tuesday. Maybe we could eat somewhere closer to the loop since we only work until around 3:00 right now and you are out that way and Cindy has to go that way.
                       
 


Hey Andy,
 
I talked to Cindy and next week Tuesday sounds good  to her.  How about Ruggles again?  Let me know.
