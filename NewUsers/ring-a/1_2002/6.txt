Per our verbal discussion of Friday January 4, I requested 2000MMBtu/d of storage gas for the period January 5-7 to serve an existing market on Florida Pipeline. Ragan Bond at Bridgeline informed me that my request would be denied.  ENA needed to purchase pre-paid gas from Sequent to fulfill the market's request for additional supplies.  ENA did not attempt to schedule the delivery of gas out of storage after Bridgeline informed me they would not perform on our request because we would have needed to request the customer to submitt a nomination for a delivery that would not be confirmed.  Please let me know if you need additional information concerning this transaction.
