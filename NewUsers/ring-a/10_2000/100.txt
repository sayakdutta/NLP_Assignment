Hi!

              I know your probably mad at me but I took vacation on Friday 
and could not get my husband interested in coming downtown ( I know your 
thinking yeah right)!  Scott said it was fun!  Just because I didn't make 
your party does not mean you are out of sight  -  out of mind!  I wish you 
much happiness and a very bright future.  Take care and come to see us often 
(we are still waiting).
