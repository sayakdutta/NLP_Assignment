Hi!

         How are you?  I wanted to call you this week-end but I had such a 
bad one that I never had time.  First, I made a mistake at work that caused 
several people to have to work extra time on Saturday so I was on the phone 
with them all day ( I felt bad).   Sunday we went to brunch at Pappasitos and 
I left my retainer wrapped in a napkin on the table  -  so it cost me $800.00 
to replace - I was so mad at myself (you know how cheap I am).  I was off 
Monday & Tuesday and had four doctors appointments so that was fun.  I 
finally got my bookcases cleaned (there were spider webs all over them) and 
my Halloween decorations that Mom made me up.  My house looks really nice (to 
nice for us actually).  We finally got our chandelier for the dining room - 
it is so beautiful.  I made reservations for Thankgiving and was sad when Don 
told me this week-end that they are not planning on coming home because Lynn 
has to work.  I hope we can stay with you as I understand Carla & Russ are 
not doing well.  Maybe we can eat at the Rose - just  you & me.  Well better 
go.  Love you and take care of yourself.
