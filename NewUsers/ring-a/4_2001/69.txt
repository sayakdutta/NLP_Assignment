Mangled Manhood 
> 
> A man was in a terrible accident, and his "manhood" was mangled 
> and torn from his body. His doctor assured him that modern 
> medicine could give him back his manhood, but that his insurance 
> wouldn't cover the surgery, since it was considered cosmetic. 
> 
> The doctor said that the cost would be $3500 for small, $6500 for 
> medium, and $14,000 for large. The man was sure he wanted a 
> large, but the doctor urged him to talk it over with his wife 
> before he made any decision. The man called his wife on the phone 
> and explained their options. The doctor came back into the room, 
> and found the man looking quite dejected. 
> 
> "Well, what have the two of you decided?" asked the doctor. 
> 
> The man answered, "She'd rather remodel the kitchen."
