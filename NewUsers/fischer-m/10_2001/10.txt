Leesa,

I just found out that I had volunteered to buy a table for the SPA luncheon on Thursday, October 11th so I am trying to fill it up with people.  Would you be interested in attending a luncheon at the Houston Country Club on October 11th?  Susan Murray will be there.  Pamela and Jaye will not be able to attend because they are going to be out of town.

Let me know.

Mary
