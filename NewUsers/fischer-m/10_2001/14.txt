Becky,

I just found out that I bought a table for the Society for the Performing Arts luncheon on October 11th at the Houston Country Club and I am desparately trying to fill it.  I was wondering if you would be interested in going as my guest?  Susan will be there as well as Lessa White.  Let me know if you are interested?

Mary
