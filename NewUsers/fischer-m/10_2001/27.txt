Per my conversation with Eloise Williams the proceeds of $138,475,829 were never recorded on 33R but were recorded on 33Q.  Since this is a sale of inventory I'm assuming that the gain will be ordinary and should be reduced by the tax basis in the credits of $104.8 million.

Mary, I'm not sure what accounting is doing.  The entry below is not complete.  For third quarter close company 33R received proceeds of $138,475,829 for SO2 credits.  The credits are held in inventory on company 33Q, the mark-to-market revenue for the SO2 is reported on 33R.

The attached workbook is my best guess of the tax basis in the credits ($104.8 million); the tax gain should be about $33.7 million.

Can you check with your accounting contacts for company 33R to get a complete picture of the accounting entries?

The correct entry is a debit to 19999995 (Cash) and a credit to 45000000 (Revenue)
