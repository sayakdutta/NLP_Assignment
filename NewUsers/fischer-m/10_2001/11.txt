If I can fit into it, I plan to wear one of my really nice suits.  This is the ladies who lunch crowd so you will see everything.  I'm so glad that you can go.

 

 Thanks, Mary.  I would love to go.  I have it on my calendar.  Let me know the appropriate dress.

Leesa,

I just found out that I had volunteered to buy a table for the SPA luncheon on Thursday, October 11th so I am trying to fill it up with people.  Would you be interested in attending a luncheon at the Houston Country Club on October 11th?  Susan Murray will be there.  Pamela and Jaye will not be able to attend because they are going to be out of town.

Let me know.

Mary
