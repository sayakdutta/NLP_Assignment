How was the 15th?  Was it crazy?  Did any last minute clients come in begging to have their returns filed?  

Enron is still operating eventhough the President quit and they had to bring back Ken Lay.  Ken gave a speech this morning telling employees yes the stock has gone down but he predicts that it will go back up.  I hope that it does.

I'm planning to be at Debbie's party.  It sounds like it will be alot of fun.






Hey I hear you might be going to DG's Halloween party!!!  I will be there
and I think Doug will be there too!   Long time no talk!  Hope all is well,
we really need to have dinner sometime in the near future!

How are things going at Enron?

xox,

Vera

p.s.  I still have your pressure washer.....I will bring it to the party or
just let you know when I drop it off at your house.
