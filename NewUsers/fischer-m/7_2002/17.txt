currents all 3 phase if possible ( generator)
voltages all 3 phases if possible (generator
generator RPM, KW, generator temperature  1&2
generator rotor current ,voltage , frequency, any information the system is 
recording for the rotor I would like to get it.

Can we collect the above information over all the speed range of the 
generator since the turbine starts till maximum speed  (
