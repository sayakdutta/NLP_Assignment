Hi Bob,


Here are some notional sales prices at the Chicago City gate starting with calendar year 2003.  Of course, these prices are probably already old, as the NYMEX went up a little this afternoon, but nevertheless, they should at least give you some idea.

I'll gladly update these prices for you whenever you give me the word (we can update them fairly quickly).

Year 2003			$.3.355

Year 2004			$3.45

Year 2005			$3.54

Year 2006			$3.62

Year 2007			$3.71

Year 2008			$3.81

As far as a publication such as PIRA, that Enron would recommend, we really aren't comfortable making recommendations as such.

Regarding our electronic trading platform EnronOnline, I would like to spend a few minutes via the telephone, walking you through the steps to access that program (forms to be electronically completed).    I think you will enjoy having access to this tool, so let's set up a time.

P.S. Would you be trading under the entity, Corn Products, International, or another entity?  If it is Corn Products International, then we can proceed rather quickly.  I'd also like you to start looking at our ISDA agreements (International Swap Dealers Association), so that when you are in a position to trade financially, we have all the contracts in place.

Please reply when you have a moment.

Thanks
