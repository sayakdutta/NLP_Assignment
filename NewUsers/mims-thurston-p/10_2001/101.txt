Fannette in real estate........"shut yo mouth"....Angie and I are going to the Dance Theatre of Harlem tonight at jones hall and then we are going out.  Is jones hall fancy, should i look real good, or just good?

 

You are soooooooooooooo late.....(Smile)  Yes, I've seen Jewel, i tried to show her to you once before we were headed to the garage.  Yes, the looks great.  I asked her what was her secret and she said medical, plus a lot of prayer.  I just wanted to know what she took to lose it.  (Smile)

I heard that Cynthia lost a lot too.

And Fannette has been gone almost a year now.  (Smile)

She's also into Real Estate.



Girl,

Is Fanette Perry still here?  and no. 2, have you seen Jewel Meeks, she's lost a ton of weight and looks like her old self again.



 

YOU ARE WELCOME MY FRIEND............I'M GLAD TO KNOW YOU'RE STILL CHECKING YOUR E:MAILS.

  (SMILE)
