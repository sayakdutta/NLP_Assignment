Girl, what is PMO?  I'm doing fine, I just sent Tarsha an e-mail, and I hit the send button and there you are!  Is everything going as planned in all of your wedding preparations?  I certainly hope so.  I know planning a wedding is alot of work.  Jordan is still excited about walking with Taylor.

I had a good time with my boys this weekend.  They are crazy.  We went to the dreaded "Chuckee Cheese" this weekend and oh boy, was I ever glad to get out of there.  After that, we went  to the Galleria, because when I was there before without them, I saw a shoe store that had really cute, fashionable shoes for little boys.  What I didn't realize was that they were designer shoes.  Who ever heard of Kenneth Cole shoes for little boys.  $65 a pair for the kind that I liked.  But since I was there, I said, what the heck?  After about 20 minutes, we had been waited on, but still neither one of my boys had even tried on a pair of shoes yet, let alone buying a pair (the sales folks were truly taking their sweet time).  I was pissed and me and my possee (Jordan and Kendall) almost "set if off" at the Galleria.  We just left after I told them that their service was unacceptable.  Anyway, don't mess with Moma Thurston.

How was your weekend?

See ya!

 


Hi Patrice:

How are you today? I am wondering if you know who is over the PMO
department over there at Enron. My cousin in Austin received a phone from
them regarding employment and is curious about it.

Regards,
Hope
