would it be possible to leave it on ENA paper, it seems that would be the easiest

Patrice/Geoff, How do you guys want to handle the contract with this customer?  Will he stay on ENA paper or do we, EES, send him a new contract?  I need these answers today because the customer will be moved an EES pool today for June 1.

I would also like to see the contract you guys have with them so I can understand what obligations I would owe them.

Thanks,
Jesus
