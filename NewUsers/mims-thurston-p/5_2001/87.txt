Hi Liz,

Thanks in advance for putting me on the list of people to receive updates or notices regarding Alliance and/or Vector pipeline.  This information is extremely important as we are trading this product on EnronOnline without much information.  Also could you please add Lisa Kinsey and Mark Schrab to the e-mail list as they schedule all of the Alliance and Vector gas.  One last request, could you please send us the daily e-mails that specify the daily AOS allocations.

Thanks again.
