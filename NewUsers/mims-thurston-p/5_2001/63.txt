Darla, I spoke with Michelle at Nicor and I believe that everything is correct.  I corrected the tickets back on April 12, 2001.  Please let me know if this issue is settled or if we need to do more.  Thanks


 

My contact at Nicor, Mary Hill, says their trader confirmed with you that the price on deal #664380 should be GDD.  Sitara has GDP.  The price that was agreed to between you and the Nicor trader, according to Nicor, was $5.33 on the 10-12, according to our records, we are billing $5.34.  I need your help in correcting this matter.

Thanks
Darla Saucier
