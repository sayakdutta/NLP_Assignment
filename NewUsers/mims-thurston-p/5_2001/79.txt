We received a subscription request for MailBear Special Deal

you immediately afterwards, but have not received a reply to that message.

this message and we'll activate your account immediately!

If you did not submit a subscription request several days ago, it is
possible that someone is trying to subscribe you without your permission.
In that case, you do not need to reply, and this will be the last note
you'll get from us.

Thanks for your participation and we hope to serve you soon!

Just reply to validate your subscription request!
