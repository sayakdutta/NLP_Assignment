That's fine, but I think I got off kinda cheap, so let me know if I need to contribute more!  It was so much fun!

 


Cost

Patrice        $70.00
KC        $0
Marsha         318.00

Total          $318.00

Collected $136.00

Balance   $182.00

Divided by 3   $84.00 each


*I was supposed to pay for the meat at Sams, but since I wasn't a member I
couldn't pay so Marsha paid for the meat.
I gave Marsha the $136.00 I collected plus my $84.00 plus $14.00 (your part
of the  $84.00 Patrice) .  You don't have to pay anything, the $70.00 you
paid for food is your cost.  I know we all ended up probably paying a
little more than we anticipated once you add it all up, but after it all
was said and done, I think EVERYONE had a great time!!
