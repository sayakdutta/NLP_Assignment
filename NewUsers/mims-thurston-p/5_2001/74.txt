Dan Hyvl went back to the original trader and wants to double-check, but it seems pretty likely that everything needs to be done under Crestar.  Hold tight!

 

Patrice - Any word on this?




Hi Scott,

I'm still tracking down the Crestar issue, but at this time, it appears as though we should not have changed the name to Gulf Canada until recently when the sharing mechanism came into play with BP for the AOS.  Crestar confirmed this and Dan Hyval left me a voice mail alluding to thus, but I need to hear back from him to ask that direct question.  I'll be back in touch, hopefully this afternoon.

Thanks
