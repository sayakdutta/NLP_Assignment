Hi Dave,


I have attached a revised schedule per our conversation this a.m.  My options guy has done more research (at my insistence) to determine why our offers for the  5 days are of our sync....so giving me feedback does help me to get the "boys in line".  He has lowered his price by $0.31 so far.  I'll keep pushing!  

Please let me know how the 10 day option for Dec-Feb at the gate sounds.


Thanks


Patrice
