That's so exciting, did they kick Dorian to the curb!  I like the professionalism that the choir with achieve under Mike.  I'm excited!  How do you feel about it,  how did Robin feel?  I know we'll be jamming!.  I just hope we don't have to sing too many V. Michael McKay originals alllllllllll the time!

 

I called you last night with Robin, to tell you the stunning news.
Effective next week, V. Michael McKay will be over us.  He is going to take
us to the next level!  Can you believe this?  What are your thoughts?
