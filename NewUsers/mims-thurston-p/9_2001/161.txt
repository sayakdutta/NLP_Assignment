Good morning Rob,

Thanks so much, it's been a pleasure working with you.

Once the document is executed, will you please have someone fax me a copy at 713-646-3390 (also have someone call me to let me know its on its way).

Thanks again.

 


Patrice
I will be having this signed and sent to you tomorrow morning.  As we have
gone back and forth a few times, please let me know if you see anything
that does not reflect our final determinations.  I have included both the
redline and the final versions.
Thanks
