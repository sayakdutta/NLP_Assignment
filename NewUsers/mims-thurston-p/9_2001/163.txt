I was re-reading my previous e-mail back to you, and saw my typo!  (you know that's one of my pet peeves)---Well anyway, I'm pleased, I know he's not perfect, and I'm sure he will get on "our nerves" from time to time, but if we grow and learn something from him, and he helps us to reach our full potential as a choir, and we're actually proud of ourselves again, it'll work!!!!  Let's try to convince Robin to think in a positive light!  We've got much greater concerns right now!

Love ya!

P.S. I have a much needed hair appointment tonight, so I won't be home until real late, but I'll have my cell phone available.










 


Well, Robin isn't pleased at all.  She thinks that he's extremely rude and
arrogant.  I have mixed emotions.  I enjoyed most of his songs, but I won't
like his style all the time.  There has to be a mix.

Get our of here!!!!

That's so exciting, did they kick Dorian to the curb!  I like the
professionalism that the choir with achieve under Mike.  I'm excited!  How
do you feel about it,  how did Robin feel?  I know we'll be jamming!.  I
just hope we don't have to sing too many V. Michael McKay originals
alllllllllll the time!

    
   



         
   I called you last night with Robin, to tell you the stunning news.
   Effective next week, V. Michael McKay will be over us.  He is going to
   take
   us to the next level!  Can you believe this?  What are your thoughts?
