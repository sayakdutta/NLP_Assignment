Hi John,

Once again, so sorry about Enron's inability to transact on the deal this morning because of contract issues.

We need to fix the issue, so that it does not occur again, so.....attached is a copy of the agreement that we need you to review and execute.  I believe Sylvia may have worked on this back in March, and I wasn't sure if you all ever received a copy, but if you didn't here it is.

Please call if you have further questions.

Thanks
