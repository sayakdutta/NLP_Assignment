Girl, you cracked me up talking about the "holler" .  Now you know I don't 
know.  It was raggedy because we did not sing it with the lead.  He probably 
won't spring it on you Sunday, because we did not do that good without you 
there.

I am so tired from last night.  Everything is so rushed, and I did not get 
the kids in bed until 10:35 and then I had to get them up at 6:00 a.m.  I'm 
tired, so I know they are.  On top of all of that, the market is up another 
$1.00 today (yeah!!), but we have to stay late tonight  to go over our 
positions as a group.  My boss said that we will all stay until it's done, so 
make arrangements.  Naturally, Todd is working the evening shift, so I'm 
trying to work something out with my girlfriend and her daughter.  They just 
live right down the street.  So we'll see!  Talk with you later!
