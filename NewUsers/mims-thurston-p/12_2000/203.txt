How are you doing today?  Boy, isn't it cold!!!!!!  I don't think I will be 
at choir rehearsal tonight because of work.  Isn't the Christmas program 
Sunday?  I can't believe we are so ill-prepared.  We've only had two 
non-dedicated practices for the program.

We are required to spend the night downtown tonight (I'll be at the Double 
Tree Allen Center) because of the impending icy streets and the fear of not 
being able to get in tomorrow morning.  It's supposed to rain or lightly mist 
tonight between 11:00 p.m. and 8:00 a.m.   The streets are supposed to be 
treacherous if this thing materializes, so be very careful, in fact, you 
might want to talk with your supervisor  to come up with a contingency plan 
for the weather.

Anyway, that's all for now, talk with you later!
