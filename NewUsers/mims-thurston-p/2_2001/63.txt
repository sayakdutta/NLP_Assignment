Hi Daddy,


 I was thinking about you earlier this morning.  Glad to hear that you are 
not in any pain right now.  We just need to keep pressing to find the right 
combination of medicine.  My experience has been to be very persistent with 
the doctors and don't let up on them for re-evaluation.  I've learned alot 
with the boys, especially when they were very young and could not 
communicate.  I was kust extremely persistent, because there is no need for 
pain and  discomfort when, most  times, there is so combination of medicines 
that will get the job done.  

I was telling Momma I was cracking up when you were talking about your 
"breakthrough" on the radio.  I told her, if only the audience knew what you 
were talking about!

I still haven't had a chance to check into those houses in Virginina Beach 
for our vacation, I called yesterday afternoon around 4:30 and they were 
closed,I forgot about the time difference.  I 'm probably hesitating because 
I know everyone wants to go to Washington, and I;'m not quite sure that this 
is the right place.  What are your thoughts?

Well anyway, good luck on the "butt procedure", boy you and your butt".  Hope 
it's not too painful.

Keep taking the medicine and I'll talk with you this evening.

Is this your home e-mail or your office?
