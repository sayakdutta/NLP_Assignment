Thanks Ed,  I was visiting with Nicor and they talked about some deal on the electric side and they acted as though I knew about it....so I thought I would just inquire.  I'll give her a call.

Thanks

 


Terri Clynes is working with compression services (Jean Mrha's group) to convert compressors at one of Nicor's storage fields to  be electric driven. Terri can provide more info. on current status. Hope this helps.
