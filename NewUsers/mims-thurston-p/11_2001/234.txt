Thank you for the information.

Talk with you soon!

 

You may already know this, but I heard from guys at Nipsco that they did their first nom on Vector yesterday.  Also, Border interconnect expected Dec. 15th.  The heater hit a bridge so they are trying to do some field repairs. Not much else to report.
