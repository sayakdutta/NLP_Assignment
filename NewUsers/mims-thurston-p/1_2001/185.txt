Hey,

I was just getting ready to send you an e-mail and I opened my mail and there 
you were.  Things are going okay, the market is down 14 cents so we'll see 
where it ends up.  

Yes, good news, my dad got out of the hospital yesterday and they called just 
as I was leaving for rehearsal and he's doing pretty well.  He still is 
extremely tired and has not regained his strength, but Praise God, at least 
he's out of the hospital and in good spirits.  I suspect that there is alot 
that goes on that they don't tell me, so I really don't know everything.  But 
I made them promise to give me things, as they happen.  I'm going down there 
next month.  We get President's Day off and I'll be on my way.  Todd wants to 
drive, but I don't see the point, when the weather may turn on you in a 
heartbeat, and especially with Kendall.  He's drive us crazy!

Anyway, we have a three day weekend this week, with Dr.King's birthday, are 
you off?  

I spoke with Robin last night and she was mainly complaining about her job, 
but she's hanging in there.

See you later!
