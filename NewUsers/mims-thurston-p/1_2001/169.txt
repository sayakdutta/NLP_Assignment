I have two counterparties that we have invoiced for gas on December 13th - 
Coral and CMS.  In both cases I am being told that this gas is also  being 
invoiced by Petro-Canada and that it was baseload and at a cheaper price than 
what we are invoicing them for.




Both counterparties have stated that they will not pay our invoiced amount.  
Is it possible that these deals should be invoiced to Petro-Canada instead of 
CMS and Coral?  Would you let me know what the resolution is?

Thanks  for your assistance
