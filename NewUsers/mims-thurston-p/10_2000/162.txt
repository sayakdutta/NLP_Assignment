How are you?  Hope everything is going well.  Did you receive my response to 
your last e-mail?  I wasn't sure if it transmitted or not.  Nothing new going 
on here.  I have a week of vacation scheduled for the week of October 16th.  
I really haven't made any plans, but maybe we'll go visit my family in 
Omaha.  It's really hard for me to plan, b/c I may have to work some of the 
week.  I'm not sure yet, so I hate to plan a vacation that may have to be 
interrupted.

Church services were  really good this past sunday, Pastor preached a good 
sermon.  

Talk with you later
