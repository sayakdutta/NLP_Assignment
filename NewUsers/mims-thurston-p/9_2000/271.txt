Good afternoon Rev. Jackson.

So nice to hear from you, I'm glad we';ve got this e-mail business figured 
out.  Hope your day is going well.  Sometime, please tell me what "A Day in 
the Life of Rev. Jackson" is like at SWCBC.  Do you see alot of people all 
day long (during the day)?  So often, it's hard to picture the church as 
being active all day long.  It just seems like people attend meetings and 
services about twice a week in the evenings.  Funny, how we get perceptions 
in our heads.

My day is going pretty good so far, I'm back to making money in my "book" 
here at work and it sure feels good.  I've always remembered what you told me 
during my "crisis period" and always keep those things in mind.  The one that 
I like the best is "Just keep your mind stayed on him, He'll keep you in 
perfect peace".  I take that with me everywhere I go.


Well, anyway, thanks for the words of encouragement.

Appreciate it!
