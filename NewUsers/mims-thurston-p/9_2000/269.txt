Judy,

I thought I was through, but I'm not.....Can you please send up the the 
following contracts:

Wisconsin Power & Light  96045691

WPS     96001003

Also, if someone in my group has already checked it out and returned to you, 
just tell me who had it and I'll copy off of them (smile!!).

Also, do you have a copy of the GTC.  We have no idea what it is, and we're 
looking for the non-performance language associated with it.

Thanks!
