I talked to Moma last night and she said that Daddy's cancer cells were all gone as far as the prostate cancer is concerned, as a result of the radiation.  She cautioned me not to get too excited because the Dr. said the cancer will reappear, but they don't know where.  She said Daddy has not been in any pain for a couple of weeks now.  It seems that the problem right now is the vomiting and nausea.  She said they had a Dr's appt. today to see about it.  She said Daddy is soooo skinney.

Daddy has not responded to my e-mail, so I think I am right,, because normally if you are alright financially, you quickly tell people, but in this case, I have not heard back from him.  Strange!  Anyway, if this is true, I might have to put my part-time employment ideas on hold for a little while longer, because I will not have them going without, and I will not have Momma going back to a regular full time job under any circumstances.  I was kind of thinking that anyway, with the stock market taking a nosedive the way it did with my retirement money.  Anyway, talk with you later.

P.S. I forgot to tell you that I am working out three times a week for an hour each time.  Our boss is letting us leave at 4:00 p.m. to go to the company gym to work out.  It's about 6 or 7 of us doing it.  It's much more fun working out with a group as opposed to by yourself.  Maybe I'll see some results one day.

Talk with you later.
