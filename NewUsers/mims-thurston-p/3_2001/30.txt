Hey Girl, 

Sorry about last night, remember I told you I was looking for my NyQuil, well 
I found it and took a couple of swigs and went straight to sleep.  I really 
meant to call you back, but could not wake up.  I finally woke up around 
11:30 and got up and got a drink of water.  

By the way, the latest, unconfirmed rumor, is that Samatha and Anessa Hall 
Joseph are supposed to be pregnant!  

See you!
