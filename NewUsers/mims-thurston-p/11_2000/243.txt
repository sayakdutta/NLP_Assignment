Hey girl,

I know you've been busy and I can certainly understand that!  It's been up 
and down over here, but I'm hanging!  Hope everything is going well with 
you.  Did the kids enjoy Halloween?  My kids sure did.  I did not realize 
that we did not have rehearsal last Tuesday because of Halloween.  I wasn't 
going anyway!  

Don't forget I leave for Phoenix tonight for my cousin's wedding, so I'll be 
back on Sunday afternoon.

Talk with you later.
