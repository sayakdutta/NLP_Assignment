So, I'm glad we see "eye-to-eye" on that one regarding Razoo's !  Robin and 
Anna have the strangest way of doing things.  I asked Robin at least two 
weeks ago, and she said she had to get with Anna, and now she's telling you 
that they're ready and haven't said anything in the way of confirmation to 
me.  Let me see if I can get ahold of her and then we'll talk again, because 
at this point, I'll need a sitter b/c Todd has the work Friday night, and 
he'll be tired on Saturday (although that's no problem).  But, like last 
time, I don't want to go if you can't go.  Let me try and call her and we'll 
talk later.  So are you free on Saturday?

Also, everything is going okay over here, the market is down severely this 
morning, so we'll see!
