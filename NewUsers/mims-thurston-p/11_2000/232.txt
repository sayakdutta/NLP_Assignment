So hello,

What happened at rehearsal last night?  I did not make it, partly because I 
was tired and I had several errands to take care of.  I needed to stop by 
K-Mart and the grocery store last night to get things I really needed, and 
just did not want to be out late.

Let me know!!!

Talk to you later.

P.S. is everthing else going okay?
