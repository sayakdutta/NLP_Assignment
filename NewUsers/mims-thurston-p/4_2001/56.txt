I just spoke with Sharon Mahon and she asked me to tell you hello.  Did you know that she was expecting a baby girl in August?  She's five months pregnant and getting married on this Sunday to 
Tyrone.  Can you believe it?  She seem's happy.

Did Barbara ever talk with my friend about singing at the wedding?  What did she decide?

Talk with you later!
