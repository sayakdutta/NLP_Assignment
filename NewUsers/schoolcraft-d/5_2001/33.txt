Right now it looks like we can run station 9, station 7, station 6 or station 5.  We will just have to see what we have scheduled for the day.  This
will allow us to set our HP accordingly.  Unless I'm missing something Station 8 should not be needed.  However I will check with OPS team 
to reverify volumes.

So,

We don't need Station 8 and we can still stay with the schedule to run the smart pigs when 8 is down in September?

You are correct looking at the models Ken  Chow ran before he left was between 175 to 225  this will allow the pig to move
approx. between 5 to 6 miles an hour.

Darrell,
At Gallup last year it took about 250 mmcfd to run the pig 6 miles per hour.  If my memory is bad someone let me know.  If we can move that amount with 7 & 9 easily then there should be no problem.
Thanks,  Arnie

Is there a reason we think we will need to run station 8.  I think with the volumes we will have to move to insure 6 miles and hour for the smart pig
will be approx. 100 to 200 m2.  If my thinking is wrong please let me know.

This is to advise that if we are now actively looking at rescheduling the smartpigging dates that was previously agreed upon at our Albuquerque mtg on April 11th, we need to know ASAP.  We do not have alot of flexibility in juggling schedules based on smartpig tool availability, but we can sure check and see what shakes out.

Plz let me know at the earliest possible date what the plans are here.

Thanks - Max

TW - Station 6-7 & Station 7-8 Smart Pigging - C.014524/C.014527
Project will conflict with Station 8 Automation Project if conducted in September or later.  Actively chasing TD Williams and PII for their cost estimates.  Must review costs to determine if dollars are sufficient.  Project should try to be a done in August or sooner if at all possible.
