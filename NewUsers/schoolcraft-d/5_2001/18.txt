What is the time frame these units need to be down.  There are no postings for volume deductions.  Please someone give me
some ideas.

Thanks Ds


   
	  		




Attached is a project schedule for the month of June indicating station outages and further defining project needs for Power Services personnel.  The letters like S1, S2,... indicate location of each person.  This is a tentative schedule and and personnel and purpose is subject to change depending on information gathered by Analysts.

Unit 401 outage scheduled on June 6th requires that unit to be down for some time.  Analysis performed last Thursday indicates there are unloaders that are definitely not operating or leaking significantly.  Presently, it is unknown what kind of problems will be uncovered on inspection of the unloaders.  Information on the malfunctioning unloaders will be distributed as soon as inspections are completed Wednesday.

 

Should there be any questions, please call me on my cell phone:  806-886-8105
Thanks
