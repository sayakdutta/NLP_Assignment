 

Notes:
1)  After testing is completed for the day, we are showing Both Units
Chilled but Unfired at a base condition of 463 MW.
DETM can schedule more or less than the 463 MW in Real Time, depending on
the market and gas control agreement.
2) OK to shut off one CT rather than operate both at reduced load.
