As discussed on the phone, Citizens personnel have been working with Trigon Engineering on-site to better tune the station.  We would like to continue refinements and desire our field measurement technician Tommy Tucker to observe via Rocklink whenever the primary selection is switched.  Therefore until instructed otherwise, please call Tommy as soon as it is known that a switch will occur, giving him as much lead time to log in and observe. Therefore, be prepared to tell him the exact time the 1 or 2 will be entered.
His cell number is (928) 715-7004. 
If Tommy cannot be reached, go ahead and make the switch with one exception. 
Exception:  If the inlet pressure to the Citizens Owned Station is less that 575 psig on either pipeline, do not change the primary selection without permission.  Permission shall be requested by calling one of the following Citizens Employees.  Please attempt to call the person listed first, and only call the person listed second if you cannot reach the first person.   1- Tommy Tucker (928) 715-7004 2- Dan Snodgrass (928) 310-5080  3- Martin Conboy (928) 380-5777 or 4- Robert Franson (928) 853-6322.
