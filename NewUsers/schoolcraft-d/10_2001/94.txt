I do thank you for everything you do for the Logistics team.  We will get you what you need in a more timely manner.
Today I was running at a fast pace with TW, NNG, systems.
Again thank you.

Darrell, you can win!!!  We did receive it when Michelle got back from the morning meeting, but I am responsible for getting it to him first thing when he get's in.   I make sure that he gets what he needs and if that means getting on you, I will do so.....(smile).  

I  heard that Jan Moore can access this map so I will make arrangments with her to get it to him as well, maybe as a backup.

We enjoyed you guys today and thanks for coming to our outing.....

I did not send one first thing this morning, however I did give the map to Michelle in the morning.  I told her I did not
fax one down this morning.  Sorry Steve didn't get his copy seems I can't win either way.  He will get one from someone.

Darrell, we did not receive the gas day map this morning via fax.

Would you please make the necessary arrangements to have this document faxed to Steve every morning.  It is essential that we receive this on a regular basis.

Thanks in advance for your assistance,
