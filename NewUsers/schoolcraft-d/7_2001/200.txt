Tracy,

	Per our conversation of Friday July 27, 2001, Conoco would like to
transfer the imbalance quantities and value from the Zia contract #26301 to
the Maljamar contract #21840.  Please make this netout effective July 31,
2001.  Any imbalance owed to Transwestern from the Malajmar OBA contract
#21840 after the netout will be paid back to TW starting August 1, 2001.

	If you have any questions, please call me.
