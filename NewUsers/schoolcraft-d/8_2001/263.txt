The measurement tech should be back this week and looking at that point.  They control the flow.
Will let you know asap. as I find something out.

Darrell,
 
You faxed some stuff to Tony Gomez on Aug. 22. I was wondering if you had heard anything yet. I think you said that TW had control of the measurement at that Interconnect. Please refresh my memory on this issue. I would like to continue pursuing this imbalance as soon as any new information is gained.
 
Thanks,
