This is for smart pig runs.  I have already let PNM know that Rio Puerco will not be able to flow to TW for the
18th -- 20th.  

Thanks DS

Good news for once.
I just spoke with Mike Blount with PII.  He indicated modification of their 1.5 D Tool is technically feasible and modifications can be completed in time to do both pig runs as originally scheduled (Sept. 18 and Sept 20).  He will let us know what this cost will be early next week.  (Maybe that's the bad news part.  I hope not).

Anyway, we're back on our original plan.
