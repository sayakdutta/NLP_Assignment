I had to wait to get back to you this morning, sorry I will not be able to be there.  I need to leave 
at 2:00 pm today to take my daughter to the dentist.

 

I sent a message out last week regarding this meeting for today that Jo Williams requested and have not received a response from you.  Please let me know if you are available or if I need to reschedule.

Meeting time:	3:00 - 4:00 pm
Place:		(VCR) 4102/696
