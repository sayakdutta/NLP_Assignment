I agree with lindy that non-physical points be excluded.

I think TW should exclude non-physical points.  This seems to be addressed in "What needs to be added" where it says "Listing all physical points valid for transport", but I'm sure it would clarify things to have that non-physical points should be excluded in the "What points to include" category.

After reviewing this list, should TW exclude non-physical points like NNG?

Lindy, this is the report that I was referencing in the notes from the meeting with Jeanne. I have copied Toby since he worked on this last year. Do you and Darrell and Perry agree?

Thanks Ramona
