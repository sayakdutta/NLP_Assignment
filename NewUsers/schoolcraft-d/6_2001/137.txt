 

The plan for the weekend is to cut the volume flowing down the A-line to around 30mmcf/day this should reduce the moisture at Bushton significantly.  We plan to resume the sweep after the holiday and hope to have it completed in a timely manner.  If their are any questions or comments please let us know. Personnel can be reached at either number through the weekend.

Thanks
