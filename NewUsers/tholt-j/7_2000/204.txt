Jane, any chance you or Randy or Tori could go to this meeting?  Norm has 
called it for this Friday, presumably to discuss some of the points you 
raised in your discussion with him (according to the voice mail he left me).  
It will be in El Paso, starting at 1:00 pm MT.

Unfortunately, I don't think I can make it, and I've left Norm a voice mail 
message to that effect.  However, I'm not too optimistic about it getting 
rescheduled for next week.  I'm losing 2-1/2 days going to Las Vegas for the 
settlement conference as it is, and I will have to get my Order 637 comments 
finalized by Friday afternoon in order to get them filed next Monday.  We 
have some big problems with segmentation proposals (or lack thereof) for 
Columbia and CNG, as well as some issues on several of the other pipelines 
that filed.
