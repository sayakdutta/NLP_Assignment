actually forced myself to read last night - trying to get smart

 

They have some cute guy lawyers this year-but I bet you probably watch that manly Monday night Football.


 

bits and pieces - never really got into Ally

i assume you did..

 

Did you watch Ally last night?


 

such a tough life

 

I saw the tv advertisement last night for Temptation Island for Thursday.  I think it may conflict with Will and Grace.  Could be a tough night.

 

it looks to be on Thursdays at 8

I was looking in the TV guide and did not see where it is on this week let me know if they changed the date and time.

 

um.....no....sorry - i guess he is why you are watching?

aren't there good looking boys on the island?

 

Have you seen Ben on Felicity?

 

i don't understand how you put Felicity on the same level at TI2...

 

I am a desperate person for entertainment-what can I say.

 

that is horrible - i am embarrassed for you...

 

it's on the sasme night as Felicity


 

that's no fun

 



 

I'm not sure I'm going to watch it.  None of the people really interest me
