thank you

 

Hey Janie, 
     I mailed the clubs today through the post office.  The delivery confirmation number is  0300 1290 0007 1615 9547  and the web site to track it on is www.usps.com  or call  1-800-222-1811.  I took all the stickers off the clubs so all you have to do is take the stickers off the box then wrap it. 
     Cost breakdown: 
            Austad's Golf         681.56 
            Post Office               16.75 
                   Total              698.31 
      P.S.     I'll send the receipts via mail
