Southwest Gas currently views Enron Online but is afraid to transact physical 
volumes on it because they are afraid the payment terms on Enron Online are 
different than non-EOL trades.  They stated that they reveiwed the EOL 
contract and that it does not address payment.  I told them that the payment 
terms do not differ but they are asking for something in writing.  Can you 
send them something.
