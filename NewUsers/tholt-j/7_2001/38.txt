yes I am going.  I will also need toknow if there are signigicant items going to be considered at the weekly FERC meeting and what items are being considered on consent agenda.  We want to know ahead of item which itmes are being ruled on .

 

We are going to create a link on your intranet site that will give you regular regulatory updates, but this will take us a few weeks.  But let me know whatever you need.  Are you going to the El Paso meeting next week in DC?
