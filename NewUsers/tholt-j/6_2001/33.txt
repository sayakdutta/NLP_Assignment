I talked with Markat SW Gas-just honro his numbers

Nancy, can you please reconfirm with Mark the price for the gas at Bondad?  My trader is supporting her price of SJ Bondad GDP rather than SJ Non-Bondad GDP.

Thanks

actually -for volumes flowing out of bondad-which is deal number 763736 price is bondad gda;for blanco-deal number 759933-price is nonbondad gda
 

Jane, on deal 763736 for May 01 sales to Southwest Gas, we have a pricing discrepancy.  Our system reflects SJ Bondad GDP but SWG is going to pay us based on SJ Non-Bondad GDP.  Can you please confirm which price is correct and make the change in Sitara if necessary?

Thanks

Sorry about the flooding.  Hope you and your family survived ok.  Attached are the gas settlement and support for May.  The only difference we had was for package V02.  Mark Anderson says that even though Bondad gas flowed, the price was Non-Bondad.

Have a great day.  Nancy
