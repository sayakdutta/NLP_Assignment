thank you for handling this


 

We're all set for Wednesday.  I have reserved a meeting room (EB4746) for Enron people, and the dial in number for outside participants is:

		(877) 233-7845
		Participant Code:  281132

We have 15 ports.  If you get any more people, let me know and I'll ask for an expansion.
