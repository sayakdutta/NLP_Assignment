As of 10:00 a.m. Joe is in Wichita

 

Hey Janie,

     Don't worry, I have everything figured out.  Everyone is coming
over in shifts.
Barney wanted the two to three in the morning shift.  I think he'll be
home early
after a few non stop days of drinking.  If I hurt him bad enough maybe
he'll stop
the habbit.  I tried calling him on his mobil but it says it is no
longer in service.  I used
281-826-5246.  If he has a new number, E-mail it back to me.
     I was just thinking, I better call your Dad to see what shift he
wants.
