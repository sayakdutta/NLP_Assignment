Sorry , I have not given you feedback earlier but I've been on vacation.  
Randy continues to do an excellent job.  He anticipates questions and usually 
has the answers.  He is a very dedicated employee and continues to expand on 
his knowledge base.  He has helped the traders trade the permian and waha 
points on a daily basis and such commercial experience has proven to be very 
valuable regarding looking for alternatives to move gas.  The only area for 
improvement that I might suggest would be to challenge others or state his 
opinion if he has a different opinion from others rather than not say 
anything or go along with the status quo.  He tends to want to be 
nonconfrontational which is not a bad thing but this is a tough environment 
and he could get run over if he does not state his opinion.
