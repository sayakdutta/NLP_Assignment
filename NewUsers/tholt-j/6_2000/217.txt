As promised during today's meeting, attached is a file containing some data
on the quantity of gas physically flowing out of each of the receipt basins
for the period 1998 through June 8, 2000.  The data was taken from the VISA
system (note the index numbers on the spreadsheet) and is presented
graphically and as tabular values.

The flow west on the southern system is shown as the sum of west flow
through Pecos River and Waha stations less the east flow from Cornudas.
This represents the net volume flowing west from Cornudas Station into the
combined low and high pressure southern systems.  It eliminates the volumes
moved east to Waha for delivery into the Texas intrastate pipelines at Waha.
