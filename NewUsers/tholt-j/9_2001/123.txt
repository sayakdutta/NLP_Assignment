Who are you talking to at Socal.  The deal was for July imbalance which was traded at the end of August.  Maybe they are confused.  Tell them to talk to Steve Baird.

The imbalance trade for July 2001 is deal #1020741 and is to Southern California Gas Company for 320,000 mmbtu.  So. Cal. is saying they are only aware of a trade for August for 320,000 which matched deal #1019969 that is on the spreadsheet.  Did these 2 deals get put in correctly?

Please let me know.

Thanks,
