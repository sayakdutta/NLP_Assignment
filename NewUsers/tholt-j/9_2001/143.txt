Call me for lunch-maybe we can go on Friday or on Monday


 

Janie;   Sure was great to see you yesterday............It was so ironic that you ask me about getting married, and I pick up an engagement ring the same day.  Did you say that you saw pictures of Deb's wedding?  Was it on some porno web site?  Just kidding!!!  She still can't speak to me without getting upset and it will be 4 years on Halloween.  Hope all is going well.......... somehow I think it is, by the smile I saw on your face.

                                                                                               Bob
