We can not pay any deposits

 

Good morning Janie, I hope things are going okay for you, I know this is a
trying time.  I needed to contact you and see if there is a remote chance
that Enron North America Corp. would try to transport gas under the NW New
Mexico Off-system Transportation Contract T30233???   I have some deposit
request letters in hand, but I was not going to sent them out until the dust
settled a little, unless this transaction for transportation is something
that you may do soon??  Please give me your best assessment of this
situation.  Thanks,
