	Hello Tamara,

	Brian Terp has been given access to EnPower, however,
	the GCP_Houston team will need to know which desk(s),
	specifically, that Brian needs access.

	Please supply the full desk(s) name(s), i.e. EPMI Long Term PJM.

	Best Rgds.

Please set up Brian Terp with an ID for the East Power Trading Desk...

Brian Terp

Northeast Region under Mark Dana Davis

Please use Paul Thomas or Joe Stepenovitch as an example.

Thanks for your help,
