Susan,
Please let me know if this gets approved? furthermore, I would like to see the Tariff to see if the changes will affect our business.

Thanks
Paul

On September 4, 2001, the New York Independent System Operator, Inc. (NYISO) filed revisions to amend Attachment F of the NYISO Market Administration and Control Area Services Tariff to extend the duration of its currently effective $1,000/MWh Bid Caps on certain NYISO-administered markets; and amend Attachment Q to the NYISO's Open Access Transmission Tariff and Attachment E of the ISO Services Tariff to extend its Temporary Extraordinary Procedures for Correcting Market Design Flaws and Addressing Transitional Abnormalities.  

If you need further information please let me know.
