Thanks you for help? Do you know where I might be able to get a quote on the Flair Collection??

Hi Paul,
I'm so sorry, I thought your phone number was on this message but now that I
looked at it further it's not on here.

I was just notified by management that we don't have the Flair collection.
We have regular Bernhardt but not this one.

My apology for the inconvenience this might cause.

I would like to get a quote on the following sofa
It is a Bernhardt brand and the style is CATALINA - two love seats and a
wedge (sectional sofa) and I would like 4 pillows
the fabric is FLAIR - on the sofa the fabric code is 7063-010 ( I
believe this fabric is an I grade)
                 - on two of pillows the fabric code is 7143-032
-	on two of pillows the fabric code is 7132-002

I live in Houston Texas.. you can include ballpark shipping costs
Thank you for your help
