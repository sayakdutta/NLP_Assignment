Hey homes,

Not going to be here this weekend after all.. I am taking a last minute getaway to yes RIO for the weekend and few days next week.  It's tough but someone has to do it!! 

We can hook up next time.. 

PS I will drink a few Caparinhas for ya!  Haha

Well then mark your calendar because it looks like I'm gonna be hitting
H-town full force the weekend after Labor Day (too much lake time to pass
up in Austin Labor Day weekend).

Don't be scared...
