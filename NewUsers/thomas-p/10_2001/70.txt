2.  The procedure and rules on how Generators bid in their capacity.
3.  Fundamental Impact on NYCA due to the Sep 11 catastrophe.
4.  Overview of the proposed NorthEast RTO and NYISO's feeling about where the whole process is headed.
5.  Impacts on NY with Ontario's restructuring and impacts with HQ transfers to NY.
6.  How Transmission Charges are calculated when transacting with neighboring regions.
