Paul,

I spoke with David Lawrence.  He did indicate that there would be slide presentations available prior to the meeting with which conference-call participants could use to keep up but acknowledged that attendance would probably be more effective.  I'd suggest talking with Dana about the prospect of attending.

Tom--let me know what you'd prefer & if Dana wants Paul to attend we can make arrangements together (as long as I don't have to share a room with Paul).

Jeff

 

Folks,

We should have a couple of people take part in this training.  Dana/Paul, do you have anyone taking part?  

Jeff, would you talk to the contact person listed below and find out if you think it is worth sending someone or if we can get enough benefit by participating via teleconference?

Thanks,

Tom.
