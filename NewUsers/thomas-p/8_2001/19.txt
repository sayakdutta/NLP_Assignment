Philroy,

I have not been pumping lately, actually it has been at least 8 months since I have been into Bally's.  However, I am riding my mountainbike around town and through some trails so if you are up that then let me know?

Homes, what are you up to.. how was the trip to Australia??

Later

Yo PT,

I tried leaving you a message on your cell phone, but
I think it was your wifes phone.  Anyways, I am in
Houston and have been working out at Bally's.  I was
wondering if you still belong and want to hit some
work outs.  Let me know.

Later

Phil
