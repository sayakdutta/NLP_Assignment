Hi Tammy!  Thanks for asking about me!
I'm doing fine.  I have been very fortunate over the last year with this whole mess.
It just hurts to know so much pain has been created needlessly. 
I thought that things were supposed to make more sense as you grow older?

How about you and Mike?  
I hope all is well!  If there is anything I can do please let me know?
	
	Jim

 


`	Jim, hope all is ok with you.  I have been keeping touch with Joan and this whole situation is unbelievable.  I guess I am still in shock about it all.  

		Let me know how you are doing.

				Tammy
