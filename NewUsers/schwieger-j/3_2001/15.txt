Jim, I know I asked you a similar or maybe even the samequestion a few weeks ago but I really believe that the question was limited to ERCOT and we therefore determined that other than Bammel , Enron had no storage in ERCOT......I do recall that you mentioned 2 places where we had capacity...but that were not in ERCOT...I do believe they are in TEXAS and the question now is Enron's storage capacity in all of TEXAS.  

I need this information Urgently.................PLEASE HELP!!!!!!

MANY Thanks
