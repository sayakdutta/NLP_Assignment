The only one's that come to mind related to Storage is Market Hub Partners and Western Gas Storage.   Market Hub Partners sold Moss Bluff to Duke and Western Gas Stg sold Katy storage to Aquila.  As far as address, type of entity and phone numbers I have no idea.

Please provide me with the name, address,type of entity, and phone number of each entity that you know of who entered or exited from the Texas natural gas intrastate pipeline market or natural gas storage facility  from 1999 to present.Also please forward this memo to any HPL or Enron employee who would know this information without having to do research the issue outside of Enron.

Thanks
