KENNY:
IM OK WITH THE ADDITIONAL VACATION DAYS,  BUT DID YOU KNOW THAT AEP IS GOING TO BE DOWN HERE DURING THE PERIOD MAY 18-31, DOING BID WEEK.  SHOULD YOU CHECK WITH SOMEONE THERE?  DO YOU WANT TO BE GONE WITH THEM HERE?  JUST LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU DECIDE.

	THANKS, JIM

 

Can I add two more vaction days?  Since I am driving to Penscola, I would like visit a very sick friend in New Orleans.  If I can, I would like to take May24th & May 30th also.  I will make sure the bammel positon report and the AGA activities are covered.  May close should not be a problem since we are adding since we are updating assumptions as we inject.  I can make the final true-ups for May on the 31st.  Let me know if these extra vacation days will cause a problem for you.
Thanks,
Kenny
