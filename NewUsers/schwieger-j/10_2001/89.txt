How are you today?
Things are OK down here!
Nothing really new since last night!

NYMEX went against me big time this morning so I decided to get flat.
That will mean a $1,000,000 loss today but I will still be positive for the month!
Its the little things that count, right!

They continue to hate ENE!
It really makes me wonder?

Be Safe!
