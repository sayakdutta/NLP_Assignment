OK with me. Please put on my calendar if its for sure!

 

Jim, Brian Redmond would like for you to interview a gentleman named Bill Ward this Thursday (10/4).  Would you be willing to meet with Mr. Ward at 3:00?  Tom's on vacation that day, just in case you weren't aware.

Please let me know ...
Thanks,
Laura
