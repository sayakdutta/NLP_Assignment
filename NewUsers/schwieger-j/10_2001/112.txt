Yea! Yea! Yea! Yea!

 

Well, it looks like I'm going to have to reschedule this interview another day because Brian would like for Tom to meet the candidate as well.

I'll keep ya posted!

OK with me. Please put on my calendar if its for sure!

 

Jim, Brian Redmond would like for you to interview a gentleman named Bill Ward this Thursday (10/4).  Would you be willing to meet with Mr. Ward at 3:00?  Tom's on vacation that day, just in case you weren't aware.

Please let me know ...
Thanks,
Laura
