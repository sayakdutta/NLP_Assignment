Yo!
Yes, I believe your typical campells will have little mushroom pieces in it.  And kmart would be a good place to buy a pyrex dish (glass baking)....of course you could borrow any supplies from me any time.  Are you cooking up some grub for a lil lady???
I heard you all had a great time.  Saw the pic of you that john said you "woke up" for at the brewery.  Maybe we all can get together for a brew before john and i are off for alaska on sunday.  we will be gone for a week and a half.  Maybe friday after work.
Let me know if you have any other cooking q's.

Hey Momar.  Did you have a peaceful  week?  We had a blast.  I've got a couple of Q's for ya.  Does  cream of mushroom soup have actual mushroom pieces in it?  And where would  be a good place to buy a glass baking/casserole dish?
 
Thanks,
Robbie
