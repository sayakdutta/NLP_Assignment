Thanks.  Give me a ring when you have a chance.  I baked both the cakes last night.  Love to tell you about it.
By the way...that is the best damn chocolate cake i have ever had...that was exactly what i was looking for.
Talk to you later.

2-12" cakes may work ok but you might swap the positions about half way
through the cooking time.I'm pretty sure it will take longer than the
prescribed time but it will work. To acurately test them,touch the top of
each layer.If the finger marks bounce back you're there.If they remain
indented.bake a little longer.Perhaps 2 minutes at a time.If you have any
pressing issues call my cell(713-725-2676) Good luck    Den
