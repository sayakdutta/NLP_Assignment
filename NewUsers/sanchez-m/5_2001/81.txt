Melba,

Mike is interested in putting out some of our west eol products on a 24 basis, similar to the nymex desk.  However, we would like more information on how this would work and  what kinds of controls are available for products to shut off automatically.  If you have time today, perhaps you could swing by our desk and give us more information.  Sometime in the afternoon would be great for us.
Let me know.
Thanks,
Monique
