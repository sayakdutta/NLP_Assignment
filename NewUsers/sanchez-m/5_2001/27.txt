well,
for those of you that thought i was sticking around portland....uh, psyche!
just kidding...uh, whoops!
 
actually, portland was great.  i plan on returning there post-summer to give it another go...hopefully with more money in the account for those financial droughts.  unless of course a climbing trip to thailand happens to come up!!!!!
 
as for now...stop sending all those letters to portland and just change the address to minnesota.  as always, cookies and chocolate are always welcome.

here i shall reside with the bugs and anything else that'll try to crawl into my sleeping bag.  i will be here from the 11th of may until the end of august.  email is still prob'ly the best way to get a hold of me.  by the time i get there, i'll have a new cell # so you can leave voice mails anytime, otherwise you can usually leave messages on the office phone.
 
in case that itch to travel gets to you this summer and you find yourself  in the northwoods with no where to rest your weary head.....always know that you can stop on by at a moments notice!
 
so until the next time, be well, smile plenty, and hug someone you  love.
 
off belay,
