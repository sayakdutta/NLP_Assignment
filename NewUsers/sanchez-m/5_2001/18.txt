Made the ganache last night...tastes great...do you glaze it on the cake or frost the cake?  It said frosting..but to me it looked glazeable.
Ran to make a cake during lunch to pick up last few things.  What do you think about baking 2 12x2 cakes in one oven at the same time...staggering the pans?  I was wondering if it wouldn't bring down the oven temp because it might interfere with the air circulation in the oven.  Oh well...not sure what I'm going to do.  My plan is to bake the cakes tonight.  Everything is already measured.  I am crossing my fingers that my oven doesn't wig out.....last night it did when i was making financiers.......my oven is very temperamental...though it has been good lately.  Talk to you soon.

Question:
For the engine cake do you use the recipe for the ganache on there or a
different one?
I was planning on trying their recipe.
Tonight i'm going to measure out everything.  I'll keep you updated.
