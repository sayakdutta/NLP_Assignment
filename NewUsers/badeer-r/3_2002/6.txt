Monaco,
	Whats up with you? Great SuperBowl. I hate the Rams, so glad they lost. I'm going down to Houston to work for UBS on the gas trading desk. New commodity for me, should be fun. Looking to get back to NY at some point in the future. I know you'll still be there, stinking up the joint. Anyway, will let you know how things go. Talk to you soon.
