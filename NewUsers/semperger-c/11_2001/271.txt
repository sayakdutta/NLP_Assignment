Susie and I talked, she and I agreed that she would work 7-1 m-th,  and 7-5 on fridays.  We had agreed to that before she left.
 
I also filled her in on our situation as a company, she had no idea.  I didn't want her to get blindsided by any kind of decision.

Hi.  I talked to Julie Kearney about my hours.  She said 7 to 1 is 30 hours a week and I need to work 32 hours a week to keep my benefits the way I have them.  Would it be ok if I worked 7 to 1:30?  I'm pretty sure my babysitter can stay an extra half hour.  I'm also planning on making arrangements to work later on the last 3 days of each month to set up for the new month.   

Let me know what you think.  You can email me back or call me.  I'll be home for about one hour and then I have an appt. 591-9681 Talk to you soon.
