Why don't we try 10 ish for coffee or brunch or whatnot?

My cell is 503-701-2894 just in case.

Can't wait!

I would love to get together with you - Saturday would be probably the best
time because my company plans on leaving Saturday morning - call me at
466-5573(my home number) so we can do lunch or something.




Hi Susan,

I am going to be in Spokane from Wednesday Night thru Sunday morning, I
would really like to get together for coffee or something.

Are you going to be in town?

Cara
