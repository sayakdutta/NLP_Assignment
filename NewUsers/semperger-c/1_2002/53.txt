Let me know if your stuff does not pull in correctly from Enpower or you have any other problems.

Thanks!

 

Cara, 

	The pos0201 spreadsheet is out there.   We will use CRC as an upstream at Mead 230 HLH and El Paso Electric as an upstream at Four Corners LLH for wheeling to Pinnacle Peak.  AEP has been selected as the upstream for all other requirements.

Thanks 

Mark
