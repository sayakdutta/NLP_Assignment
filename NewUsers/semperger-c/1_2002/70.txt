I want to go to the 10 am meeting, as I am Cara Freeland now.

My divorce papers were all done yesterday, and I will have final copies to you guys for your records in a month or so.

Please plan to attend the local UBS HR Presentation given by Gabrielle Hagele and Chris Lue tomorrow, Thursday, 1/24/02 at 2:00 PM in the Mt. Hood Conference Room.  The presentation will detail UBS Benefits and UBS HR Policies.  Time is also set aside for Question and Answers.  

Several UBS HR required forms will be distributed during this meeting.  These forms are required to process payroll and enroll in the benefit plans.  If you are unable to attend this meeting, please contact me or one of the UBS HR personnel.   See you then!
