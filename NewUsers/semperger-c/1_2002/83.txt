Congratulations Steve!  How wonderful!  I love the name.  




She missed the tax deduction for 2001, and she missed being a New Year's baby, but we'll probably keep her just the same.  Mom and baby are doing fine.  Dad is still assessing.




Annabelle Grace Swain was born 01/02/02, (she and Kylie Kennedy can compete over whos birthday is on the worst date). She weighs 7lbs and is 20 inches long. Labor was 2 and a half hours (23 hours with Jethro). So far she's treating us right.
 
Lisa and Steve
