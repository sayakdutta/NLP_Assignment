Kam, David, and Errol -
Please forward to me your region's access criteria no later than 11:00 am, 
Monday, March 19  (see request below from Tuesday). We need to pull 
everyone's access information together in order to plan Security requirements 
for the Trader Web-site. Thank you for your help!

Team -
Please provide me your list of names for each trader that should have "View 
Access" for your region on the Trader web-site to be developed.  If you also 
need "Update Access, in addition to view access" please provide a separate 
list for those as well. 

Please send me your lists by end of day tomorrow (Wed, 3/14) if possible, or 
let me know when you can provide the information.  Thank you for your help!!
Shirley
