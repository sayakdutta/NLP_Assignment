12:30 at Treebeards works for me.  If you call me before you leave, I'll
walk
over with you.

It appears everybody can do lunch tomorrow (the 28th).  Send me what times
work for you and a suggestion of a central place to eat.  Any time is good
for me.  My best guess for a central location would be Treebeards in the
tunnel, but anyplace is fine with me.  Let me know.
