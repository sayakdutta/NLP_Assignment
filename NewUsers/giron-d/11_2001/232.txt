Absoulutely.  When the Texas Monthly article came out, ENE was around $30.  We have been told basically nothing.  Which is not unlike what has been going on during the entire collapse........At least they are consistent.  But we did have attorneys describing what Ch 11 would be like, so I suspect it is only a matter of time until the filling.  We shall see.

I guess that Texas Monthly writer will be up for the Pulitzer.

Have they told y'all anything?
