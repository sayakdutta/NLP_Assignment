 

Here is a test of several items you have learned in the Excel class so far.

I have set up a basic program structure for you that opens a file and reads the file, line by line, into the variable "sBuf".

You should write functions that tally the results asked for on Sheet1  (number of lines in the file, number of characters, etc).  A user should be able to enter a search (source) string.  Given the string you should also search for how many times it occurs in the file under 3 different conditions (case-sensitive, case-insensitive and as a "word" - separated by blanks).

You should have all the basic concepts down to complete the program fairly easily.  Work on this project and we will discuss it on the Monday following Thanksgiving.

I will be out tomorrow and next week.

Have fun!




 

HERE IT IS.
