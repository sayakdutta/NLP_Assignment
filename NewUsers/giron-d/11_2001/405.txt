I was sorry to hear about your mother.  I tried to call last night but you were not at home.  I told mom and she asked for your number.  I don't know if you have heard, but Enron was purchased by Dynegy on Friday.  The deal will not close until Q3 '02, but this will obviously affect me in some manner.  We will see.  Take care.
