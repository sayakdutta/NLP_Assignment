Congratulations!  Enron will most likely file Ch 11.  Either today or tomorrow.  It's pretty crazy.  I really don't know what the future holds.  I will just have to wait and see.  We definitely want to go skiing.  Most likely in the spring.  I may have to wait and see how this thing plays out though.  I am going to Dallas on Saturday and we may stay at your sisters place.  They sure kicked the shit out of the Huskers.  I'll keep in touch.

Darron,
 
What's up?  I do not know if your  mother told you, but Tracie and I are expecting in June!  We are very  excited.
 
I know it is probably a sore subject, but  what the hell is going on with Enron?  Are you looking for another job or  are you not effected?
 
Let me know if you guys are planning to  go skiing again this year.  I will keep my eyes open for deals.  
 
I'll talk to you later and watch out for  those Buffaloes on Saturday night!
 
Sean
