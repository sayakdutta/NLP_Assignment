As I stated on the phone, the deal is valid and Enron will honor its terms .  I will get a confirmation sent to you.  Thanks

As we discussed, I never received a confirmation of the May, June and July
forward gas purchase (1,000 per day at Ventura at $2.895/mmBtu).  This
purchase was made through Brian Frihart.  I need to know if Enron plans to
stand behind this purchase.  Without confirmation, I will assume that the
deal is no longer valid.
