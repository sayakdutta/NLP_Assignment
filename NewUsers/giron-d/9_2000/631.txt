Again this month, you are going to have to calculate your basis positions 
(officialize) twice.  Once for the TDS download, and once for the Benchmark 


tonight,  and 50% tommorrow.  I would recommend that you use two different 
post ID's to do this.  That way you can use your 100% calc for your curve 
shift report and it will reflect any change in prompt month index as curve 
shift and not a change deal.  We will need two calcs until indexes are set.  
Just to be clear,  calc your 100% basis calc first.  Officialize.  Load your 
positions into TDS. Unofficialize. Calc your 50% basis calc.  Officialize.  
Run all reports off of the 100% basis calc. 

Also,  we will roll-off 50% of all index positions (Gas Daily and Physical) 
tonight and roll-in 50% of physical and gas daily index.  And the other 50% 
tommorrow.  

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Jeff
