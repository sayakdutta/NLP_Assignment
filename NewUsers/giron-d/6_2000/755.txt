Darron,

Befire a book can be added to TAGG, it has to be added to Global Counterparty.

Attached please find an example of a request that is sent Global 
Counterparty.  Once
the book is added to Global Counterparty, an e-mail is sent to Ricky Dang 
from Global
and he adds to to TAGG.

Give me a call if you have any questions.

Thanks, Ron
