Hector,
Kimberly S. Olinger is listed as reporting to me in the PEP system.  She 
should be moved to Jeff Gossett.  Thanks.

Please send us the names of the employees that should be listed as your 
direct reports.    Please cc your supervisor and we will forward the 
information so that changes can be made.  
Thanks, hgm


   
	
	
		



Hector,
I don't believe I am set up to review as a supervisor in the PEP system.  How 
do I get this changed in the system?  Let me know.  Thanks
DG
