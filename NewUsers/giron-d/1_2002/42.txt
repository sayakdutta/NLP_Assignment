Sorry.  I've got a UBS meeting all day.  Catch you later.  I was looking forward to the conversation.

It seems everyone agreed to Ninfa's.  Let's meet at 11:45; let me know if a
different time is better.  Ninfa's is located in the tunnel under the JP
Morgan Chase Tower at 600 Travis.  See you there.
