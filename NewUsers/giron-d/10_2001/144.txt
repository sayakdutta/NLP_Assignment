About a third, that's why I'm being shipped to OK.

By the way, how much of the $1BN is your fault?

I leave Thurs morning and return Friday night.  I don't know why I typed
Friday.

   You're in OK on Friday, so you can't make lunch Thursday?

   Great, just as I say my schedule is open, it closes.  I will be in the
   great state of Oklahoma on Friday, so I will have to cancel.  If I was
   going, it would be Zydeco all the way!

      Well, it looks like the 18th is good for everybody, although I may be
   a
      little late or have to leave early, depending on when we meet.  Noon
      works
      best for me if that is alright with everyone.  I would suggest
   somewhere
      around the Bank One or Shell buildings as the most central to all.
      Restaurants around there include Zydeco, Beck's Prime, a Chinese
   place
      in 2
      Shell, or Luther's.  Let me know your preference.
