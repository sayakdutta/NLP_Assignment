It looks like we won't make it to Austin before the 1st.  I'll probably just ask you to leave the tix under your front door matt on the day of the NMSU game and we will stop by to pick them up.  I will verify this with you next week.  I can't believe the season is already upon us.  Any word on OU?

Thanks
DG

I may be in Austin later this summer.  I'm in no hurry to get the tickets.
If you will, please hang on to them and I'll advise at a later date.
Thanks.
