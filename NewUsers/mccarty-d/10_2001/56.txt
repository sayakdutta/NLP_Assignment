Martha,
      Would you drop me a quick note and update me on your progress?  Is there anything that you need to be doing at this point?  Also give me your general feel for the market's receptiveness to date, the caliber of Luminent's staff, and how the relationship is going so far.  
       If you have some available time next week, call Julie and get on my calendar.  Thanks.

Dan
