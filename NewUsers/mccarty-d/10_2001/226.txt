Since to bulk of these will be used for employees, I'd like to try and get 20-plus tickets through Deb---not hospitality ones.

 

Danny:

If we want individual tickets, we should make the request through Deb.  $60.00 and $70.00 range.

Otherwise, please see the Group Ticket packages.

Bronze $4000 = $200 per ticket

Web site shows $60 & $40 tickets are sold out.

No tickets are available (at this time) on the Huskers web site.

Please advise.
