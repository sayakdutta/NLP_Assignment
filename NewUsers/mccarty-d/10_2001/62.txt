It's up to you now.



Mark, 
     I hate losing Steve, but the most important thing is keeping him here.  As you know, he was an EDS employee assigned to Enron until about 1999.  As such, he didn't receive all of the equity upsides that his counterparts did.  I know a lot of people  have, and will continue to, make runs at Steve.  So do what you can to keep him a happy Enron employee.  Thanks.
 
Dan




Stan/Danny,
 
I tried to call you today to let you see the announcement I am running on a number of org changes including Steve Hotte. Unfortunately you were both in the air and I am away next week, so I've run it anyway. I'm pretty sure we have all the bases covered and  you guys wont have any problem with it.
 
Best Regards
