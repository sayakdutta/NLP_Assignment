Joel,
      I truly wish that I had something in my shop for you, but I don't.  Try Geoff Roberts at Entergy (281)-297-3120, Rich Kinder at Kinder Morgan (713)369-9000, or you could try Anadarko in the Woodlands.  I know that Duke is still hiring, too.  The other alternative is to look outside the industry, which is probably a good idea at this point.  You could also contact Joe Sutton and see if you could get some leads from him.  In any event, let me know if there is something that I can do.  I wish you the best of luck in your search--we'll keep you in our prayers until we've heard that you're fine, so let us know.

     Take care.

Dan

 

Ever really want someone to wake you up from a bad dream...

The good news is Enron Freight is no longer one of the non-core business entities on the fence. The bad news is we fell on the wrong side of the fence. The word is, basically, sell yourselves to someone or liquidate.

Any suggestions on where I should start looking?

Our house hasn't sold in Indy yet, but the job market there is pretty slim. Think we'll go ahead and plan to stay here in Houston.

Any ideas?

Thanks.

Joel
