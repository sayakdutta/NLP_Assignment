Bob,
    Would you copy me when you send the first draft, I'd like to get a better feel for it.  Thanks.

Byron and Paul, Eric Gadd has turned the ball over to me on the B to C joint project sponsored by El Paso, Enron and TCPL.  To get things moving, I could take the development agreement that El Paso and Northern Border negotiated 3 years ago on the Illinois-Wisconsin Pipeline Project and make a few wording adjustments and then offer it to each of you as a first draft of the B-C project development agreement. Let me know how that sounds.  Bob Hill. 402-398-7888. 




Unfortunately, my travel plans have changed and I will now be in transit at
the time of the call this afternoon.  Please send me any results and let me
know if I have any specific assigments.

Thanks,
