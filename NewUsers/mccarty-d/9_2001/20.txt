Hello,

I am in the process of establishing a Contact List for the Withdrawn
partners.  Would you please check the information I have on you and confirm
that it is correct and would you supply any information that is missing.

Also, would you indicate what function each individual is responsible for
eg. , MOU, Technical, Regulatory, Commercial or Legal.  I will update the
list once I have more information.  Thanks very much for your help.
