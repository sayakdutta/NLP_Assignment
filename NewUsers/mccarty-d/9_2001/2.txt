Bob,
      I've not kept up with Brian for the past several years.  I can say, that during the four years that Brian worked for me, he created value every year without having tasks and opportunities handed to him.  In fact, even in his worst year, he created $6.5m.  Brian really  started our currency arb's (US/Canadian) in 1992 when we worked on Sithe.  The concept of a "virtual power station" was co-created by Brian and Joe Gold (his associate) when they sold a virtual pump storage to National Power Ltd. after their failed attempt purchase an actual pump storage in the UK (trading peak against off-peak spreads seems to be no great feat today, but no one had ever done one in 1996).  A lot of what we've done the past few years stems back to many of the ground breaking things that Brian and Joe started ( including the way that we structured the tolling agreements surrounding our Sutton Bridge Plant in the UK). 
      As for enemies at Enron---I think that they are all gone (Ken, Amanda, Cliff, John Stokes and crew).  I think that Mark Frevert still thinks highly of Brian and understands that Brian was put in a bad situation (being put in the middle of the Ken and Amanda thing).
      I do know that Brian has turned around his life quite significantly--he's very Christian and has a lot less ego than he once had.  If I could hire him back, I would.  I'd just cut him loose, ask him to make me $6.0m/yr., and he'd deliver me $10.0m/yr.  I'd take as many of those kind of people that you could find for me.
      Let me know if I can help further.

Dan 

 

Brian called me last week and shared that you had suggested he call.  As you
know, he has some significant holes in his resume' and has a few enemies
within the Enron family.  I never worked with him so I don't know his
genuine abilities.  Could you shed some light on your experience with Mr.
Barrington.
Thanks,
