But that allows all parties to game the system rather than to bid the capacity at a value that is compatible with the individual party's economics.  Or does FERC not see that as a driver (values at which a willing buyer and a willing seller would transact).  This would always put a Seller at a disadvantage.

I agree it uses an interactive tool, ie  hottap, but I feel what FERC wants is interactive bidding on the posted capacity, so that all have a chance to see others bids and anti up their bid-  EOL doesn't allow that-  MK

But isn't that exactly what "interactive" means??

I don't think we can call EOL an interactive open season, since once clicked it is sold-

Drew, We need to be careful that we do not provide a marketing affiliate advanced information on capacity availability through EOL.  Joe

Steve, do you see a problem with using EOL as the IOS process for the operational capacity deals?  I don't propose that we get into this level of detail with Staff at this time, but if they like the overall proposal, at some point we'll need to let them know that what we mean by IOS is the EOL process.  (I don't see why we'd have to design a new IOS from scratch if EOL works fine)  Is anyone nervous that the idea of using EOL as part of our capacity posting and sales process will make it harder to sell a settlement to the Indicated Shippers?

I am OK with this but with one note. The interactive open season (IOS) mentioned in 1.b. will most likely utilize Enron Online going forward. The current IOS process is no longer available because of system changes. Therefore, any new IOS system will cost us some investment($?).
