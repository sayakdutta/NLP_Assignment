Hello John!  I appreciate the recommendation, but I am not in the position right now to make a move.  If they are interested in discussing a position here in the NW, I would be more interested in that.  I hope everything is going well for you.  

Keep in touch!

Diana




Diana; last week my boss and I met with Sean regarding a position within
PG&E similar to what you're currently doing.  PG&E would be very interested
talking to you but the catch is the job is located in Bethesda Maryland.
Are you at all interested, and secondly would you and Sean consider residing
in Bethesda performing the exact same function you are both performing
today?  The second option is a long shot but I wanted to run it by you.
Hopefully you had a pleasant Holiday.   John
