Dear Portland Friends,
 
I am sorry I did not have to opportunity to say good-bye in person, so I am sending this message instead.  I am hoping that this message reaches all of you.  
 
It has been my privilege to have been able to work with and represent you in the various western region forums that were of interest to Enron.  I want to wish all of you the best for the future and if any group of individuals can make a new Enron work again it would be you.  I have learned a lot in my brief tenure at Enron and it has been especially satisfying working with professionals like each of you.  Hopefully sometime in the future our paths will cross again.
 
Happy Holidays to you and your families.  Also, if someone could also pass along this message to Cara S. in scheduling it would be much appreciated. (I cannot remember how to spell her last name...sorry Cara!)
 
Kindest Regards,
 
Dave
