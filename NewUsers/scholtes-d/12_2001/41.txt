Diana-

  We seem to be off on both Purchases and Sales for November '01 for Modesto.  I'm thinking it may have to do with the $26 deal....(?)

  Can you look over these numbers and tell me if you agree with Modesto.  Given everything that has happened lately, I'm not sure who is correct.

  Thanks,

  Virginia

Gwen,

Please confirm my November 2001 numbers.  I show that MID purchased 26,800 MWh's at $2,089,704.00 from Enron and MID had sales to Enron of 23,520 MWh's at $2,225,962.36.  If you agree with my numbers, I will net invoice Enron for 3,280 MWh's for $136,258.36.
