Hey Young!

Perfect timing I tell you, Natalie came down with the croup.  Hence I'm staying here to take care of her cuz Dad's out of town also.  Real bummer because there's a lot of fun going to happen up there!  Have a good time!  Maybe we can go hiking around here!

Hi!

I'm thinking  about going for a hike, around the lake, Thursday afternoon.
The area supposed to be very pretty.  Do you already have a plan?
