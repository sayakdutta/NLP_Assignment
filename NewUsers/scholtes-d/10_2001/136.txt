9/23	Bill C. fixed this day and we check

9/24	To MPC-EPMI Colstrip s/b priced with the .10 cent adder peak & off peak

	* OK for the hard part!  our nets are ok for the balance of the problem but they aren't priced correctly.


	You have them dispursed between several accounts:	 To BPA-EPMI (PGE sys)= 497 mw


Purchases= $ 156,755.00
Sales= $ 147,439.00

9/25	I BELIEVE OUR INDICES ARE OFF- I SHOW 18.98 PEAK & 16.60 OFF PEAK????  Every account you have on this day is off. Or maybe I have the wrong index!
