 Normally, the bill of sale is used to transfer personal property and the 
deed to transfer real property.  If we are only selling the real property, no 
bill of sale is needed.

p.s.  we are not selling a pipeline at all.  just the fee property on which
no pipelines exist.  tell me where I lost you and I'll be happy to clarify
further.

thanks, Dan.

Where is your earnest money contract?  Isn't the information therein.  I
was not aware that we were selling a pipeline to anyone.  Please advise?

While I'm in the process of getting the appropriate information for Mr.
Earp, one question.  Shouldn't we also have a bill of sale to accompany
this document, registering the value to be paid for this property?

Pls advise.
