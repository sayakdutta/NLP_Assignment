The GTC confirm that we sent to them did not require them to sign.  It is

Did they ever sign the new gas agreement.  They have prepaid for February.

My understanding, after discussing the matter with Jim Carr, is that the

Regarding Court approval neither of us believe it is reguired.



WHAT ARE WE DOING RE THE GAS AGREEMENT?
