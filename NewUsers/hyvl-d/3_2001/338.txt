Darren,
 I left this in my email inbox for some reason.  It is my recollection that 
we talked about this and I asked you to have them make the changes they were 
requesting to make to their form and send us a final executed document.  Is 
that correct?

and make the changes that you see fit. I will send it to the counterparty 
when you are done.
