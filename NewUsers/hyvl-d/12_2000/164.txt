Again, this matter is of significant importance to Credit, as deals are being 
executed on a daily basis and the exposure just keeps climbing.  Can you 
please review their form of a gty in order for us to receive executed copies.

Dan and Craig,

Can you please take a look at Tenaska's incoming gty format, as their 
guarantor has changed and subsequently new gty's need to be issued for both 
ENA and ECC.  As the current gty's expire at the end of the month, it is 
imperative that we give Tenaska feedback as soon as we are able to in order 
to have the gty's executed on their end.  The gty format is attached in the 
email below.

Thanks again for your prompt attention,

Veronica Espinoza

As we discussed on Friday below is our form guaranty.  Please review and get
