Dan,

Enermetrix will be matching us up with the Buyers.  We would have the right 
to perform a credit check and turn around in 48 hours however we should know 
the counterparty before we submit a bid.  This would be for both gas and 
power.  Additionally, the agreement that I sent to you was already negotiated 
by EES and has concessions in it that can speed up the process.

Lets discuss.
