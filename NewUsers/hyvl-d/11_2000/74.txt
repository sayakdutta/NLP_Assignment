What is the status of the credit worksheet for this counterparty?  Looks as 
if we need a Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement.  Please advise?

Okay, I wasn't sure who to route this to, but one of our traders gave Claire 
Neri at UGI my name and number to help with information about our contracts. 
As it turns out, we do not have a Master Contract with UGI but have a firm 
term deal  attached to a GTC (Deal #345010, running from 11/1/00 - 3/31/01, 


UGI's hope is to get a Master agreement in place ASAP to cover the above 
mentioned deal & any new inter gas deals (since she sent their master, I'm 
assuming that their intent is to put their master in place ASAP). Claire Neri 
can be reached at 610-796-3505 for additional information of 
changes/negotiations. 

Note: UGI is also an EOL "Investment Grade" counterparty for non-Texas natual 
gas.
