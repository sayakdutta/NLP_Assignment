Dan,

Per the earlier e-mail, Jason's intention was to send this information on 
this transaction to the confirm group, as listed below - Joe Hunter and Janie 
Aquayo.  Jason is a new person in the Credit Group and was responding to a 
transaction that we were looking into for credit approval.  There is no 
additional credit information that is required to be placed in this confirm 
for this transaction, as is occasionally added by your group.

Thanks
Russell

Please explain, confirms are sent out by the confirm desk.  why is this sent 
to legal.  If you send us a credit worksheet, we can prepare a Master Firm 
Purchase Sale Agreement and once it is signed then a confirm can be issued to 
cover the proposed transaction; however, if you want us to work on the 
confirm, please send us a hard copy of deal ticket.  Otherwise the deal 
number is greek.
