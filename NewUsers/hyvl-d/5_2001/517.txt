Janet,
 The amendment is effective as of June 1, 2001.  That is the date on which 
the price changes and the date that the term is extended and the date the 
meter number is added.  I have corrected the contract number on the first 
line for the proper reference to the assigned contract.

Looks good....does it cover the  the pricing of $3.155 begins 6/01?
