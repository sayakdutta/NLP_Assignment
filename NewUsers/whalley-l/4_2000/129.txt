Yes, we watch the game from the rooftop.  You can also with your pass go into 
the stadium.

Does this mean tickets to the game as well, or can we see the game from 
there?  Sign me up for two tickets tentatively.

Thanks

Please contact me about the numbers of tickets you will need.  We may be able
