I think you would be a great candidate.

 

any interest?

 

Rob, I'm on the committee putting together this year's Power Institute sponsored by the South Texas College of Law.  As we do not have any speakers from Enron scheduled this year, I thought I would check with you to see if there is any interest in participating on the general counsel panel referenced in the proposed agenda contained in the attached fax.  Please let me know as soon as possible, as they apparently plan to finalize the agenda today.  Thanks.
