OK.

 

How about:  May, 22, 23, 24, 29 or 30th?  S

 

Yes. The attendees are Mark Haedicke, Jordan Mintz, Kristina Mordaunt, Rex Rogers, Richard Sanders, Rob Walls, Bob Williams, and me.  Let's discuss the proposed dates in May before you take any action. Thank you.

 

Do you want to do this again?  If so, who do I invite.  I have forgotten who all were attending the last time.  S

 


Hello Stephanie,  how are you doing?  Can you check with Jim to see if we can come up with a date some time in May for a visit from Ed Feo, Eric Silverman and Mel?  I remembered that Jim had asked to wait until April to resume our efforts in tryng to schedule this.  Thanks.  Best regards.
