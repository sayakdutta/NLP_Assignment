Gail, thank you for your fine work on this, and congratulations on the great result! Jim

 

	As an aside, from a litigation perspective, A&K did a very good job.  They were responsive in filing the arbitration demand and did a great job applying for and obtaining an injunction against a proposed sale of some of the IHI assets which, in turn, facilitated IHI's coming to the table to negotiate a possible resolution of the matter.

the arbitration proceeding filed with respect to this ena investment (which andrews and kurth filed for us), has been settled quickly in our favor with gail's assistance. this is the matter which we felt would not get actually litigated in the context of selection of counsel and wanted to confirm back this was the case.
