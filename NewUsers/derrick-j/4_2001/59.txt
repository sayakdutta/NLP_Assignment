David,  I think this e-mail is for you.   Thanks

Please email me a  list of the adverse banks.  We represent a number of banks in an acctg  malpractice case against PWC, but we have in each of our fee agreements, a  waiver of their right to object to us suing them on an unrelated matter.  I  am available for a meeting any time next Thurs. or Friday.
