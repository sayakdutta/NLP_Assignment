FYI. Jim

 

Jim,  I cannot thank you enough for those incredibly kind words.  It will t=
ake a bit of time for my frustration to subside, but in the meantime we mus=
t carry on.  I am arranging a meeting with Jonathan to see if he can shed s=
ome light on this strange opinion and on why we were denied our costs on th=
e restitution point.  He may not be available until after Easter.  I have s=
poken to Laurence who describes the opinion as pathetic.  Perhaps even more=
 interesting and somewhat troubling is the fact that it was actually Pollac=
k who said to Laurence that Enron had been "stitched up" by the Lords and t=
hat the opinion was a joke.  I do not want to sound like a sore loser, but =
it does make one think this is a bit of a kangaroo court if the winning cou=
nsel says the result is a joke.  Anyway, it is not a very funny one.  In al=
l seriousness perhaps we should consider whether we ought to modify our pol=
icy permitting submitting to the exclusive jurisdiction of the English cour=
ts.  I realize they have not historically honored the non-exclusive jurisdi=
ction clauses, but at least it might give us a fighting chance to go to a m=
ore neutral venue like Switzerland.  Anyway, give it some thought.  I will =
let you know as soon as I have been able to speak with Jonathan.  Again, ma=
ny thanks for your wonderful support every step of the way.




Mary Nell, no one could have worked harder or better than you in the effort=
 to bring about a just decision in this matter.  Thank you for your tireles=
s efforts--I am proud to serve on the Enron team with you. All the best. Ji=

Disappointingly, the House of Lords ruled 5 - 0 against Enron in the CATS l=
itigation today.  This will mean that we will repay to the CATS parties app=
roximately $150 million plus interest and court costs, putting the final fi=
gure at an estimated $155-160 million.  We expect to be invoiced for the pr=
incipal amount in the next week or so; sorting costs and interest may take =
as long as 60 days.  The written opinion reflects a determination on the pa=
rt of the Lords to rule against us regardless of what the contract says.  T=
he opinion seeks to conclude "what rational businessmen could have intended=
" rather than applying the provisions of the contract. =20

For example, Lord Hoffman (author of the primary opinion) makes it clear th=
at the  "retrospective consequences" of discovering a latent defect after p=
ayments have been made (and would therefore need to be refunded) are unacce=
ptable.  His view seems to be that because we were not ready to flow J-Bloc=
k gas during the period of the T-6 leak, we are not damaged and therefore n=
ot entitled to relief under the contract.  Furthermore, he says that the Co=
mmencement Date notice sent by the CATS parties was in the nature of a decl=
aration and as long as it is sent in good faith it is effective.

As far as the price reduction formula in Clause 7.5, Lord Hoffman opines th=
at the clause is not operative until TGTL had tied in the J-Block field.  T=
he contract makes no reference to this requirement.  Hoffman's view is that=
 it is only upon tie-in that the CATS parties' obligation to provide the Tr=
ansportation Service is triggered and therefore there can be no price reduc=
tion for not providing the service unless tie-in is complete. This statemen=
t is in stark contrast with Hoffman's earlier statement in the opinion that=
 upon the giving of the Commencement Date notice the CATS parties have an a=
bsolute obligation to provide the Transportation Service.

Equally disappointing and surprising is the fact that the Lords rejected ou=
r submission for reimbursement of our costs incurred in connection with the=
 restitution issue.  As you may recall, restitution was the primary issue u=
pon which the CATS parties obtained leave to appeal, and they conceded the =
point at the commencement of the hearing.  Reimbursement of these costs sho=
uld have been a given.=20

Although I have not yet been able to speak to our most senior barrister, ou=
r other counsel have assessed the opinion as "appalling" and "pathetic," an=
d describe the situation as one where Enron has been "stitched up".  Unfort=
unately, given that this is the court of last resort in this country (excep=
t of course the Court of Human Rights), there is not an avenue for recourse=
.

In conclusion may I say that although we did not get the result we wanted o=
r expected from the House of Lords, I very much appreciate all the support =
from each of you for these past six years.  The case has been a roller coas=
ter ride;  I hope our earlier victory in the Court of Appeal will evidence =
in fact that some tribunals in this country recognize that we did get it ri=
ght.=20

Please call me if you wish to discuss the case in any further detail, or if=
 you wish to have a copy of the opinion.  My telephone number is 011 44 207=
