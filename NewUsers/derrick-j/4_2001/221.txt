Ann, I have left you a voice mail re your question.  Jim

 

I previously mentioned to you that Enron may have to enter into a consent d=
ecree with the FCC relating to Enron's failure to file for authorization to=
 transfer FCC licenses held by Portland General Corporation in connection w=
ith the 1997 merger.  Before the FCC prepares a draft consent decree they a=
sked that we submit a proposed Compliance Program.  V&E prepared the attach=
ed compliance program and summary.  As you can see by the date on the e:mai=
l from Bob Mazer I have had the draft for a couple weeks and have not revie=
wed it until today.  I have spoken to a couple people in Regulatory Affairs=
 to see if they would be interested in taking ownership of this compliance =
program.  They don't want it. Sue Nord, who covers EBS for regulatory affai=
rs, is checking with outside counsel used by EBS to see if they agree that =
we must enter into the consent decree.  I am concerned about Enron's abilit=
y to implement this program and want to get your prospective on it.  I am a=
lso concerned about whether or not we have other violations that will come =
to light after we sign the consent decree.  As far as I can tell, at this p=
oint Enron doesn't have a centralized system for tracking FCC licenses.  Pl=
ease let me know what you think the next steps should be for reviewing this=
 compliance program and responding to V&E. =20

As requested. Best regards, Bob Mazer
