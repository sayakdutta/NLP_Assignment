Steph, am I available on the 17th?

 


Mr. Derrick,

Our firm has been retained by Enron on a variety of matters over the last few years but we have not yet met.  I will be in your Houston offices on Tuesday, April 17th.  I am writing to ask if you would be available to meet sometime that afternoon.

You may recall meeting my partner, Mike Morgan, in Portland about three to four years ago.  Mike has worked with Enron on the PGE/Sierra deal and other matters as well.

I am the senior partner at our firm who specializes in labor and employment law.  I am a former partner at Littler Mendelson in San Francisco and continue to enjoy a close relationship with that firm.

I have been working with Rick Johnson, Director of Labor and Employment Relations at Enron Corp.  We have been handling the labor issues associated with an energy management agreement--Project Neon.  Rich Freed is lead counsel.  We are working on a project labor agreement in connection with the construction of a power plant--Project Epic.  Randy Pais is overseeing that matter.  We are also working with Marty Keyser on some potential  O & M issues at EFS.

On April 17th, I will be having lunch with Michelle Cash, Sharon Butcher, Kriste Sullivan and Rick.  In the morning I will be meeting with representatives of EFS, EES and EEOS.

My flight on the 17th leaves at about 5:30 pm.  Rick and I would be available to stop by your office sometime after lunch on the 17th.

Please let me know if you are available to meet with us.  I look forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Victor Kisch
