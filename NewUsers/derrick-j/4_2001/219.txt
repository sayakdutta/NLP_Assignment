Pat, as we know, February can be a very difficult month from the standpoint of weather, which affects not only travel to and from the event but also any outside activities during the event.  Do we have any flexibility with respect to the month in which the institute is held?  If it is to be held in February, I would opt to try Houston, New Orleans, or Santa Fe. I suggest that, if possible, we avoid scheduling the conference on Valentines Day or any holiday.  All the best.  Jim Derrick

As you know, the Institute in San Antonio this year was the first Institute
ever held outside of Dallas.  We are now planning next year's Institute, and
we would appreciate your input -- as a member of the Advisory Board -- on

within the next 2 days with your preference among the following options:

Dallas
Houston
San Antonio
Austin
Oklahoma City
New Orleans
Santa Fe

FYI:  The preferences of the Institute attendees who turned in their
evaluation forms were as follows:

Houston -- 15
San Antonio -- 13
New Orleans -- 13
Santa Fe -- 11
Austin -- 8
Dallas -- 6
Oklahoma City -- 4

Thank you for your reply.  We'll let you know after we've tallied the
results.
