Gary, I have been out of the office and have just seen your message.  I will be pleased to forward it to Cindy Olson,  the head of our Human Resources Group.  Good luck to Pete; if he wants to visit about Enron some time, have him call me. All the best.  Jim

 Jim:    I trust this message finds you doing well.  Attached is my son
Pete's resume. Pete is in the first semester of his Senior year at Baylor
University and is  looking for a Summer Internship in an area that will
utilize his Finance/Economics undergraduate training. Your consideration of
Pete's resume and sharing it with the appropriate contacts at Enron and
affiliated entities would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
