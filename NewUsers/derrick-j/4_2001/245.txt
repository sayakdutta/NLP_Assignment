Mont, I regret that I will not be able to attend.  Jim

 

This is to remind you of the HCFR meeting on Thursday, April 19, 2001 from 6:30 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. at the River Oaks Country Club, Pool Room.  Dr. Murray Weidenbaum will be the speaker and his topic will be:  "A U.S. Trade Policy for the 21st Century."

If you have not done so, please r.s.v.p. to me or Mont Hoyt. Thank you.
