If you know of such a person, please respond to Monsanto.  Thank you. Jim

 

Monsanto has need for a very strong lawyer to handle an effort by a state
official to politicize our biotechnology. We need a lawyer who can related
to the intersections of law, public affairs, government affairs and
regulatory. We will need to find the right person in the next few days. Any
help with names would be greatly appreciated.
