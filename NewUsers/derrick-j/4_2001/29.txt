Thank you, Steph.  

 

JVD, just wanted to tell you how much I am enjoying my little medicine ball.  I walk around with it a lot.  When I am on the telephone, it substitutes for a doodle.  As a matter of fact, I just got back from doing the stairs and on about the second floor, I realized I was holding it. It has kind of taken the place of a "worry rock" .  In the meantime, it is providing me with the much needed strength and dexterity in my arm, wrist and hand.  

Thanks again for all you do for me.  I love working for you.  You are a very sweet man and I appreciate it.
