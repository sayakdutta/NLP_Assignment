Nancy, I suggest we take the Four Seasons option.  Jim








it doesn't look like there is a strong preference of where we hold the
meeting.  i was thinking that if we did have the meeting at the four
seasons, we could go with carrin's idea of having a party that evening --
possibly margaritas on sixth street?  just an idea.
