John, I think Stan would be fine.  Please call Vince Buckley at Locke Liddell 
with the request to involve Stan.  Jim




Jim,                      Corporate Aviation has been intructed by the Office 
of the Chairman to sell three of its aircraft.  At least one sales will occur 
in the 4th quarter of 2000.  Any sale not completed in the 4th quarter  will 
probably close in the 1st or 2nd quarter of 2001.  The aircraft to be sold  
are currently in structured finance transactions that will need to be 
unwound.  It is my understanding that Stan Pieringer of Locke Liddell & Sapp 
helped put together two of the three transactions that need to be unwound and 
is otherwise familiar with structures of this nature.           In order to 
accomplish the unwinding of the transactions, I believe it is appropriate to 
engage outside counsel.  Given Stan Pieringer's faimiliarty with the type of 
structures to be unwound, I recommend engaging him and his firm for the 
project.   Please advise if engaging Stan Pieringer and Locke Liddell is 
acceptable.
