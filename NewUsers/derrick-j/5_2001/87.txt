Chuck, the binder has been under review, but the policies you refer to are still in force.  Jim

Pursuant to the subject audit, AA has received copies of Policies F ("Selection and Retention of Outside Counsel") and Q ("Claims, Litigation and Related Proceedings") and related exhibits from the Enron Legal Department Policy Binder which was distributed in November 1994. While these policies appear to me to remain applicable and to be consistent with statements in the Enron Code of Ethics, AA was under the impression that either these particular legal department policies or the binder itself have been more recently reissued.

I am not aware of any later editions of the particular policies or the binder. Are either of you?
