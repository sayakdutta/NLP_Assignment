Marc, I met this morning with an acquaintance, Eric Johnson, with respect to a product that he thought might be of interest to Enron. In our discussion it became apparent that his product is not an obvious fit with Enron, and he asked about the possibility of discussing the product with the New Power Company.  I gave him your name and number with the thought that you might direct him to the appropriate individual on the business side.  Jim
