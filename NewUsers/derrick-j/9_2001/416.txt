Nancy, I attempted earlier to send you the message below, without success.  Hopefully, this one will get through.  Jim
 

Hi, Jim--Stephanie let us know.  I'm sorry we won't get to see you, but
good luck at your board meeting, and we'll look forward to visiting in
November, if not before.

>Nancy and Tom, I received notice today that a company of which I am a
>director has scheduled a special board meeting for this Friday afternoon
>on the east coast.  I will be unable, therefore, to be in Austin for the
>Executive Committee Meeting.  Please convey my regrets and best wishes
>to those who attend.  All the best.  Jim
