Charles, I am saddened to learn that Linklaters' policy requires that your term as senior partner must soon come to an end.  I trust, however, that you will continue to be active at Linklaters, and I look forward to continuing our working relationship and friendship.  With respect to the proposed visit by Anthony Cann on Monday, I regret that I will be on the east coast on that day.  I do look forward to meeting him, either in Houston or on one of my trips to London.  All the best to you and Linklaters. Jim

My 5 year term as senior partner of Linklaters is very nearly up. Throughout
that term it has given me great pleasure to see our relationship with Enron
steadily strengthen - with a remarkable coverage across our offices.

I have much enjoyed our meetings, and particularly visiting you in Houston
with Stuart Salt, a little time ago.  I very much hope my successor, Anthony
Cann, can similarly get to know you.

It transpires that Anthony will be in Houston next Monday, and I wondered if
you would have a slot (I know this is short notice) to meet Anthony on
Monday.  I have asked Stuart to liaise with you to see if this can be
progressed.

In the meantime, can I send you and your fine company my very best wishes
for the future.
