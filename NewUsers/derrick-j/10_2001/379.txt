Paula, thank you for the update.  I have seen the V&E portion and am pleased with it.  I will see you tomorrow morning.  Jim

 

Jim - The presentation from GS and V&E was still preliminary on Friday, and Andy had also not yet seen the proposed presentation.  As such, I did not review it with Ken.  (Plus, the Agenda Review was fairly long.)  Andy set up a review session with GS and V&E for 8:30 Monday morning - let's look at it then and decide how best to brief Ken, or if we feel it is still necessary to do so based on your and Andy's previous communications with Ken.   

FYI,  GS and V&E have prepared a 20 minute joint presentation, but it will likely take longer with Q&A.  GS will present a merger market overview, a discussion of vulnerability and a discussion of defenses.  V&E willl address defenses in place as well as other possible defenses.   

Attending the Exec. Session on Tuesday morning are:
V&E	Joe Dilg
	Harry Reasoner
	Scott Wulfe
GS	Andy arranging [to come]

'See you on Monday.  Paula
