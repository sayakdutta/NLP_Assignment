Hi Jim.  I hope all is well.  I am hoping to get your consent to hire an attorney to assist me in our European efforts.  Her name is Julia Friebel.  She has excellent experience and has been through the interview process with my colleagues in Enron Europe Legal, as well as me and all of our senior managers in Germany.  She will be based in our Germany office.  Everyone who has interviewed her has proposed that we hire her.  I will fax you her resume.  I believe she will be a real asset to our team.  She has no current plans to travel to the US, so I would like to hire her prior to her having the opportunity to meet with you.  Please let me know.  Thanks, Jim.
