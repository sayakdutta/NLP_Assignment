John, thank you for the message.  Let's try to reschedule lunch.  Jim

 

Jim-I interviewed David Lang today for a summer clerkship and liked him a
lot.  Thanks for encouraging him to see K&S

Shall we try to reschedule our lunch, or do a golf game?  How's your
schedule looking?

All the best.

John
