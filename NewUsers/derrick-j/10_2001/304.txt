FYI
 

A friend of mine, Jim McCloskey, a Director at Ernst & Young, mentioned to me that one of his partners and former Vice Chairman of E&Y, Bob Herdman, was recently named Chief Accountant to the SEC and asked whether E&Y could be of any assistance with respect to the present SEC inquiry.  I told Jim that I would convey his request to the appropriate personnel.  If you or any one wanted to discuss this matter further with Jim he can be reached at 713-750-8206.

I do know that Jim had met with Jeff Skilling earlier this year to talk about opportunities in E&Y working with Enron and I think he has another meeting scheduled  in November with Rick Causey and others for a follow up presentation, all unrelated to the SEC inquiry.
