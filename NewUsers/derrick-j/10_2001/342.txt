    This is your reminder of our special meeting next Friday to continue
our long-range planning and restructuring of the IOGEC as we expand our
scope and membership to include new fields of energy law.  A number of
the issues left on the table at our mid-year meeting in August should be
resolved now as we get ready for the annual Institute in February and
begin a concurrent membership drive.  Lunch will be served.  As we have
much to discuss, the meeting may run to 4:00 or so.

    If you have not yet advised David Winn whether you will attend,

972-664-3488).

        An agenda will be sent to you next week in advance of the
meeting. Thanks again for your wisdom and your leadership.
