Dear All,

Attached please find the Minutes of Meeting of Supervisory Board dated 20 November 2001- revision 1. The Minutes were changed per Mr Jarek Astramowicz's request with the respect to the following:
1. the text of the minutes, the agenda was added , and comment that the Budget for 2002 will be approve at the next SB meeting.
2. the resolution concerning approval of the Budget for 2002 was removed (as not approved yet).
3. resolutions concerning the remuneration of Mr. Glowacki and Mr. Zarebski - vote description corrected.
4. the total number of resolutions changed from 10 to 9, after removing a resolution concerning the Budget approval.

 

You are kindly requested to sign the resolutions and send them back to ENS.

I believe that the Resolutions No. 4, 6 and 9 are not correct in terms of the text:

1. resolution no. 4 is not correct since the S.Board did not review the new (attached) changes to the budget and did not approve it. There was also an amandement to the text of the Resolution re. the line items and the total amounts exeeding the approved budget.	

I believe that the draft Budget with the new amendemends must be reviewed once again as a whole at the next Sup.Board meeting before it can be enacted.

2. Resoltuions No. 6 and 9 - the vote descritpion is not correct

Regards - Jarek
