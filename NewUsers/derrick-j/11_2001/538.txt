Paula, thank you for the update.  I assume you will coordinate with Joe Dilg re the D&O report that V&E will give at the meeting.  Thank you. Jim

 

No BoD meeting scheduled yet.  I have a note into Ken to advise me on his preference.   Haedicke knows we expect a meeting today or tomorrow, with a preference for sooner.  The items he suggested are on the agenda.   'Will keep you informed on Ken's response.  PHR
