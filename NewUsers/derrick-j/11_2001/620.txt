Mark, thank you for the information. Jim

 


Jim,

B&M are our lead firm in Japan, and are used extensively by Jane McBride, and also on a more sporadic basis by businesses in London (eg metals and the Wind business) which have operations in Japan. Enron Wind in Japan have appointed Paul Davies of B&M in Tokyo to act on a joint venture for Enron Wind in Japan.

In the summer of 2000, we undertook some basic physical gas due diligence re gas in the Ukraine utilising Baker & McKenzie's Kiev office.  This was in preparation for a potential long-term gas deal to get gas out of the Ukraine to the Romanian border (for onward sale in Romania / Poland).  B&M was the only "recognised" firm in the Ukraine.

That's it.
