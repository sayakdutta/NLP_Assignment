It looks like an Oregonian investigative reporter is trying to  put a story together suggesting that our management advised  employees that they should be investing in Enron stock through  their 401Ks (see attached note from our public affairs).   
 
Jim (or Rob), should we be conferring with Enron defense  counsel on this, and if so who?  dn

Jeff Manning at The Oregonian called to say tomorrow's newspaper will have  another report on the Enron 401(k) problems, and the connection to PGE through  the details of three lawsuits. I said nothing new, but did clarify a quote that  had appeared from PGE in the previous story Manning wrote.
 
I've copied Doug on this because the issue is getting more serious.  Manning informed me that The Oregonian has now assigned him and Gail Hill  to "charge ahead and do more on this story." They want to sit down with HR and  review documentation that proves that we have provided financial planning  counsel, that we have provided information about diversifying portfolios, etc.  This is strongly leaning in the legal area, and we would like to have  counsel before saying anything further. We can't expect much cover from Enron,  either: Manning vented to me about how no one there will return his calls.
 
Carol, Gail, Kregg and I can be available to meet early tomorrow to discuss  how to move ahead on this. Doug, let us know if sometime before noon might work  for you. Thanks.
