Jim,

We want to know how the 350MM gets shared among directors and officers if it is insufficient to pay everything.

Also, can we assume that this covers issues at foreign subsidiaries??

Thanks,

Limor

We do not provide copies of the policies.  

The Corporate indemnity is the first line of defense for the D's &O's.  If the indemnity responds, the company seeks reimbursement from the policy up to its limit.   There is no other D&O insurance above the $350,000,000, amount of insurance.

Please advise if there are further questions.

Thanks.

I need the policy and I need to know what happens if the limit of 350MM is not enough.  Where would that be addressed??? The Enron Corp. bylaws???

Kate and Larry,

	Limor Nissan in the New York office needs a copy of the Director and Officer Liability policy (or a similarily named document) for review.  Jean Michaud, a Canadian director, wants confirmation of coverage before signing documents.  Limor needs this information as quickly as possible.

Many thanks,
Laurie
