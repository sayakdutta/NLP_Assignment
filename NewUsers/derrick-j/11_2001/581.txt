Jim-On the last advance payment bond we executed in December 2000, Hartford=
 participated at a limit of $52.8 million.  A separate and specific indemni=
ty agreement was executed by Enron in favor of Hartford which contains a tr=
igger collateral call event for 100% security in the form of a letter of cr=
edit if the credit rating of Enron falls below BBB or Baa2.  (There is an o=
ption to have the bond terminated in lieu of posting a LOC, but I doubt if =
that is a viable alternative).  Hartford called today and indicated with th=
e downgrade this morning by Moody's, we are now at the edge of the trigger =
event.  They are sending a letter to the attention of your general counsel =
confirming this condition  in the indemnity agreement.  I've asked them to =
send me a telefax of the letter, which I will forward to you.  This is not =
a call for collateral at this point; Hartford simply wants to reinforce the=
 potential requirement.  I'm sending a copy of this to Joe Deffner so he wi=
ll know what is transpiring if he gets a call.

Call if you have any questions.  Thanks.
