Chris, thank you for your message; it means so much to me and to Carrin.  All the best. Jim

 


Sorry I didn't get to say hello to you in church yesterday.  With the little
guy's wiggles (and probably the big one too!) we still sit up in the
balcony.  My thoughts and prayers are with you.  Put on the armor of God and
know we are all standing by. God is with us. My best to both of you, Chris
