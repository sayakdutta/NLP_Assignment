Jim, on Friday Sydney time the Regulator withdrew  Enron Australia Finance Pty Ltd's  licence to trade power derivatives in Australia. To ensure the Directors of that company are discharging their obligations to monitor the company's solvency we have scheduled a Board meeting in Sydney for 8:30 am Monday morning Sydney time (3.30pm Sunday Houston time). If you would like to participate in the meeting please just email me the phone number  you will be on and we will call you. If you are unable to participate we will handle and keep you advised of developments. 


So we may call this meeting and other meetings without the requisite 2 Business Days Notice Period would you please sign this email at the place indicated below and fax back to me on 612 9229 2350.   

Thanks for the assistance.
