Over the past 2 years I have used Baker & McKenzie for a number of transactions executed by EEL in London. The last transaction involved a Subpart F analysis confirmation relating to a $600mil payment received by EEL associated with the Teesside PPA's.

I have not worked with them since 4th quarter 2000. 

Jim

  

 

Please respond to me at your earliest convenience. If the answer is "none" would you please tell me when and what was the last matter?
	Thanks,
