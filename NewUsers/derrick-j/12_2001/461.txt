Bob, please follow up.  Thank you. 
 



regarding information pertaining to the various lawsuits because nothing pertained specifically to me or anyone in my present group.  However, my neighbor who was an enron employee and then a contract employee told me last week that he was contacted by an outside person seeking infomation.  My neighbor developed the model or package that performed calculations on the Chewco partnership.  I asked him if he had told anyone at Enron that he was approached by an outside party and since he was no longer employed there he didn't get the email and had not.  If you would be so kind to tell me who he should contact, he will.  He told me that Enron had been very good to him and he had no intention of discussing this with anyone outside the immediate company.  As an FYI to you, I believe he mentioned that he still had this program on his home computer.
