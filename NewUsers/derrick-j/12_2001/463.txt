Bob, this is a duplicate of the message I forwarded to you last night. Jim

 


Dear Jim: I received a subpoena in TODAY's US Mail in Fred Greenberg v. various Enron Directors. I was directed to appear and bring various documents at the offices of Esquire Deposition Services, Houston, Texas on November 23, 2001.  It indicated that I was subpoenaed on a representative of ES Power 3 LLC. 
I officially retired from Enron on April 1, 2001. I have no understanding that I had any direct relationship with ES Power 3 LLC. I retained no records of the company and have no idea why I am being subpoenaed. 
Would you kindly advise me in a timely manner if I have any obligation to respond?  
The subpoena was mailed to me care of Enron in Houston and apparently forwarded to me in an envelope which arrived TODAY. 
Kindly advise me how I am expected to proceed.
