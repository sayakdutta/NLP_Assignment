Jim/Mark, attached is a memo that reflects my conversations with Jim Christie, Chairman of Blakes, regarding the ongoing management of Enron work, which I believe reflects our own internal discussions.  I am copying the lawyers in my group for their information.  Best regards, Peter.

 

Dear Peter:

Thank you for your note.  I enclose a clean copy of my memo as requested.

When I am next in Calgary, I would like to get together with you and, if he is available, Rob Milnthorp.  In the meantime, if there is anything I can assist with, please give me a call.

Best regards,





James R. Christie
