I hope you and Carrin enjoyed your weekend in London and had a good trip back to Houston.

A couple of things:

- I wondered if it was clear yet when General Counsel meetings would be held prior to the conference, and whether those would be in Houston or San Antonio?

- how did Marcus Zwinger impress you? I would like to make him an offer, if you are agreeable.

- we are seeing a sudden increase in metals related arbitration claims. We intend to use two firms to assist with these - both are established shipping / commodities law firms: Holman Fenwick is one, Richards Butler is the other. Please let me know if we have any issues with either of those firms.

Many thanks.



							Mark
