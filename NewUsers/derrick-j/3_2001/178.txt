Jim and Ben:

As directors of Atlantic Water Trust, Arthur Andersen will request you to sign the AWT management representation letter.   As you might be aware, this year Enron is required to file the AWT 12/31/00 audited financial statements as an attachment to the Enron 10-K, due to the significant write-down of Azurix.     The current deadline of the audit and sign-off on the final AWT financial statements is March 27th.   The deadline is primarily driven by Azurix and the completion of their 10-K.   Therefore I anticipate that the representation letter you will be ask to sign, will not be circulated until later this month.  In the meantime if you have any questions or concerns please call.

Regards,

Mike Morrison
