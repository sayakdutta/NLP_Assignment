alright what do you want for warrick dunn?

 

no 

 

ok alstott and troy brown for holt?

 

I would want an average wr and a solid back.  you wont be willing to give up either moss or owens, and your remaining backs are not steller(although alstott seems to be doing well.

 

not my fault - like i knew that jamal was going to blow out his knee - i didn't offer terrell davis.

what do you want for torry?

 

what about him?  you make me nervous, everyone you offer me for him gets hurt for the rest of the season.
