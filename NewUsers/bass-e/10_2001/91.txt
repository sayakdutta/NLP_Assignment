i just found that you could stay at highland lodge for 4 nights starting dec 13 and receive 4 lift tkts for that time period for $1600 total.  that is not bad ehh?




Hi Eric,
 
I know you must plan ahead for time off.  Perhaps this Dec. is not a good time for me to go.  I keep forgetting that it is sooner than I thought.  My foot will barely be healed by then so I doubt if I would ski.  I know, I don't ski that much anyway but I do like to venture out for 2 days.  I did find a good airfare from Continental, nonstop Houston to Denver at $262 if you and Shanna decide to go.   It requires travel on Tues. and/or Wed.  So, I was looking at Wed. to Tues.  A little longer than we normally stay.  Unfortunately, I saw no deals on the condos.  I really would like to do something for Dad's birthday - that's why I was thinking about Colo. because he loves it so much.  I am not totally ruling it out but I cannot commit at this time.  LU-M
