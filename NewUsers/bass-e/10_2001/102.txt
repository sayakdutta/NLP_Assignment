> With all of this talk of impending war, many of us
> will encounter "Peace Activists" who will try and
> convince us that we must refrain from retaliating
> against the ones who terrorized us all on September
> 11, 2001. These activists may be alone or in a
> gathering.....most of us don't know how to react to
> them. When you come upon one of these people, or one
> of their rallies, here are the proper rules of
> etiquette:
> 
> 1. Listen politely while this person explains their
> views. Strike up a conversation if necessary and
> look very interested in their ideas. They will tell
> you how revenge is immoral, and that by attacking
> the people who did this to us, we will only bring on
> more violence. They will probably use many
> arguments, ranging from political to religious to
> humanitarian.
> 
> 2. In the middle of their remarks, without any
&! gt; warning, punch them in the nose.
> 
> 3. When the person gets up off of the ground, they
> will be very angry and they may try to hit you, so
> be careful.
> 
> 4. Very quickly and calmly remind the person that
> violence only brings about more violence and remind
> them of their stand on this matter. Tell them if
> they are really committed to a non-violent approach
> to undeserved attacks, they will turn the other
> cheek and negotiate a solution. Tell them they must
> lead by example if they really believe what they are
> saying.
> 
> 5. Most of them will think for a moment and then
> agree that you are correct.
> 
> 6. As soon as they do that, hit them again. Only
> this time hit them much harder. Square in the nose.
> 
> 7. Repeat steps 2-5 until the desired results are
> obtained and the idiot realizes how stupid of an
> argument! he/she is making. 
> 
> 8. There is no difference in an individual attacking
> an unsuspecting victim or a group of terrorists
> attacking a nation of people. It is unacceptable and
> must be dealt with. Perhaps at a high cost. We owe
> our military a huge debt for what they are about to
> do for us and our children. We must support them and
> our leaders at times like these. We have no choice.
> We either strike back, VERY HARD, or we will keep
> getting hit in the nose
