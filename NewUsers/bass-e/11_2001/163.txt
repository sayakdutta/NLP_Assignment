where are you working now - i know you worked for that motorcycle company - do you still work there?  jason's fiancee (sorry no fancy accent) had been a friend of his for awhile. They started dating about a year and a hlaf ago and got engaged about 6-7 months ago.  She is very nice and we get along just fine.  
Thanksgiving was good - I stayed out at the the parents house for a couple of days and went up to college station on friday for the game.  How about you?
Glad to hear that Lucky is well.


 

no, i haven't left since then.  i just wasn't sure if you remembered the
last time we spoke.  i'm really enjoying my job.  i'm also glad to be back
in houston.  is jason's fianc?e someone he has known for a while?  do you
get along with her?  did you stay in houston for thanksgiving?  you never
asked anymore about lucky, but he is doing well. glad you are too.....
