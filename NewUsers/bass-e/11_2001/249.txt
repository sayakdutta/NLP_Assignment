Sounds good to me. Right now there could be no golf. I look(and feel) like
the Mayflower settler who lost the fight with the Indian but woke up in time
to save  a PART of his scalp.  However, if things progress okay should be
ready to play by next Wed. I assume the course is closed on Thanksgiving, so
lets plan on playing around noon or so on Wed. That okay with you? Love-Dad

I am off work starting next Tuesday, so I will probably come out to the
house Wednesday afternoon sometime.  Do I need to bring anything?

Dad, do you want to play golf, assuming you are up to it of course?

Love,
E
