then you are done

 

watching him squeal like a pig.

 

what is your commission?

 

you may need to hire me as a collection agent.  i think i have a steel pipe under my desk.

 

surprising . . .

 

that sounds good 9 it is.  we will go for beers regardless

 

Alright,  I'll take the bet.  I'll have to scrounge around to find 40 buck though!  You know you're stealing money from my severance!  I may need that to eat on by the end of the week.  If you say the line is 9, that works for me.  CU is on a role....it's time for Simms to go down!

If you steal my money, you'll have to buy me a beer.
 

Since you never gave me the $20 for the last time we bet on CU/Texas, I figured I would give you the chance to go double or nothing on the second round.  I think the line is Texas -9.  Let me know.
