Our records indicate that you will be up for rotation soon.  In order to 
secure your next rotation and to ensure a good fit, please choose one of the 
following options:

Please forward me an updated copy of your resume along with your business 
unit and function preferences.  Once we receive this, we will begin sending 
your resume out to those business units with open positions and the managers 
will then contact you directly if they are interested.
Please contact my assistant Jessie Patterson at x3-0927 to schedule a meeting 
with me.  We can discuss your business unit and function preferences at that 
time as well as any other concerns.
If you plan to extend your current rotation, please let me know the date the 
rotation will end.
If you have already started another rotation, please complete the following 
information and send back so that we may update the database.
