Mike,

When (if :-) ) you have a minute could you do me a favour and send me an excel dump of all the deal numbers of GTMA Physical forwards we are expecting to settle for march production (27th to 1 April), with their projected volumes, the contract price, and the value?  This will help me get an idea of whether we have any missing data.  

Thanks

James
