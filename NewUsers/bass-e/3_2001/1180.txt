Eric,

Please forward me your logon id, logon password, Lotus Notes password. I also 
need to know what operating system you are on (NT or Win2000). Also do you 
have a Palm Pilot or iPaq. One more thing, please save any files on your 
current C:/ drive to your network folder. Almost forgot what is a good time 
for me to come by and install. If you have any questions please call me. 

thanks,
