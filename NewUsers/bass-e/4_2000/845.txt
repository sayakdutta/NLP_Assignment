What I am really looking for is a way to save monthly production data by 
county for the entire state for all of the data.  Unfortunately, saving the 
data like you mentioned wouldn't save me that much time. 

Thanks for your help.

When you call up the production save the file as a txt file then open it in 
excel as a delimited file.
If you need any help please feel free to give me a call or email me your 
phone number and I will be happy to walk through the steps with you.

Thanks,

I was wondering if there was a downloadable format(excel format) to the
gas production data.  Could you advise as to how to receive this info
without having to type it out manually?


Thanks,
