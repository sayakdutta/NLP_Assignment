The new product will be a day product like our current Katy and HSC Pool 
products, so it will be a fixed price product for next day gas delivered at 
the Corpus location.


Call with questions.

Do you mean an Index where there the price is based on the Gas Daily average?


The tech guys are building the connectivity between the 'Delivers On' feild 
and the Long Description. I'll ask them for a timeline.

Dale,

The Texas Desk needs to get a new product created.  We already have a 
baseload Index Corpus product.  We need to create a DAY Corpus product with 
the same parameters as this baseload product.


Also, anything new on the 5 X 24?

Thanks,

Eric
