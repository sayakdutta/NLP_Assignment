I MAY GO TOMORROW, ARE YOU?  SUNDAY WILL BE WAY TOO BUSY!

  
        

  No problem.  I didn't go out last night - just had a quiet
evening.  I am
  having a great day - work wise.  Are you going to the shell
open?

  Hey, sorry I didn't get a chance to call you back.  we went
to lunch and
  didn't get back until after 2, and then I had class at 2:30.
How is your
  day?  Did you go out last night?
