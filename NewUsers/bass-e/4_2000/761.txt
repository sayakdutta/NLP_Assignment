i will go







Good afternoon sons. How  is the world treating you? Hope all is well. I
need information from each of you. The Bass family reunion is Friday night
and Saturday, in Fairfield, on May 5th and 6TH. Barbara and Neil Bass are
the hosts. They need a head count of those attending, ASAP. Before I let him
know, I need to know if  either of you will be joining me and your Mother.
Hope you will, but will understand if you do not. Let me know as soon as you
can. Love U-Dad
