that's fine, 3212.

yeah, it would probably be better to do it later in the day.
preferably after 11:00



hehe!  Thanks!  what time do you usually get here in the morning?  are your 
morning's hectic?

is a penny good enough? 

just kidding, i'll give $25



yeah, it does seem like the weeks get longer and longer...  
Everything's going well.  Same old stuff, you know?  Matt's been out of town 
a lot lately, so that's no fun.  Plus, he's unhappy w/a few things that are 
going on at work.  Plus, he's tired of traveling, so he's looking for a job 
here.  We'll see...

You owe me whatever you want to give.  $25 gets you a T-shirt, but whatever 
amount is fine.

Hey Allison,

Not much is going on over here, just gutting it out until the weekend.  It 
seems like the weeks get longer and longer, doesn't it?

How are things in your world?
You can come by whenever you want to get the check.  How much do I owe you 
again?

Eric



Hey Eric,

What's going on?  I haven't seen you in a while...

I was wondering, when can I come by to pick up your check for JDF?  I need an 
excuse to come visit anyway :) 

Allison
