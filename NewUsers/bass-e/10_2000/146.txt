Hey Commish,

It appears as though I did not receive points for the Miami Defense (18) or 
Lamar Smith (36) due possibly to the late ending of the Monday night game...  
With the points, I should have 132 and a victory over the Snake Pit... As it 
stands now, I have only 78 points, and a loss in the system... Is there 
anything we can do???
