Tell me if you are in on the draft at 10:30.  To draft you need to go to the 
website and click on draft - go to the draft room.

Just as clarification - we start 6 players and have weekly scoring in haed to 
head matchups.  You can chage your lineup before each day's worth of action.  
Your sixth man can be any position.  The draft order will be determind at 
10:30.

Since the NBA season begins tonight, we need to have the fantasy basketball 

rules, go to the link below and scroll down to the bottom of the page to the 
rules link.

The Academy will roll once again!

And by the way plove, it is last day for everyone.  You can take 1 minute out 
of every half hour today to make a pick.  Everyone else has agreed.  Besides 
it won't be as much fun without my whipping boy again.

I never heard anything back from Walker's Westies so The Rounders are taking 
his spot.
