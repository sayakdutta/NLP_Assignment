Basketball is back! We're writing to let you know that your
fantasy basketball league's web site has been upgraded and
is ready for the 2000-2001 season. And here's the best news:
Your league is now FREE!

Click on the link above to access all your league's data
from last season, including team rosters, owners and rules.
The only thing different this year is the price: FREE.
There will be no charges to you whatsoever to run your
league with CBS SportsLine. Just visit the site, and sign
in to access your league.

One great new feature will make it quicker and easier to
access your fantasy teams. SportsLine's fantasy home page:
http://sportsline.commissioner.com/ now offers one
centralized login screen for easy one-click access to all
of your Sportsline fantasy teams.

As a sports fan, you may be interested in our newest
fantasy football game: End Zone Attack. Visit:

Then select one player at each of three positions, and win
$1,000 if your players earn the high fantasy score for the
week.

Welcome back to CBS SportsLine.com Fantasy Basketball, and
have a great 2000-2001 season!
