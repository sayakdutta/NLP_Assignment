A salesman from New Jersey pulled off the highway to get gas in Tyler, TX
recently and wandered into town to soak up the local culture. He noticed a
'Nativity Scene' that showed great skill and talent had gone into creating
it. One small feature bothered him however. The 3 wisemen were wearing
firemens helmets. Totally unable to come up with a reason or explanation,
he left. However, when he stopped at the E-Z Mart to get gas, he ask the lady
behind the counter about the helmets. She exploded into a rage, yelling,
"You Yankees never do read the Bible!" He assured her that he did, but simply
couldn't recall anything about firemen in the Bible. She jerked her Bible
from behind the counter and ruffled thru some pages, and finally jabbed
her finger at a passage. Sticking it in his face she said See, it says right
here, "The three wise men came from afar."
