Hi Mom,

Ruth Chris would be nice.  I don't know anything anout Cafe Natalie.  Use 
your judgement.  

We are about to leave for SD.  So I will give you a call from there.  
Don't forget to cheer for the horns and . . .

Hook 'em!









Hi Eric,

I just got the only remaining reservations at RC's but they are at 5.  At
this point, I am sure that it will be next to impossible to get anything
else, anywhere else.  I have been trying to contact a new, local restaurant
near here but their line has been busy.  They do have a prix fixe menu
though, unlike RC's.  Let me know what you want to do.  LU-M  Have a great
trip and be careful.
