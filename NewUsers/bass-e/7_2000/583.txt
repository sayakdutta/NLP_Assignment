i finally got work to pay for my phone.  i have been doing pretty well, 
despite the vast amounts of money that i have lost at work.  performance 
reviews are going today and i am hoping for a promotion to associate, so keep 
your fingers crossed.

chatted. Hope all is well with you and S. Stay in touch. Love-Dad
