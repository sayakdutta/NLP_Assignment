Unfortunately the Dream Matchup has been nixed by the Cotton Bowl.  UT is no 
longer in consideration for a Cotton Bowl berth.  It would have been fun to 
see how you fare against a top 5 team.

Maybe we will see you next year.  Of course, you will have to make it to the 
Rose Bowl.

Good luck in Dallas!
