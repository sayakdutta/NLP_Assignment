we will have a list of patterns just in case people don't know what they are, 
but the plays are designed to clear out areas so that certain patterns are 
more open.
you can draw plays in excel using the drawing toolbar.

what time are we going to scrimmage tomorrow?

suggestion... make a playbook that just shows individual routes.. that way 
Luis can just customize  in the huddle....

Ex.   outs, curls, out-and-up, post..  etc...     


also,,    You give routes to the linemen and they should block  and then roll 
out into the open flats once the defense goes past.... 

AND... most importantly.. how did you  draw those plays  excel....
