Please remind your guys to report Gas Daily positions for Dec. and Jan 
between now and the end of the month.  In some cases January gas daily 
positions may not be coming in automatically and will have to be plugged.  
This a result of computer logic problem and not an ERMS/TAGG problem.  Also,  
there should no January basis positions starting tomorrow.
