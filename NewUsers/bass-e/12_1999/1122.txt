I apologize for the short notice.  I am cancelling today's meeting due to the 
need to analyze the OA's and the matrix.  Please let me know if you guys will 
be available next Wednesday for a meeting(lunch will be provided).  I should 
have the info sooner than that, I would just like to keep on our normal day.  
Due to the holidays, some people may be out.  Let me know if you are able to 
attend that day so that I can order enough lunch.  Thanks.  Sorry again for 
the short notice.
PL
