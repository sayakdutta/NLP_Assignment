I just received a directive to obtain a list of the name of each file that is 
saved to a disk.  For example:

H / Gas Risk / Firm Trading / Spreadsheet / Y2K
H / Gas Risk / Firm Trading / West / Gas Daily Deals
H / Gas Risk / Firm Trading / East / Basis Curves

etc .....

Please provide this list to us when you come to 3084 to save your files.

Thanks!

WK
