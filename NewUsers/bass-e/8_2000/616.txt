plove, 
you might  as well cut your losses.  you are not going to get over on someone 
as badly as matt got over on you.  so you might as well bite the bullet and 
make a trade that actually is good for your team

give me a break...when you come up with a deal that is worthy of the person 
you are trying to select(ricky williams), come back and talk to me.
