I just got informed that for our PRC (TAX)- we don't even get to know our 
rating.  All we get to see is the "comments" section.  So- in other words- we 
will have no idea how we compare relevant to out peers.  I mean- this whole 
thing is getting a little ridiculous.

I still haven't heard back from Jennifer if we are still going to meet today 
about mine.
