jj johnson has shown nothing in preseason where as lamar has been excellent , 
they were already talking about lamar being the starte before johnson got 
suspended.

if you don't like that is fine but it still doesn't change the fact that you 
have a shaky second rb and no backups that start let alone play.

so let me know

Yeah, Lamar is solid for 4 weeks until JJ Johnson comes back.  Not interested.
