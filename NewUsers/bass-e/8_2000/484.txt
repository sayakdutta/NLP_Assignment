since my team sucks so bad, i want to bet you $1000 that i have a better 
record than you this year



Not really, since I had the chance to draft Stephen Davis and passed... While 
I also asked to trade down 2 slots to get Stephen Davis, I am now very 
pleased with the Kult, negotiations with the draftees seems to be going well 
and we should have most with the exception of Bledsoe and Terrell in camp by 
weeks end...

so you are basically saying that you wouldn't take stephen davis for gonzo



No sir...

i repeat, uou have no offer?



He was my number 2 pick, and I don't want to hear about me drafting him too 
early, else we would not be having this correspondence...

so, there is nothing on my team that you are willing to give up gonzo for, i 
find that hard to believe



I took a peek at your squad and no go... Thrill kill will rule this bitch...

i will give you walls and terrence wilkins



Your top wide receiver and tight end, and I might throw in my fourth 
receiver...
