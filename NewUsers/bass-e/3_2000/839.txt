We are currently attempting to schedule the Texas Gas Trading Employee 
Appreciation Night at Sam Houston Race Park.
The proposed date is Thursday, March 23, 2000 and the festivities will begin 
at 6:00p.m.  It is important that you contact me ASAP with your 
availability.  I would like to report a definite headcount to Tom by this 
afternoon.

Note:  Gas Control, Risk Analysis, Management Team, Transport Rate Group and 
Logistics will also celebrate with us.  


Many thanks,
Barbara Lewis
