no bitch - you don't keep in touch with me either.  I actually have been 
pretty busy with the new job.  I have a friend in IT here who said that they 
are looking for 200 people to fill slots.   It's a hot job market over here.

How's compaq doing?










I guess you are just too busy to keep in touch with your older brother.  Was
it something I said?
