I have been to see brooks & dunn, jo dee messina, and ahem rod stewart.  i am 
going to steve miller and kenny rogers.  

i am actually too cool to hang out with brian now - just don't tell him i 
said that.   i don't know about earth day yet but i suspect that i will go 
b/c goo goo dolls are playing.







Things here are good as well.  I think I have been to about five rodeos as
well, which ones have you gone to?  The fam is doing well, and yours?  I saw
brian last week and then again on Sunday.  I guess you are too cool to hang
out with him, huh?  Congrats on the new position, so will you pay for me to
go to law school now that you are a millionaire?  Are you going to earth day
this year?  What about buzz fest?  Why are you too cool to write me or call
me?
