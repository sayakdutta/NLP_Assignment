we won both games, of course.  i was 3-6 with a double off the fence - and 
you missed it!  One guy on our team hit a home run in back-back at bats.

Good morning!!  How was your little games?  Did ya'll win?  Any homeruns 
hit?  I was in bed for 9:45 last night- and I am still tired this morning- 
what is wrong with me?  Anyhow- hope you have a good day- call me later when 
you get a chance.

Shanna
