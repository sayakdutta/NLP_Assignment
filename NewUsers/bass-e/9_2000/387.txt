I just now saw it.  It looks like a great gift (more from a daughter than a 
son).  I will look at it when it comes.

Ok- since you finally asked-

It is this book entitled "The Story of a Lifetime- A Keepsake of Personal 
Memoirs".  

Here is the description that was given:

"Give this book to someone whose story you want to know . . . It invites the 
reader to share memories, facts, philosophies, beliefs, knowledge, and wisdom 
gained from a lifetime of experience.  Hundreds of questions encourage 
thoughtful reponses.  When complete, it's a priceless heirloom for future 
generations."

I thought it was a neat gift idea- so that your mom can share her thoughts 
with you, and you (your children, your children's children) would have them 
when (unfortunately) she is not around anymore.

I ordered one for my mom also.

Hopefully it will be as neat as it sounds.

I don't know, babe.  What did you get?

I ordered your mom a present yesterday.  It should get here before her 
birthday- I would think- because they said it was in stock.  Anyway- I didn't 
know if you had her anything yet or not- but your welcome to give it to her 
if you want-  I just read about it- and thought it would be something that 
she would enjoy- and that you might enjoy giving to her.   But- like I said- 
I ordered it on-line- so I haven't been able to examine it in person- but 
sounded really neat.
