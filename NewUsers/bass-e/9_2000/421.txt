freeman and garner and mcnabb for taylor and george







Eric,

I will tell you that it will have to be an offer that I can't refuse.  You
are actually going to maybe take the short end of the stick.  I have done
without him for 4 weeks and he is back this coming week and I am looking
forward to having him in the lineup.
