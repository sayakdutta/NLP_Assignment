alright, when you find out that mine is the best bid for an injury prone 
player that has been unable to complete an entire season in his career, you 
can come back to me and maybe toomer and garner (the third highest scoring 
back in the league) will still be there.







No thanks.  I will shop.

toomer for taylor

him?
