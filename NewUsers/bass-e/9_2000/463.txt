you have to like garcia against carolina over brunell against balt or bledsoe 
against njy ...  don't you?



Na man, I'm thinking of starting Brunell this week, although I don't know how 
he will fare against a tough Baltimore defense... Bledsoe is going against 
the Jets in Tuna bowl XXX...

How about Garcia and Bettis for Brunell?



I like Bledsoe since I have T. Glenn now, but I could also keep Brunell if 
McCardell is available... Quadry and/or Garner...

Brunell or Bledsoe - which one are you willing to trade and for what?  I 
could give a rb and a WR
