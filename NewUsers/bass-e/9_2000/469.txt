i reserved an extra room - but we can cancel at any time before 6 tomorrow

let em know about val



Who's driving and how many cars are we taking?



if shirley hasn't left town yet i think i can get him a ticket.  let him come 
even if nobody back out anyway.  it doesn't matter squeezing 1 more person 
into the room.
