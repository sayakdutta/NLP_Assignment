> Dear Candy,
> I miss you so much. It's terrible that you can only visit twice a year.
> Please don't worry about me, though. It's boring here, but not too bad.
> The golf, tennis and fishing seem to make the days pass fairly quickly.
> My cell isn't quite as large as I hoped for... one bath and a small
balcony.
> I'm sending a picture with the guards. They are very kind and
> under-standing.
> Love,
>
