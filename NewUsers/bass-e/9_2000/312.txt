I don't know what he is going to do.  I hope that they start Simms, not 
because Applewhite is bad but because Simms needs some time to develop.  
Although, I think that Mack is going to stay with his 2 QB system because of 
pride.

I was sweating in the 3rd qtr. when we were down 17-14.  What do you think 
they'll do about the QB situation?

I do have to say, our QB question has definitely been answered.  I just hope 
our defense can hold up.  The Tech and Colorado games should be good guides.

once we settle on a qb

The question is:  could you guys take San Jose State?  What happened to the 
running game?
