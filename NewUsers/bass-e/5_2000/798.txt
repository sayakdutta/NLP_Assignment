Facility fees should be part of the accrual value that fall's out each month 
( as long as the deals are in the WH portfolio).  This value should not be 
given to Sharp unless he bears the cost of the facilities.  There is a file 
in my folder that has a listing of some of the deals that have facility 
fees.  For further info contact Vance Taylor. (the file is called fac costs)

In addition,  I am forwarding an e-mail sent by George Weissman to me 
regarding accrual value.  He thinks that the Coastal Deal that shows up as a 
huge negative each month should have been restructured in April.  Could you 
check into this and get back to him?

Thanks,

Eric

Are the facility fees part of the accrual piece we are holding out for Greg 
Sharp?  If not, how can we find the deals we have held out value to cover 
these fees?
