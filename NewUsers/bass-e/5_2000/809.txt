We will trade this product every day, but we aim to start trading it this bid 
week, if possible.

Michael - can you give me an idea of where we are in uploading the Specs for 
this.

Eric, our biggest concern with this right now is the valuation for the 
Products that you would see in your Position Summary. We know that is we 
passed these trades through the system as a straight month-long transaction, 
that the valuation would be wrong. Additionally, the start and end dates will 
skue the valuation based on which day of the week the first calendar day of 
the month falls on and which day of the week the last calendar day of the 
month falls on. Using a straight 5/7 valuation methodology is only going to 
get you 'close' to true value in the Position Summary. Hence, the specs sent 
to Mike that you see in the e-mail below will need to be built.

In short, Eol was not set up to readily accept this valuation methodology. We 
will get you as close as we can, and we will give you some idea of how close 
these Position Values will be. 

Also, can you confirm that you intent to always and ONLY trade this Product 
during bid week?

Michael, 

I owe you a spec. re. this and here it is:

The volume for products that have delivery frequency of:

Daily
Hourly
Half Hourly

need to be modified by the multiplier week coverage factor. 

This is found on table EOL_WEEKDAY_GROUPINGS, and the link is

EOL_MARKET_PRODUCTS.DELIVERY_WEEKDAY_GROUP_ID = 
EOL_WEEKDAY_GROUPINGS.WEEKDAY_GROUP_ID.

Mark & Michael,
Remember we had discussed this when you were here.
The question is ......................in EOL Reports there is a Position 
Summary Report and in Stack Manager there is the Transaction Summary.
will these calculate properly on the 24x5 product? The start date & end date 
will imply every day but the product excludes weekends.

We have finsihed creating and testing a the new 24x5 Nat Gas Product (a month 
long transaction which only moves gas Mon-Fri). A final question has come up 
- how will these be calculated. Jennifer is under the impression that 
something was being built in the EOL Position Summary Report that would be 
able to calculate these kinds of trades. Is that the case? Has that been done?
