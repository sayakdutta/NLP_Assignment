Dale,

On the new Gas Daily product that you are setting up, I think it would be a 
good idea to have a Nymex reference in the short description.  Something 
like, US Gas Daily NX GD/D HSC. 


In addtion, we need two new index locations set up, Carthage hub and Agua 
Dulce hub.  Please contact Todd Richardson for further details on these.

Thanks for your help.
