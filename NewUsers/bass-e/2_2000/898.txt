Eric;

Two requests for the current Central Power & Light contract 96022030 - Sitara 
Deal 92399:

1.  For January 2000 volumes, we need a deficiency charge added in the amount 
of 12,231.85.

2.  For the entire length / term of this deal, the second step of the tiers 
or NNQ should have the rate handle associated with Gas Daily Houston Ship 
Channel HIGH for the day delivered less one cent.   This is per the 
confirmation Contract Price item 2.  The dollar impact for the incorrect use 
of the MID rate for Jan '00 is 6,395.23.  This same change in the rate handle 
should be made retroactively to November '99 and proactively through October 
'00.

Total dollar impact for January '00 = 18,627.08  added revenue.

Attached is the Jan worksheet.  Questions or comments, please let me know.
