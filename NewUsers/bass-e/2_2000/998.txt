The official social co-ordinator, Lisa,  will be unable to perform her 
obligations this evening as she is leaving on a jet plane.  As a result, I am 
taking it upon myself to conduct a poll regarding tonight's activities or 
lack thereof.  Please voice your opinions to all whether or not tonight 
should involve some sort of group outing.
