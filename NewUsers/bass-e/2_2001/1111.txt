hey mom,

we drove by some houses in the potomac area - the problem is that all of the 
newer houses are in the $600K+ range.  the older houses are not much to look 
at from the outside but iw ould like to see some.
i have cash for dad but if you don't need it that is fine.  my bill thus far 
is $500 but i can pick it up this weekend.

i had no idea about the date change - when is it?

Love,
e









Hi Eric,
?
Did you see any houses yesterday??  
?
Did you get cash for Dad?? We forgot to  ask.? Don't worry about it.? I got 
my limit increased at the grocery  store so it won't be a problem anymore.? I 
do owe you a check.? What  is your address so I can mail it to you?? Or, do 
you want to pick it up  this weekend?? How much do I owe you, $400 or $500?
?
Did you have a good time with D and Jason  Friday?? I hear they have changed 
the wedding date.? Did they say  anything to you?
?
Have a great day.?  LU-M
