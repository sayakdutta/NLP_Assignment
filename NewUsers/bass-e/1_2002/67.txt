Congrats on the engagement. Sounds like a great evening.  I hope your holidays went well otherwise.  Sorry I didn't get to see ya.  Next time perhaps.

-Eric

PS I hope you caught the Holiday Bowl - the best game I have seen in awhile.












Hey there y'all.  Hope you had a Merry X-mas and a good New Year's Eve.
I just got back from Texas where I asked Marilyn to marry me (she said yes 
you wacko so don't even ask).  I updated the website with pics and a story 
on how it went down.

Brett.
