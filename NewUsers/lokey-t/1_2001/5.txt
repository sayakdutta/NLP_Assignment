If it would work better for you all, we could get together for lunch/dinner and a tattoo on Saturday, or the weekend after the race.  Let me know.

Sure, if you and laura can leave by about 11:15  we can be back before 1:00.  Let me know if that works for both of you.

I'm starting to have the weirdest schedule.  I have a meeting from 9:00 to 11:00, and one at 1:00.  Is that enough time to have lunch today?
