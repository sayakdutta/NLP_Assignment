At a meeting held 2-3 weeks ago, it was decided that the P&C Agreements modified the terms of the base contracts and that separate rate amendments were not required.  I believe this was the consensus of the attendees in both Omaha and Houston.  Steve, Greg and others attended via videoconference in Omaha.

 

What is the status of getting the rate amendments executed?  if they haven't been done why don't we include both in with these?  MK

 



 

I believe these are all Negotiated Rate Agreements...

Oneok #27607 needs the receipt to be amended from East of Thoreau to Westar Ward, PPL#27649 needs to be amended from East of Thoreau to West Texas pool, and PPL#27641 needs to also be amended from East of Thoreau to West Texas pool for 4265/d...the balance of 15735/d will remain at East of Thoreau.  Can we get these contracts amended by this Friday?  Thanks.
