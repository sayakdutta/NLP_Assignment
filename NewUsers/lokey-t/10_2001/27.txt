Oneok #27607 needs the receipt to be amended from East of Thoreau to Westar Ward, PPL#27649 needs to be amended from East of Thoreau to West Texas pool, and PPL#27641 needs to also be amended from East of Thoreau to West Texas pool for 4265/d...the balance of 15735/d will remain at East of Thoreau.  Can we get these contracts amended by this Friday?  Thanks.
