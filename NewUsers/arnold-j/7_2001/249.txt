i took a week and a half off during the same time that Bo Collins of EL Paso left so naturally I am going to El paso.  I'm not going anywhere unfortunately.  I'm in for July 31 if you've got them

 

It would mean divorce court.  I went last night.  But I have got them for 31 July, if we you would like to schedule in advance.  Thanks for the invite but I will have to pass on this one.  By the way, there are all sorts of rumors about you and where you will be working.

regards,

Paul






any chance you can go to the game tonight?  i've got the good ones..
