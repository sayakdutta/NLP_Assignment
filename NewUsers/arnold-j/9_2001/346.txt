i just mean to flip/flop the traders and orig so they are still sitting together but the trading is next to financial and texas rather than the orig




I understand your concern.  However I don't want to separate origination and trading.  Most of our originators work the daily market and need to be close to the traders.


Importance: High


any thought to flipping your traders and orig to get all the trading as close to possible?

Attached is the most recent version of the ECS 6th floor layout.  Each team has been assigned a predetermined number of desks.  John has asked that you place your people only in the desks allotted to you.  Assistants should be colored in white where applicable.  Some teams are still in the same area and changes may not be necessary.  

If all of your commercial organization does not fit, please send me back a list of those people who will need to be assigned a desk on the fifth floor. 

John would like to have a final revision of this by end of day tomorrow (Thursday). 

Thanks in advance for your prompt attention,
