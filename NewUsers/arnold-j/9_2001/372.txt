if cash/futures is 10-15 then oct will have a very weak settle.

they are trying to use the regular access system on the internet which was supposed to come out two weeks ago but they delayed because the firewalls and security issues hadnt been solved

 

okay i guess i misunderstood the press release or the bubbleheads on cnbc--so they will be using the regular access electronic system for the 2 shortened sessions..and what do you think about 1-current cash to futs 20ng price in general--thanks

the nymex is so technologically incompetent that they have no idea.   after working on it for 18 months they're trying to buy are technology now

 

oops enymex

 


huh?
 

how does nymex work?

 

all I hear is that all the funds are going to get squeezed as soon as the nymex opens.  fuck, i don't know, but I'm not going get long crude hoping to squeeze the funds.  lost that game too many times.

 

nice move--stats will be very very bullish---especially padd I and II--expect big draws.
