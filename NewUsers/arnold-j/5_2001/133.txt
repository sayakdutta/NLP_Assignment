i think i've got yahoo somewhere on my computer.  i'll try to find it.  expecting 110 today.  still think we're not at fundamental equilibrium but scared that, as much as i hate technicals, the wave 3 is over and we can do some serious chop here.  if we didnt have expiry in 4 days i'd be worried about a short covering rally.  however, i think the market is going to have a hard time placing the baseload gas this month.  the storage guys are all above their targets right now and expect them to back off relative to last month.

 

no yahoo and bloomberg professional. the entire oil industry on yahoo. ill
have a hell of a time getting on another syetm due firewall issues etc.you
know coprorate america as you pted out. im getting a few natgas guys and
brokers on yahoo as well. steve_lafontaine if you can get it loaded. get a
bloomberg terminal-can share news stories etc-excellant fundamental dat base
as well. worth the price and alot of managed money uses as well.




are you on msn messenger.  i think i'm set up with it.
