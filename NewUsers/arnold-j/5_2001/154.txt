	i think i had better weather in massachusetts than you had in mexico.  very relaxing though.  if i lived in the northeast and had 2.1 kids and 1.3 dogs i would definitely get a summer house around there
 

was until this morning.  it rained the whole time - no tan - just extra lbs from drinking beer.  how was your trip?

 

relaxed?   how was it?
