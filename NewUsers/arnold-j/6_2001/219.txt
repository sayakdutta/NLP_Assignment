Kevin,
I'm following up with you on e-mail  below I sent you, Craig Breslau,Wade  Hicks,Kevin Presto,Joe Gold,Don Schroeder,Phil Clifford, and  Alan Engbergto determine  who amongst you would be best  suited for a discussion on below topic.
We are actively engaged with VP-leveland Director-levelexecutives of Energy and Commodities Trading at companies such as DukeEnergy, ReliantEnergy, Williams Energy,  Entergy/Koch, Cargill,  and others.
Our team is in Houston 3 days a week. We could either  arrange a face-2-face or a conference call to  discuss?
I  look forward to your reply.
Thanks,

ReliantEnergy, DukeEnergy, Entergy-Kochand many othertrading  firms claim to miss outon 75-80% of the arbitrage trading opportunities. We're areextensivelyworking with them tohelp spot those  lucrative spreads.
