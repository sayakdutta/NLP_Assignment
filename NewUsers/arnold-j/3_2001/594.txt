so argument more switching than outright lost demand?    where are petro 
prices on a comparable equivalence?








enjoy cabo-im not really surpised at lack of dmand recovery-will be slow to
recover esp with failing econ growth. the one thing concerns me about bear 
side
is implied demand for us petro products is huge. doesnt seem to suggest an
econmic impact on that side. having said that absulte px for petro much much
lower relative to natgas
