i think there are so many shorts that some of the weak guys are squeezable here.  not all and not massive short covering.  just think the boys will be buying in front of next week's number.  best trade is to be long now and sell right before number

 

johnny johhny johnny-- there is no secrecy when one is the king of ng .. your brokers have the biggest moves in the world. clealry you scare the hell outof them next week is we get a real low ga--perhaps surprise attack bid itup after a 110 aga--now tha would be amusing.

anyway--our friends the funds--seem a tad weird of late- a$3.00 move up in WTI and next to no short covering.

do really think it would only 20cts in ng to squeeze em? what is the pain threshold

 

exaggerations...word travels everywhere doesnt it?  how'd you hear?

me thinks everybody short and everybody wants the market to go down.  I'm relatively flat and would love to squeeze all the fuckers out so I can sell them 20 cents higher.

 

true?
and when do you plan on selling them
