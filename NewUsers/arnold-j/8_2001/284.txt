1. i would guess notional value $2-3 bil per day including financial derivatives.
2. probably doubled market share in gas since eol
3. probably 25% of our trades are intl

 

we have the eol case today in Entrepreneurial Manager.
question:
what is the daily value of transactions done on eol?
how has eol increased market share in gas?
how has eol done internationally?

thanks,
ep
