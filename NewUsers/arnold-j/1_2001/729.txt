thank you four you're note.  i am only twelv years old so i wont bid anymore. 
i am sorry.







Since you are my high bidder on the girlie magazines, it is of utmost
importance that you be of 21 years of age or older due to graphic material.
If scantily clad gals offend you or you are of a religious nature, please do
not bid further.  On the other hand, if you like it, bid on!  Thank you.
