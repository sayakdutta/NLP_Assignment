year.  Had a great time in new orleans but it was freezing.  nice to get 
away.  going to vegas this weekend to watch the football games.

Well, never got to NY to enjoy New Years and the blizzard.? However, by 
staying in Dallas, did experience a white New Year's eve.? Never made it to 
Addison Cafe for New Year's eve dinner (back up plans), roads were just too 
bad.? But I cooked fresh salmon at home and we had a very lovely dinner. 

Hope you had a wonderful celebration (not quite the same as last year in 
Sidney, now was it) and brought in the new year with a bang!

Have a happy, healthy and much more prosperous 2001!? I wish only the best 
for you.? Love you much, your Mom
