sure, how about thursday at 3:30?   would like to get update on ENE's lng 
projects as well. 





John, I have just arrived in Houston, and will be running the LNG Trading & 
Shipping business. I worked for Louise for many years, and took over the 
European Gas business from her when she came over here a few years ago. I'd 
like to meet you and discuss a few issues. Do you have any time over the next 
few days? 

Thanks,
Jonathan
