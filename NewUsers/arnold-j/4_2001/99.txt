John,
We are trying to transfer your bloomberg account and need to know who within Enron North America can sign-off on this
contract.  Would that be you?  Or do you have a legal department that we should forward it to?  We initially changed the 
name on it and had it signed under Enron Corp which is where the majority of our Bloomberg contracts lie, but because
you can actually execute trades from the system that you are now using, it has to be under your departments name
and we need someone to sign the contract.

Let me know.

Thanks,
Julie

 

Hi Julie. I noticed the contracts have been received.  However, "North America"
has been crossed off the contract. That is the name it was signed under and
still the current trading name for Emissions and Natural gas. Not sure if it
was a mistake or not. Anyway - please get back to me when you can. I am going
to try to set up a meeting with the gas guys for tomorrow 4/17. Thanks
