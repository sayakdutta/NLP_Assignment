Request


	

You will be receiving (if you haven't already) an e-mail from "Dennis" 

an attached form.  His request states "Immediate Action Required".

It has come to our attention that you may not be familiar with FSD which is 
the data service processing partner to Keilty Goldsmith.  They
are responsible for sending out the Team Selection Forms to all of our 
participants.  I wanted to reconfirm that Dennis' e-mail attachment is your 
Team Selection Form which must be completed and forwarded back to FSD for 
processing by 12:00 noon, Thursday, August 31st.  

To Assitant of Participant.  If your manager is out of town, please let me 
know and I will get a form to you so that you can
hopefully fax it to his/her destination.  I will work with you in any way 
possible to adhere to the timeline.  Thanks!  

Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate in contacting me.
