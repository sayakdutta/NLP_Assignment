"You can't turn away for a minute or you get picked  off." Damn!! I'm
minding my own business sitting on the dooker  reading Time, and sure
enough i get picked off! Sheeeeeeeeeet.   Friggin celebrities. Can I have
your autograph? :)

Nice work, dood.

Fellas, I believe the new job is almost here--i was  told yesterday that I
got the job and am just waiting for the phone offer  (supposed to happen
this afternoon). If it comes through, I'll be covering  the
internet--should be pretty solid. Who knows, if EnronOnline gets spun  off
(obv, not gonna happen) I might even get to cover it... what a  mock!
Anyway, thought I'd drop you two a line. Hope things are going  well...

can't wait for football... lemme know when  you boys come back out here...
