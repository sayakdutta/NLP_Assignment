i was just thinking i should invite you to come over tonight.  wanna come?

 

I just know you could use a vacation.  Is there any chance I could talk you
into going to Miami the weekend after Thanksgiving?  It's guaranteed to be a
good time.

I plan to be home tonight, and it would be NICE to hear from you.
