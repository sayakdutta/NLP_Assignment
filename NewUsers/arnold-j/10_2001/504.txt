maybe,  some specialization is beneficial though.  

 

porsche boxster (maybe the bmw one) instead or 5000 they raffle a car...hahahaha johnny..only exempt group is egm crude and products which keeps hiring and hiring

also dont you think it was about time there was one fundamentals group where all information was shared and disseminated to trading

 

they're giving away a porsche boxster or a cardboard boxcutter?

 

that means nothing..uk is giving away boxter for new employees ans slicing 10% at same time

 

no way.  we're still paying $5000 for new employee referrals

 

YA HEARING ANYTHING ON THIS
