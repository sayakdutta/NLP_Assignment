i think cash gets much stronger over the coming weeks relative to nov.  first inclination when cash comes up is that futures go up.  however, there is an 80 cent spread between cash and december.  cash can easily go up without dec moving.  

 

are u saying cash comes up to meet futs..so where do see nov01 dec 01 jan 02 rolling off

 

outright long....a long time from now.    
looks like with cold weather curve is going to reshape.  front up, back nothing
