I went to the Front Porch after the crappy game and then went back to my front porch with billy white.  he wouldnt leave.  stayed until 1:15.  get the feeling he doesnt get out much.

 

I thought there was something different about you - I don't think the extra hour helped me much.  And I don't see how you stay out late and get so much work done.  I am having trouble making it through this day!  Unless I start taking sleep aids, I will be a big mess by Friday!

 

no.  Have had 2 late nights in a row and it doesnt get much better rest of the week.  had to get  an extra hour of beauty sleep.  can you tell?

 

Did you go this morning?  I need drugs to sleep at night.  

 

ended up getting in late last night.  monday night football turned into tuesday morning football.

 

went this morning - did you go?


 

got your running shoes on?
