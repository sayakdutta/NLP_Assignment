Fangming,

I am out of town until tomorrow so will not be able to see the demo today.  
Wednesday afternoon looks good for me if you'd like to do it then.  John, 
does this work for you?

Brian

Hi, Brian:
Let me know if you have time for the messageboard application demo today. I
am planning to take vacation on Friday and coming Monday. I will not be
available to show you the demo until next Wednesday if you can't see it
today.

Let me know your schedule.

Thanks,

Fangming
