Ina,

We're setting up a secure message board for all the traders on the floor.  
Can you please provide Fangming with our current list of gas traders?  

Thanks,
Brian

Brian, 
Please provide the list of user's NT loginID and their full name  whoever 
will use this application. I am going to set up the security for them while I 
am buiding the application. 
Thanks,
Fangming

Looks good.  That's exactly what we're looking for.  John, please comment if 
there are any additional features you'd like to add.

Brian
