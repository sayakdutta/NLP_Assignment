I've got a "strategy" mtg from 3:00 - 5:00.  It's very important.  I've got 
to strategize about things.  Not sure about exactly what.  Just things.



Other than the fact that we desparately need your unbelieveably 
marketing-savvy person up here - no. What's going on in the trading world?  
Maybe I'll have to mosey on down there later today.  Is it busy?
