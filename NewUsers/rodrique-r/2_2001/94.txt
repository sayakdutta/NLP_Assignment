Now that that lady is irritating you maybe you'll finally miss me.  Well, I 
might finally be getting somewhere on my move.   I now have an informal offer 
that is acceptable.  I just need it in writing now.  But it looks like I'll 
be in Chicago by March 12th.  Yikes...I have a lot to do before then.  We 
need to all go to lunch before I leave.  

Good luck ignoring your neighbor.  RR

Need something to do?  The lady that sits in your old spot is helping her 
brother with his divorce.  In fact he may not have to anything but show up in 
court!  The details I don't care to hear, but I can't help it.  I can hear 
everything and every day there is some new personal matter that needs to be 
taken care of.  Maybe if she stuck to just her own business she wouldn't be 
on the phone so much and I wouldn't have to hear all the junk.  Gag.  B.
