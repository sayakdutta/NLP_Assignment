Hey girl,

I'm really in about the same position I was in on Monday.  I've talked to the 
people in the office and they promise me they are still interested in having 
me up there.  But HR seems to be impeding the process at this point.  I'm 
just waiting for them to get back to me.  And the VP's son had surgery this 
week and apparently it was much more serious than they expected, so she's 
been unavailable all week.  She's supposed to be back in the office on Monday 
so hopefully she'll shake things up a little.  I definitely won't leave 
without saying goodbye.  We'll have to get together for lunch once I have 
some definite plans.  

Talk to ya later...Enjoy your day off.

Hey Robin- 

        I was just wondering how the plans were coming along for Chicago.  
Don't run out of here without saying bye to me, OK!   What date are you 
planning on starting up there? 

Talk to ya later.  (but not Monday at Spanish class because I am taking the 
day off)
Alicia
