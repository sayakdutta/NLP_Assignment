I've decided that I'm going to quit worrying about them.  I finally heard 
from the VP yesterday.  Her son has been in the hospital, so she's been out 
of the office ever since I went up there.  So basically we've made no 
progress.  She's back now, though, so I'm hoping I'll know something soon.  
If I do end up going which is very likely I'm going to leave pretty soon.  
That's  the main reason I'm going home this weekend.  I'll let you know when 
I hear something.

Hey Bags,

It's good to hear from you.  I wish I could make it, but I'm going home for 
the weekend.  Hope you guys have fun.  

Bye,
Robin
