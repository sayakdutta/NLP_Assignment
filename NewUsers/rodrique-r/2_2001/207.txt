Kathy,

I have attached  a copy of the P&L that was reported as of January 31 for 
Canada.  You will notice that Disturnal's P&L is no longer reported as part 
of Canada, however I have included his p&l  for tieout purposes.  If you have 
any questions please let me know.

Robin

This is what I have for Canada's p&l for January 2001.  Can you let me know 
what you reported so that we can make sure that it is the same?  

Kathy
