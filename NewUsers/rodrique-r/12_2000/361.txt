I didn't make it to the final test.  I didn't get out of here until after 
11:30.   So I only wasted two hours of my life this afternoon.  I still have 
one section left.  If I can get out of here at a decent time I'll finish it 
tonight.  Otherwise I'll finish it tomorrow at lunch.  I have to finish it by 
tomorrow or I'll have to pay another $40!  So it's not safe to ride with me 
yet.  Not that my car ever really leaves the Enron garage!  

I'm glad you'll be getting out of here early.
