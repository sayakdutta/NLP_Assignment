GOING????!!!  How about completely gone!  I've only been here an hour and a 
half and already we've had two major crisises!  Doesn't that sound like fun?  
Have you thought of a gift I could give to my friends in Australia yet?  You 
really need to get on that.  I'm going shopping this weekend.  I have to buy 
a mother's day gift for my mom (I know a little late, but I haven't seen her 
yet) and a birthday gift for my younger brother (can't call him little 
anymore, he's as big as me) and I think I'm going to go ahead and get a 
father's day gift for my dad.  

Well, have fun.  Talk to ya later.

I hate to complain but the lunch was greasy and the garlic in the fettuccini 
was crunchy and there was a ton of it.  Can you smell the garlic from there?  
At least the cheese cake was good.
I'm going crazy.
