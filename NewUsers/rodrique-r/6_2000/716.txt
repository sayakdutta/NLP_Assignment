It's b/c you don't have me there to control things!!  Just kidding.  Sounds 
like you as busy as we are.   So quit reading your email and get to work!!

Mary Lynne was calling Stacey B. from Carla's desk (I don't know why) but he 
chose not to answer.  She's standing there going "he's at his desk, pick up" 
which was aggravating to her.  Oh well.
Eric is putting his storage entries in today.  Shannon has to manually key 
them in the matrix.  She's not happy.  I wouldn't be either.
Tony has put in a million entries and so have I.
It is still a zoo here.  What's up with all this chaos?  It's more than 
usual.  B
PS The candy idea is the best.  A nice sample of chocolates and sugar.
