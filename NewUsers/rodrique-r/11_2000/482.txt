I couldn't send myself a net send.  Guess I'll just have to talk to myself 
the old fashioned way.

Thank you, it worked
 MS DOS definitely does not work for me anymore. It is weird because it works 
when I send myself a message. Try sending yourself a message to see what 
happens. Let me know. 

Have you kept up with any new information about Risk people? You know what I 
mean right ?
