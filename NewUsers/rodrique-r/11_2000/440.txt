Try not to pester you new associate to death with all your questions.  
Congrats on getting help.  Maybe this means the hazing is over.

Aleluya, my boss talked to one associate in the group so he can sit by me and 
help me in case I have any questions. ANY??? Maybe he can sit by me and just 
explain everything from scratch. Anyways, just wanted to let you know. 

Bye.
