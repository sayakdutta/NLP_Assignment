Virendra,

Thanks for your help.  Can you tell me why the 941776 postid is pulling two 
books?  What do we need to change to correct that problem?

      941701  region_cd is CENTRAGULF in ERMS and CENTGULF in RMS. (Region cd 
should be same)

Virendra,

Here are the book ids and post ids of the three books that we are having to 
manually override each night.  These books are all set up in RiskTrac and are 
officialized in Portcalc.  

BOOK ID   11/09/00 POST ID

INTRA-NORTHEAST-BAS 941776

INTRA-CNT-GULF-PHY 941701

INTRA-CNT-GULF2-PHY 941767

If you need any more information let me know.  Thanks for your help.
