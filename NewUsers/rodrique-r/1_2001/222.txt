I hadn't thought about that scenerio yet.  Actually no one's asked that, but 
everyone's asked me when I'm going to Chicago.  There certainly aren't any 
secrets around here.  I never told anyone except Jeff, David, Rock and Binh 
that I was going to Chicago and yet everyone on the floor knows.  

They're putting out the food for today.  And they brought flowers for the 
tables!!  I'm so impressed.  The food's probably not very good is they're 
going to so much trouble to dress it up.  I think it might be tortilla soup.  
Actually, I just found out we're taking Crystal out to eat since tomorrow's 
her last day.  I would invite you but then you'd just be disappointed when we 
left without you.  

Talk to ya later,
Robin

Ps  Your boss actually has a reason to be stressed today!!  I wouldn't want 
to be in that meeting.
