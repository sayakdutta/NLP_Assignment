 I couldn't schedule my car appointment for Sat.  They were booked.  So I had 
to schedule it for Monday, and you'll love this.  I need to have it there by 
9am!!  So, if you're still willing to take me to drop it off I'll buy you 
breakfast and then we can go home and take naps.  

I'm leaving now.   Goodnight.
