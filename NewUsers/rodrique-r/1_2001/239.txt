So, I take it your having a bad day.  Don't let him stress you out.  Is there 
anything I can do to help?  I'm headed downstairs to buy stamps later.   Let 
me know if you want anything from downstairs.  

No one's asked the questions I was expecting.  I think Anne was too drunk to 
remember asking.  I'm sure it'll come back up eventually.  

Are you still planning to go work out at lunch?

Hope everything gets better.
Robin
