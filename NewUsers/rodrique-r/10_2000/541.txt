You kill me...good to see you still have your sense of humor!  It will go 
away in a few months.  Mark my word!

Let's plan on Thursday!?

Thursday or Friday sounds good to me.  Hey, Dawn I noticed there were a few 
people from the group missing from your email.  Did you want me to forward it 
to them??
