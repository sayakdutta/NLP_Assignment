Glad to hear you haven't dried up and blown away.   They said we got rain 
here, but being from LA I say we got a little drizzle.  Just enough to make 
my car look like I went driving through mud puddles.  

What kind of job did Aruthur offer?  Once again let me point out that I enjoy 
the fact that this is on your company email.  

I'm spending my time these days checking the official Olympics website and 
dreaming.  I'm trying to get fired so I can just stay in Australia.  I don't 
think it's working though b/c I just keep getting more jobs.  I have two 
right now.  

Be nice and I might at least think about you while I'm in Australia.  

Talk to ya later,
Robin
