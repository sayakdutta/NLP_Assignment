I leave for Sydney a week from Saturday.  I already have orders to email my 
parents while I'm there to let them know what's going on.  And you're right 
there's no hope for keeping me in line!  I think I'll just retire early and 
stay over there.  I would make a very good beach bum.  Of course with my 
complexion I'd look like a tomato in a matter of hours (plus I already have 
the soft and squishy part down).   I went shopping and spent way too much 
money this weekend buying things for my trip.  I'm having to buy clothes.   I 
don't seem to own casual clothes anymore...especially not spring clothes.  
I'm used to only two seasons, summer and suedo-winter.  It'll be spring over 
there and I've been checking the temperature.  It's been between the mid 40's 
and the low 70's.  I'm going to have to pack everything I own.  

I'm really sorry to hear about Megan's prognosis.  I know you hear this all 
the time but seriously, if there's anything at all I can do let me know.   
And I want you to know you guys are always in my prayers.

We should go to lunch sometime now that I'm working daylight hours.  

Talk to ya later,
RR
