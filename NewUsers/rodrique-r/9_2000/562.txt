Space City Sunday

Space City Sunday is a mid-distance group run hosted by the Enron Running 
Club once a month.? The Sunday morning runs are designed to tour various 
locales throughout the Houston area.? It's a great opportunity for runners 
interested in testing distances longer than 6 miles and it gives runners an 
opportunity to have a quiet, relaxing run with friends and associates.
