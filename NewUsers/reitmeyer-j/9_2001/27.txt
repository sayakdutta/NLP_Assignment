The eagle has landed.

 

Monique, I have moved the map under Desks->West Desk-> West Map. Please check it out, let me know if there is anything else. Yan

 

Yan,

Will you please release the map out of testing into the main west ops area.  I have checked the data on a test basis and everything appears to be working properly.

Thanks
Monique
