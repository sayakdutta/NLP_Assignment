I know how much i love you and how much i missed you and how much i want to be with you.  I am keeping my promise to you where Jennifer is concerned...but I want Denver to be whatever it turns out to be.  I don't want any plans or to hype it up or to try to cut it down.  I want it to naturally flow between two people that love each other and can be together.

I Love You
