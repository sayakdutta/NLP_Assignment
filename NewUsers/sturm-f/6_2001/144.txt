Hi,

	I was doing some research on the web to find info on arbitrage in power,

	While surfing the web I came across references to your book  "Trading Natural Gas : Cash Futures Options and Swaps"
	Do you have a copy of can take a look at?  If not, I will order a copy via Amazon.com.

Thanks,
Iris

 


 

thanks for your time!
