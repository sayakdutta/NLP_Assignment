I met this guy the other day in my neighborhood.  He's the son-in-law of the people who live at the end of my street.  He seems like a good guy in person and looks like he's been close to trading.  He's local, so I thought it might not be a bad idea to bring him in.  What do you think?

Hi Fletch,


	Thanks for returning my call and for taking the time to look over this
cover letter with attached resume.  I should be heading out to the driving
range one of these weeknights. Drop me line if you're interested?

I'm looking for a position on the Enron energy trading floor. The personal
and professional qualities that make me a successful mutual fund wholesaler
will make me a strong contributor to your trading team.
	As my resume reflects, I have plenty of analytical skills combined with
hands-on  fixed income and equity trading. I have consistently grown
business because I pay attention to details and thrive in a fast-paced
environment. My experience and success in developing business has come about
through learning quickly, planning ahead, and working well within a team
environment.
I would enjoy answering your questions, and discussing how my skills and
experience could contribute to your team. Thank you for your interest in my
application, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.


Sincerely,



Dac Calderhead
