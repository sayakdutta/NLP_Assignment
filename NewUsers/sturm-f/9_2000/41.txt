Brad,

(see message below from Melba)

Which one should we use, and how should it look on the website?  Remember, 
only five characters will fit in the name.  Maybe just CNGNo?
Let me know and i'll forward to Melba.

Fletch,

US Gas Daily GD/D CNGAp-HHub - has two prices on Gas Daily .  North and South.

How do you want to difirenciate one from the other? Please let me know.

Thank you,

these looks good to me except for the lower case "h" in the Hub phys that we 
already talked about.
