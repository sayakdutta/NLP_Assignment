I got this forwarded from my mother (I'm betting the letter is fake) but it backs your idea of investing in online shopping.  What's better - the online stores or shipping services?

===================

Hi All,

I think you all know that I don't send out hoaxes and don't do the
reactionary thing and send out anything that crosses my path.  This one,
however, is a friend of a friend and I've given it enough credibility in my

mind that I'm writing it up and sending it out to all of you.

My friend's friend was dating a guy from Afghanistan up until a month ago.
She had a date with him around 9/6 and was stood up.  She was
understandably
upset and went to his home to find it completely emptied.  On 9/10, she
received a letter from her boyfriend explaining that he wished he could
tell
her why he had left and that he was sorry it had to be like that.  The part

worth mentioning is that he BEGGED her not to get on any commercial
airlines
on 9/11 and to not to go any malls on Halloween.  As soon as everything
happened on the 11th, she called the FBI and has since turned over the
letter.

This is not an email that I've received and decided to pass on.  This came
from a phone conversation with a long-time friend of mine last night. I may

be wrong, and I hope I am.  However, with one of his warnings being correct

and devastating, I'm not willing to take the chance on the second and
wanted
to make sure that people I cared about had the same information that I did.
