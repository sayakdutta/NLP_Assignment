Dave,

John Lavorato would like me to get back with him regarding exactly why we 
can't send out a pop-up window to advertise the new power products that we're 
launching this week.  Could you call or e-mail back?  He basically said he 
wants to do one, but I don't want to if it could crash all of EOL on our 
behalf.  Let me know.  Thanks,

Fletch
