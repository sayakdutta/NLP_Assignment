I don't necessarily agree, but I will check into it from this end.  Quite
often our traders truly are trading a Firm LD product instead of an "Into"
product.  As you said the EEI defines both of those.  I'll ask around.

Pam:
I am hoping that you can help me with a confirm issue.  When CP&L is the
Seller and EPMI is the Buyer, the CP&L confirm people have been marking
through our Product description which says "Into Cinergy, Seller's daily
Choice" and putting "Firm LD" instead.  Now that we are confirming under
the EEI Master which defines both of these products, we would request
that your people not mark through the description.  Do you agree and an
you facilitate this?
