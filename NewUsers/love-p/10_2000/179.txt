Good to hear from you as well.  Last I heard, you were running a dating 
service...What happened with that?

I have been at Enron for close to 3 years.  Ashley and I have a 18 month old 
son, Jackson.  Mom is doing good, as we all are.

How do you like Enron so far?  I absolutely love it.  I am in the Risk 
Management Group for Natural Gas Trading.  Dealing with the traders can be 
fun, but is usually quite challenging.  Unfortunately we have a lot of late 
nights waiting on systems - like we are right now.  What group are you with? 

Where are you living these days?  We just built a house in PineBrook in Clear 
Lake.  We had our ten year reunion last weekend...quite strange.

I don't know if you know them, but several CL graduates work here.  Meredith 
Mitchell, Dawn Kenne, Mike Pyer.

Our curves just came out, so I am going to start calcing my P&L.  Talk to you 
later.

baby on the way... How is Ashley?  Your Mom?  The baby?  I just started with 
Enron at the end of August.  What about you?  Obviously you are not with UTMB 
anymore.  It is WONDERFUL to hear from you!!!! Write Back!
