Did you see the first three games of the divisional series?  4 of the 6 
starters were former Astro pitchers - within the last three years.  Halama, 
Garcia for Seattle - Randy Johnson trade, Hampton and Kyle.  How sickening is 
that.  However, McClain has said he is going to up the budget for next year 
by....1 MILLION $, yee haw.
