Please do this ASAP...I have to head out of town for a few days and we need this done ASAP.  Thanks.  Curves are under NW and SW in the netco directory - ask Kam for help.  Thanks.

The curve files for Netco will need to be modified before they are used in the new environment.


    1)   On the Publish tab in the Curve File sheet.
Change the environment name on the 5th row to ermtp
Change the service name on the 5th row to 7525
Change the Network Address on the 5th row to ;239.44.16.1;     

2) Then hit the   button on the publish sheet and save the new file.
If the sheet does not have the button, just save the file, close it, and bring it back up.

3)	Save your curves as normal

4)	Any questions or problems, please give me a call
