Phillip:
I see the changes coming through, but I have one more problem.  PSEG terminated their contract on 11/30, so we only need to bill them for 29 days.  Can you change the volumes on the demand fees for Nov. only to a monthly volume?  I have detailed the changes below.  Thanks.

change 1,700/day to 49,300/month
change 2,500/day to 72,500/month
change 5,800/day to 168,200/month
