you absolutely amaze me.  You send me an article that describes your fans as some of the most low class fans in the country.  Nice try and getting my dander up.  FYI - Paul Finebaum was fired from the Birmingham News several years ago because of his lopsided reporting(Pro Alabama).  HE now works for the Mobile Register - you know that Pulitzer prize winning paper in Lower Alabama(come on).
