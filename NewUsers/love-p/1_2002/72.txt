FYI - here is the info I have.  As she said, not exactly the answer we wanted.  I am still waiting on a final list to cross reference with our calcs.

Stacey Richardson is researching additional transactions & we are receiving daily updates from legal regarding counterparties who have terminated either their agreements or specific transactions due to the bankruptcy. However, the deal count should begin to reduce.

Not the answer you were looking for, but the best I can give for today.

Is this the last list we are going to get?  Jeff Gossett wants to know if we are done so that we can assure Don Miller that all of the CP's have been taken care of.  Thanks.

According to the letters rec'd from Legal, applicable contract status - - - - yes.

Thank you!

 

I just want to be crystal clear on the file you sent.  We need to move all of these deals to the Bankruptcy book?  Thanks for your help.

The attached deal list are the deals behind those contracts, for those deals that are currently not included in the bankruptcy books. Please note that there are still several deals that I am trying to reconcile back to Sitara numbers. Assuming that I can do so, I will send supplemental information tomorrow afternoon.

Please feel free to contact me if you have any additional questions or concerns.

Thank you,
