Let Russ know also so he can break this up for TDS.  Have him create a roll up for South and Northwest and a total west that sums up both.

 

FYI - the west is wanting to split the region into two regions.  Stephen, I know you have been working on mapping the P&Ls for reporting purpose, the attached file breaks down those two regions.  We want to call then Southwest and Northwest.  They will be headed by Phillip Allen and Mike Grigsby respectively.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.
