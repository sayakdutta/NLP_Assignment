I just left you a voice mail and wanted to follow it up with an email regarding the termination of deals.  Please start forwarding these requests to myself and Darron Giron.  Scott is heading another project for Gossett and Darron and I will be handling terminations from today forward.  Thanks for your help and let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.

With the bankruptcy filing of ENA Upstream yesterday, please find a listing of auto-terminating deals that need to be moved into the bankruptcy books. 

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
