Season's Greetings!!

Well, I hope everyone is having a save and fun holiday season.  The good
news is that I got a digital camera so there will be a lot more pictures
available on the family album.  The bad news is that I got a digital
camera and there will be a LOT more pictures available on the family
album. ;)

Anyways, its been update from Christmas, check back after the new year
as there will probably be more from our trip to the desert this weekend.
