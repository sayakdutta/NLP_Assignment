thanks.  FYI - we will have a pretty big book move for you around lunch tomorrow and need it before 3:30 if possible.  We will be moving third party financial deals(ENA is the Enron counterparty) from NG-PRICE to ENA-FT-WC-SJ.  I will get you the list before lunch tomorrow, just thought you could get started on the script.  Thanks again.

Deal moves has been completed and retranslated.

1. move to the appropriate book based on the logic - Canadian deal needs to go to CAD
2. should only have to change deals from NG-Price to bankruptcy (deals are not in any other book)
3. The Canadian logic deals will probably be in GJ and the US logic should be in NG
4. Financial only
5. Cutoff date 1/1/2002

These are interbook deals and I need to confirm the following:

1. Which Bankruptcy book you want to move the deals to? BANKRUPTCY (166660) or BANKRUPTCY-CAD (166762)?
2. Change the counterparty of the deals associated with FT-CAND-TERMIN (166764) or FT-CAND-GONE-PR (166767) from NG-PRICE(11360), ENA-FT-WT-SOCAL(108201), ENA-WT-CAL(105544) to Bankruptcy (166660 or 166762)?
3. Should we should NGGJ as the commodity instead of NG?
4. Financial deals only
5. Cutoff date 1-jan-2002



 


Those two counterparties could be currently  in NG-Price, ENA-WT-Socal, or ENA-WT-Cal, not just NG-Price.

Thanks
