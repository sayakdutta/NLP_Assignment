I only show that we should have triggered 1127631 for December and they did not trigger 1131418 at all.  They will need to provide documentation to us - i.e. signed confirms that show this was done.  Is the trigger price they are suggesting in our favor or not?  If it is in our favor, I am sure we will change it ASAP.  Please let me know.

Phillip,

Co-Steel is claiming to have triggered two deals for Nov-01 production - 1127631, 1131418.  However, these are not triggered in the system nor can I ascertain who the trader is.  Will you verify / change these deals accordingly, please.

Thank you,
Scott Dozier
