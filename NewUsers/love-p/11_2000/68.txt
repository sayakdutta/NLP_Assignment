I am going to try and capture the accomplishments I feel are relevant.  
Hopefully you will agree:
1.  Cleaned up oustanding Ontario operational analysis variances that 
extended up to 18 mos. of age
2.  Assisted in the transition of the ontario book to a US book
3. Resolved roughly 5 million in operational analysis variances due to 
synthetic storage
4.  Assisted in the training of new team members
5. Assisted in the modification of the Operational Analysis process(phase 2 
requirements and form completion)
6. Survived first six months in risk
