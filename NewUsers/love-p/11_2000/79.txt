Man, I wish you could have made it to the reunion.  We had a really good time 
and it was good to see everybody.  What are you doing in Norway for a job?  I 
am still enjoying Enron.  I am headed to Auburn this weekend for our last 
home game of the season.  Should be fun.  If we make it over to Europe any 
time soon, we will look you up.  We will probably wait until Jackson is a 
little older so that he will enjoy it more.  How is your Pop doing?  I bet he 
hates having you so far away.  Did you purchase a new bronco when you got to 
Europe or have the old one shipped over?  Boy did we cruise in that thing.  
Stay in touch.
