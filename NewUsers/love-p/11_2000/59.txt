OK - 
Here's the demographics on the south Florida voter - 

They can play 10 
bingo cards at a time and not miss a number. 


They can juggle 53 numbers and pick 6 for the Florida Lotto, as 
well 
as select their Pick 3, Fantasy Five, and Mega Ball numbers. 


They can read 5 papers, 4 scratch sheets, and handicap 3 horses in 
the 
Tri-fecta at the horse race. 


They can spot a shanked golf ball in an acre of elephant grass 
300 
yards away. 


They can eyeball a non-resident in a 1,000-unit subdivision at 
200 
yds. 


They can report a scarred manatee at 10 fathoms to the 
Greenpeace 
hotline. 

They can take 37 different colored pills every 
morning and never mess 
it up. 

But they can't read a 4-line 
ballot both published in the newspaper AND 

mailed to them a week in advance and pick one candidate... 

You 
figure it out !!! 




Suddenly Florida makes Alabama and 
Mississippi look like geniuses.... 

?

"COME 
TO FLORIDA - The NEW Alabama......"
