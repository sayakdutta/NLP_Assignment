hey you are not wearing your target purple shirt today are you?  I have mine on and I don't want to look silly


 

and my team looks good on paper ... they just don't come to play ... RC is going to have to call them out

 

2-5, so much for the nice machine


 

From the way it is looking now ... I gave my money away anyway.

 

I have some good news and some bad news.  The good news is that I invested all of the league dues in the stock market over the last few weeks.  The bad news is that I invested it in enron stock.  So, needless to say I am going to have to default on this year's payouts.  

Sorry guys
