trip to steamboat:
Jan. 13-19 $425 a night for a house that sleeps 10.
That works out to $500 a couple for the week(6 nights).  That will give us 5 days to ski(or 4 on 1 off).
Continental flys directly to Steamboat for $300 roundtrip.
Need to know interest level ASAP. We have to pay 50% upon booking the house and %50 within 30 days of arrival.
I will pay the %50 up front, I just want a firm committment that you will be going.
Take a look at the house:
