 Phillip,

 Bharat didn't have access to the intra-IF mapping screen . 
 But we have given  him access  to Intra IF mapping screen.
 Please check with Bharat. 
  If you guys have any problem please let me know.
 Thanks,

 Nilay

 

Bharat asked that I forward this information to you.  Could you please map the following curves to the appropriate omicrons.  Monchy and NGPL-IA-IL should be mapped to chicago - omicron #11 and St. Clair should be mapped to omicron #14.  Do I need to also send this information to Burton in the controls group?  Thanks for your help.

Hey Phillip,
These are the unmapped curves.  Please let me know what OMICRONS they should be mapped to and I'll have Nilay do it.  This is your problem.  Large hedge benefits are not being captured in her books.
