Here in lies the problem.  These fix price locks are not deal specific - rather counterparty specific.  Therefore, we can not modify prices until the end of the month when we know which deals flowed volumes and which did not.  This means we have to do this the last two days of the month along with all of the other things we are doing.  For every month since May - except September we have been able to do this.  It just so happens the one time we do not do it, we had the most locks.  The problems we had in previous months were due to liquidations hitting central that should have hit Chicago.  Same deals, different issues.  Thanks.

Can we get the fixed price lock-ins with Peoples both corrected for previous month and booked correctly going forward?  Who actually does this?

I think the confusion with this lies in the fact that last month we had the same issue and I thought you put these deals that are desk to desk in tagg back on my region.  These relate to fixed price lock ins with Peoples.  I think what happened last month happened again this month which is settlements and the risk person did not get the fixed price lock ins done until the following month.  We will have to try and work on this for this month.  The problem is that they can take their volumes on several deals and we have to wait until it is completely scheduled.  Sorry for the confusion.

Melba and Phillip,

What has changed on the Peoples region that would lead you to believe these deals that we previously determined to not belong on your desk for the months of June - August now in fact belong to your desk?  These deals are the same deals that represent the 3.8 MM adjustment that cleared off those three months.

Thanks,

Jim
