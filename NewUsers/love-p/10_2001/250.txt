I apologize, I forgot to tell you earlier today that Jason and his family have not heard of this guy.  Like you said he must be in Double Springs
PL


 

I am not familiar with Wyatt Howell, but I have been away from Winston
County for 35 years.  I have complete confidence in your recommedation.  I
would like to get this over with as soon as possible, so please proceed with
the attorney of your choice.

I have not received any information from Jeff Mobley.   I have  called his
office as recent as today.  The petition for removal is ready to sign but I
have got to retain local counsel in Winston County for the purpose of filing
as it will be cheaper than having me drive to Winston County.  Are you
familiar with Wyatt Howell or his firm.  That is the firm I would like to
associate.  Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.

Just touching base to see where we are with Daddy's estate.




no response.  I have prepared a petition to have your sister removed.  I
will get it to you for your review prior to filing same.




Just touching base to see if you heard from Jeff.




Legally I cannot contact her since she is represented by an attorney.  I
will follow up with Jeff.




I can also provide you with my sister's contact info if you need it.




I have heard nothing.  I have been out of town for about 12 days and have
just returned today. I thought there might be a response from Jeff but none.
I will follow up.




Tammy,

I'm just touching base to see if you have heard anything from Jeff.
