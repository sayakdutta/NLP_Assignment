Can you please set me up in the XMS system as a manager.  One of my employees has a reimbursement that is outstanding and I would like to get it approved as soon as possible.  Thanks.

Phillip,

Anna Kulic has an expense report awaiting your approval, but the situation is that you are not set up in XMS as a manager.  After discussing it with AP on Friday you have to send an email to Judy Knepshield requesting her to add you as a manager to approve expense reports for your group.  If you could please copy me on your request (email) I will make sure it gets taken care of before the end of the da

Thank You,

AC
