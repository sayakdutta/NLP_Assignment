did you get to this?
 




Hey Bruce or Phillip,
 
Could one of you please make sure these two deals get flipped to 
the FT-US/CAND-ERMS book by 2:30 Houston time.  I'm just waiting
for these two deals to be fixed before I get started on my invoicing.
 
Please let me know if you have any questions on this.
 
Thanks
Stacey
