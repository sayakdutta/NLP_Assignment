I got the form from John with a note on it about lone liquidations.  This 
relates to a physical deal and I thought we went over the specifics 
yesterday.  This relates to 309136 for jan and 594576 for the remainder.  
This is a structured deal with John Griffith and we were unwinding a previous 
deal for 1/01-12/01, the remaining original term stayed intact.  It appears 
you are missing some liquidations that would remove this variance.  They are 
E00982.4 &.5.  

Please let me know if you have any more questions, this deal is a real pain 
in the butt.
