The broker Amerex is no longer under the short name of AMERX in deal 
capture.  From this point on, the short name is AMERG, which stands for 
Amerex Natural Gas, Ltd.  AMERX will now default to Amerex Petroleum, which 
is incorrect.  Also, the broker Spectron is no longer SPECT.  The new short 
name is SPECI, which stands for Spectron Energy, Inc. 

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,

Patrick Mulvany
