Per Laura's request, we have modified the orig schedule for Central.  I have 
attached the revised schedule.  Please note the following changes - on the 
1st tab - orig schedule, we added a column for deal value before origination 
was granted.  We will populate this field for all new deals as of yesterday.  
The other changes are the second tab.  The second tab provides a summary by 
originator of the total deals originated and total value originated.  We will 
update both schedules in the future for all deals originated whether value 
was originated or not.  We will then email this schedule to the three of you 
every time the schedule changes.  If you would prefer a hard copy, please let 
me know.

If there are any other changes or modifications you would like to see, please 
let me know.  Thanks.
