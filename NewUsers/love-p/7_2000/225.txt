Attached is the book request.  Could you please process as soon as possible.  
We are flipping Geoff Storey's book tonight to a us book(price and basis 
split out) and we will need an index book.  Sorry for the short notice, we 
were working with IT to get the conversion and just found out today that they 
did not set up a new index book.  Thanks for your help, and call with any 
questions.
