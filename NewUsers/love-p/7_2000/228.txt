Kam asked that I email you guys about the FT-ONTARIO book move.  Please move 
the book for Price, Basis and Index from FT-ONT-CENTRAL to FT-ONTARIO.  This 
also encompasses splitting out the price and basis and fixing the curves in 
the curve table.  This needs to be done by Monday night, 7/31.  Thanks for 
you help and please shout with any questions.
PL
