Attached is the revised model with all of your transport deals from yesterday 
and the farwell deal.  Please review and let me know if you agree with this.  
If you agree, we will unwind/kill the TAGG deals and book the spreadsheet 
amounts.  We are still working on the spread option and foreign exchange 
being included in this model.  For the foreign exchange,  I took an average 
exchange rate for the life of each deal for now.  Thanks.
