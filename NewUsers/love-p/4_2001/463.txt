I did get the tickets in.  Don't worry about a check, just give me the money 
in NO.  I am totally siked.  Been a long couple of weeks and looking forward 
to hitting the fest early with my road dog to play some hacky and drink some 
beer before the crowd joins us.

We are getting close. Two weeks from today. Did you get the Jazz Fest
Tickets? If we need to send you a check
let us know!
