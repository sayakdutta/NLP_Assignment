Jeff,

Can you pass on the message below to all of risk.  For EnronOnline, no trades 
should be "reversed" in TAGG.  Simply kill the deal and we'll take care of 
the documentation.

thanks,
Joe Hunter

Per my discussion with Mark Taylor and our conversation today, attached is 
the form of Termination Agreement that should be used when terminating 
EnronOnline mistake or "oops" trades.  The trades should continue to be 
initially run past the Legal Department to determine whether there are any 
unusual circumstances surrounding the trades, but absent unusual 
circumstances, Legal will then pass the trades on to the Confirmation Desk 
for preparation of the Termination Letter and further handling.  These same 
procedure should apply to physical as well as financial transactions.

Since this is a contract, the agreement will require the initials of a lawyer 
and signature of a VP or above for the relevant company.  The Termination 
Letter should be brought to the appropriate Legal Group for signature.

The current policy with respect to mistake trades is that the trade should be 
terminated.  Reverse trades should not be entered into.

If you have any questions, please call.
