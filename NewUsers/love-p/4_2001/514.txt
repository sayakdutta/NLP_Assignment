Attached is the final standings for the pool.  Please verify your score.  We 
had a little drama for second place, Chuck won the tie breaker due to a total 
of 158 versus Wolfie's 145(total score was 154).  Special congratulations to 
Matt Lenhart for bringing up the rear(nice pick on the last game too).  Hope 
to see you guys next year.
