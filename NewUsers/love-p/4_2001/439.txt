I wanted to ask a favor.  Would you mind reminding your group to please let 
us know when they change a pipe or trading zone or add a location to a deal 
in sitara.  If we do not catch this change, the trader will be getting the 
deal at contract instead of mid, because the swap does not automatically 
update when you change the physical deal.  If the change is simply a meter, 
that will not effect the pricing of the deal.  Thanks for your help.
