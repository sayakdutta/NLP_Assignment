grab me tomorrow and let's discuss.  I am not aware of which calc sheets she had to do, so let's look at them together and go from there.  I know Melissa does some also.  Thanks for pulling double duty training Michelle and doing the east desk.  Hope you had a good thanksgiving.

Alejandra gave me a 5 min. crashcourse through the four calc sheets she updates at the end of the month.  I know that Kam knows about them so I'll just check with her but Alejandra also recommended splitting up these four sheets among everyone else to lighten the load...just a thought for next month.  Also, after training Michelle on Gd-Central and Gulf I definitely feel (hopefully not a false sense) ahead of the curve about the things i've learned...a compliment to your work also.
