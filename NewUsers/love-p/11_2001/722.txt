That is fucking hilarious.  It would be even funnier if it had been you that got kicked out instead of me...I have already talked to the bartender and he understands that in the future, we pour our drinks in the bathroom, not right in front of stadium personnel...Also, next year - he is sitting with you!

Guys,
I had an incredibly fun time...just wish we could have made that phenomenal Bears game!!  Though ya'll might get a kick out of these photos.  The FYI attachment is for the bartender, the fucking fucks is for everyone's appreciation.  Enjoy and stay in touch!
