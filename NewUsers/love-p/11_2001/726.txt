It's that time again to complete your hours for October 2001.  Please have the Survey completed with your hours and activities by Tuesday, November 6,  2001. Please go to the following path O:\Energy_Ops\OPM Hours Survey\ProdUser_2000 (use ProdUser_97 if you have not converted to Windows 2000) in Access 2000 to access the hours survey.  Also, since we are the beginning of a new quarter, the headcount portion of the survey will need to be completed.   

As a reminder for how we use this data, it is being used as a critical piece of our process in reporting mid office cost analysis to upper management and commercial groups for pricing of mid/back office services.  Feel free to call me if you have any questions or need me to help you complete the survey.  

Thanks,
Roxanne
