Kam and Phillip,

I understand you all have been a little busy lately.   When you get a free moment would you please send me an updated copy of your Cost of Inventory schedules for Central and East.  We have until late tomorrow to book the value.  One nice thing about the West Desk is no storage COI.

Thanks,

Jim
