FYI - reminder that the last person here every night needs to publish to the web the East P&L and the East Positions.  Everyone should have access to this and if you do not know how to load these files, let me know.  We have all been guilty of forgetting this, including myself.  We owe a big thank you to Kulvinder who has saved us a couple of nights in the last week.  Thanks.
