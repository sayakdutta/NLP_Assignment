0011 Lone liquidation variances:
CES-Dynegy - these tagg numbers are EFP deals and we had variances show up in 
forms and we should have used these to clear.
ECS - this tagg number has a sitara deal - 309408 that did not flow.  The gas 
that was suppossed to flow on this deal, flowed on 310637 - Northern 
Natural.  This tagg should be part of that variance for settlements. 
Reliant Energy - that is a synthetic storage deal that flowed, sitara 
#456560, again, no variance to the desk.
Move WPL variance to its own line and we will take the remaining variance to 
the desk.
