Looks good to me. - I noticed a note on an ECC purchase - Q29840 - sitara 
killed, the wrong sitara number is on that tagg - the correct number is 
430538.  I made the change in tagg.  The transcanada liquidation that are not 
highlighted are the exchange deals that are not showing up in the GL.  This 
is the huge problem that seems to not ever get resolved.
