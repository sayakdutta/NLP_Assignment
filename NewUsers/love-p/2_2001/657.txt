The tickets for HOB will go on sale around next wednesday.  I will call and 
get them.  I am starting to get pumped as well.  Luckily I have a trip to 
Vegas in March that will hold me over.  

I need to find my hand hacky sack so we will have a back up plan.  I have a 
couple of new chairs in a bag for us - full lounge chairs.  They even have 
beer holders in the arms.

P, we are getting close. Did the Tickets go on sale  for any of the concerts 
at the House of Blues?
?
We need to come up with a gimmick for the fest!  Like the Hand bean bags.
?
See you soon.
