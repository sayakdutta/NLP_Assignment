Just wanted to let you know that we are having global counterparties in 
Houston inactivate the spot contract we have with Sunoco Inc so that anyone 
that tries to book a deal to this entity wil have to get a contract in place 
or get this one reactivated.  This difficulty should send up a red flag and 
keep deals from flowing with this counterparty.  Please let me know if you 
need any further information.  Thanks.
PL
