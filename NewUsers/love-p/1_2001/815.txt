this is the kid from opelika correct?  I heard when he committed last week, 
all the publications took him from a 5 star to four star.  SOunds like a 
little biased alabama propaganda.

I talked with the guy at the vet school today about donations in PaPa's 
name.  He was telling me to call him anytime I am down there and he will get 
us a tour of the eagle's new digs and the entire raptor center.  Sounds like 
a lot of fun.  Let me know if you are interested during football season.
