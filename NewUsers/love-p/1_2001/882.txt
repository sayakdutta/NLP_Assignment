Jim,
Please adjust the sithe storage account to a price of $0, instead of wacog.  
This adjustment should not have to go back any further than 11/99.  The 
Pipeline is Union Gas Limited and the storage contract number is 96041510.  
Please shout with any questions.  Jennifer, this should eliminate the current 
outstanding variances and create a variances for all past months that have 
been cleaned up.  The P&L impact of the new variances should be minimal due 
to the small volume nature of these transactions in the past.  I believe the 
variances will be a gain.
Thanks for you help guys.
