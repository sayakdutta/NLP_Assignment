We have received the April Liquidation file from portfolio accounting.  We 
are now up to 89%(Tagg deals containing Sitara #'s) with only a small handful 
containing Sitara #'s that are invalid(13).  Thanks for the work that you and 
your groups have done to make it easier to match up deals on the back end of 
the process.  Again, thank you.

John
