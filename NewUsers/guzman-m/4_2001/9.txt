I have set up the following BPA account numbers since we have been submitting 
dec bids at Malin the past few days:

CISO to PUGET  882716
CISO to WWP       681713
CISO to SCL         882790
CISO to Tacoma 882791

I realize these counterparties can pick up at malin however, I thought it 
would be useful to have these accounts set up in case they are unable or 
unwilling to pick up at Malin. Also I have added an account number for 
Turlock to SCL.  SCL has been willing to do Buy/Resales from their system to 
Malin recently and this should be useful given that Snohomish has recently 
been unwilling to do so.
 
TURLOCK to SCL  790612

These numbers have all been added to the RT BPA Account #'s spreadsheet in 
P:/realtime.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.
