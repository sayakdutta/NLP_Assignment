Bill, for approximately 2 and a half hours on (2:20-5:00am MST)  the scrape 
was completely down.  There was no access to it at all.  To maintain the 
model and also to properly run the units i maintained 15 minute verbal 
contacts with Generation, and updated the scrape based on the numbers that 
they gave me.  The numbers appeared good and there were no problems for those 
hours.  Apparently this also happened to Holden earlier on 12/23.  I also had 
one hour on 12/23 (HE 24) that was not working correctly either.  Thought I 
should let you know.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.
