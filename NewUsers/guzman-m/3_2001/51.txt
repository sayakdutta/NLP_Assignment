Portland actually becomes a happening town for one day a year and that day is 
St Patricks Day.  There are several pretty cool places that we can go 
downtown that will be having pretty decent sized parties.   What is your 
schedule for the weekend?  I have Thursday off, work Friday, Have Saturday 
off and work Sunday, howe-ver, I think I have someone to work for me on 
Sunday.  Anyway, let me know your plans, here is my phone number in case Dahl 
doesn't have it.  Home  503-228-7767   Cell 503-702-0463.  Lets grab some 
green beers!
