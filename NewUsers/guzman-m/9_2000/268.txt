I don't even know Dave so I wouldn't judge him.  I just worry about you being 
with someone that has a bad temper like that.  You know eventually that 
temper might be aimed at you.  I know you can take care of yourself and I am 
sure he is a great guy and wouldn't do anything to hurt you but that doesn't 
mean I can't worry about ya.  :)   So I didn't go anywhere last night.  I am 
feeling pretty sick and Burnsy's flight got cancelled so he didn't get in 
until about 12 last night.  I haven't talked to him yet today and last time I 
talked to him i told him I had plans tonight which have been changed.  I 
would like to go out with him but I don't really feel like drinking and I am 
really trying to cut back on it.  This thing with my dad has really scared me 
about drinking and bieng more healthy.  I am not pretending that I am going 
to stop drinking I just think it would be a great idea for me to cut back on 
it.  There is no need for me to get as drunk as I did last weekend.  Boy is 
that a great story! If I do go out with Burns tonight should I call you?
