Its no big deal.  I just had really bad asthma when I went down to wilsons 
house and he had that dog and ended up sleeping in my car which kind of 
sucked.  If they are going to be outside or in the garage I may still come 
down Friday night or just come down Saturday and stay the night saturday 
night down there with you guys.  I will let you all know tonight
