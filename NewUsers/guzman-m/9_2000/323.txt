I am doing pretty good.  I have been really busy lately.  And the work 
situation should be resolved sometime next week as I am interviewing for two 
other internal positions on the trading desk.  Family is okay I guess. Dad is 
not doing well at all and was almost checked into the hospital yesterday.  
Angela is really really worried about him and we talk just about everyday.  I 
am in the process of getting the documents for power of attorney in case 
anything happens to him and he is incapacitated or something.  I had a very 
interesting weekend last weekend.  Just a whole bunch of crazy shit 
happened.  It was all fun stuff though.  How about you?
