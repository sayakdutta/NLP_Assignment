John, I wanted to thank you for taking the time to discuss with me the 
opportunity available in the Real Time Group.  Based on our discussion and 
after further consideration I feel that it would be an excellent fit for both 
the Real Time Group and myself. With my prior and current work experience and 
knowledge of the enpower system,    I am confident that I will be a valuable 
asset to your team.  I look forward to the opportunity and eagerly await your 
positive response.  Please feel free to contact me with any questions or 
concerns you may have.  Once again thank you for the opportunity.
