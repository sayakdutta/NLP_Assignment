I have a problem,  I just accepted a new position at my work.  The hours are 
really fucked up and are kind of like fireman hours where I have to work some 
night shifts and weekends but get several days of in a row afterward.  I 
won't find out my schedule for the month until next week so there is a 
possibility that I may not be able to go if i am scheduled to work that 
weekend.  I realize I will get some shit for this but at least I am not using 
the OPERA EXCUSE.  I will let you guys know as soon as I get my new schedule 
but, if I am off on that weekend i am definetly in.   
Memo to Jones:  You HAVE to come up with some better excuses if you don't 
want to get hazed.  The Opera!  REALLY GUY?!?!?!?!?!?!?!!?!?!?








Hey, I told everybody to leave the first two weekends in November open, then
I asked what your preference might be.  Hsu was the only one who gave a
preference.  Macy's birthday is the first weekend.  Why is this the first
time you decided to mention the friggin opera.  Give a ticket to Cindy or
whoever and nut up and go bag a bull.
