Well, sorry to hear your weekend sucked so bad.  Mine was pretty awesome.  I 
was actually very sick but ended up going out and doing stuff anyway since 
Burns was in town I just didn't drink.  On Friday night a bunch of us met up 
with Burns at Silver Dollar Pizza.  We hung out there for a while and then 
went to the Gypsy.  I came home rather early since I wasn't drinking and 
didn't want to stay in the smokey Gypsy when i was sick.  Then on Saturday 
Valarie, Boyd and I drove down to the Beavers game. We had the best time.  We 
went to the peacock first and the  tailgated before the game.  Burnsy, Sul, 
Shef, Chris and Jimmy were so retarded by gametime.  I felt like a big 
babysitter being the only sober one.  The game was awesome and everyone but 
me valarie and boyd stayed down in Corvallis.  Sunday I was still feeling 
sick but went to breakfast and shopping with Cheryl and then we justed vegged 
at her house, watched some football, then went to the movies.  For being sick 
and not touching a drop of alcohol all weekend I remarkebly had a great 
time.  I still don't feel very well and had to go to the doctor yesterday 
becuase I started having some bad asthma.  T  Everything else is going okay I 
guess.  I have my final interview for that position I want on Thursday and 
then on Friday I leave for LA .  So anyway, hope your week is going a little 
better than your weekend went. Doesn't sound like you had much fun.  Were you 
and Dave in a fight because he flaked on you or was it something else?
