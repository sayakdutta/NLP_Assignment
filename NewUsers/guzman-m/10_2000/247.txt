Sounds like a blast.  My work thing was fun.  I broke my sobreity and got 
really drunk, went home and passed out at 8pm.  I was totally loaded.  It was 
very fun though. My interviews went awesome yesterday.  I think I will get 
that job.   So what do you have planned for the weekend?  Anything exciting?
