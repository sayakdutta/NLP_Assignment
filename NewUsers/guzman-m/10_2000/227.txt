Yeah, I think I left a bunch of shit in those cupboards that night.  I miss 
that apartment to because it was so nice however, I love where I live now.  I 
never leave downtown anymore.   I only go out to places downtown pretty much 
and I don't have to drive if I want to go out for a few drinks.  I love 
northwest.  So how is it working out with the Kim thing.  Are you going to 
move out soon?  
As far as working nights goes the first night went fine and I was not even 
tired.  I am working tonight and Saturday night also.  I have next weekend 
off which will be nice.  Once I am up to speed I wont have to work nights. i 
will be working half the time nights and half the time days, so that will be 
a little better.  And it will be awesome to have a six day break once a 
month.  Not to mention the 10% raise!  Anyway have a great weekend.  Hey and 
if you are interested in grabbing lunch on Monday or a drink after work I 
have the day off.  Give me a call if you are interested. Otherwise I will 
catch up to ya later!
