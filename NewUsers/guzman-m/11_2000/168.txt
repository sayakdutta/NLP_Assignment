Les, we were unable to find power at a reasonable rate for the  HE 5 2MW 
schedule so we therefore we just didn't show up in the PX for that hour.  The 
only offer we recieved was for $225 which I felt was too steep to pay.  It 
turned out well however as the PX price was $120 and there was no cong at 
Mead so we saved them a little money by not buying the $225.  Just thought I 
would let you know.
