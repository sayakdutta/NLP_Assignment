So what the hell is Kims problem.  You have been telling her for months that 
you were going to move out.  What a bitch.  Regarding the Nicole thing it 
really isn't that big of a deal anyway.  When I am down there we go out but 
it's not like we are together or anything.  I wouldn't let them hassle me 
affect whether I would date her or not but sometimes I just get a little sick 
of hearing about it all the time.  Nicole is awesome and I like dating her 
while I am down there.  It is just a wierd situation.   About the moving to 
LA thing it really is a job issue at this point.  It will be hard to find a 
job as good as the one that I currently have and that is going to be the real 
issue.
