Hello, Shelley!     I just want to confirm that this speech is just a talking 
speech.    The word slides is used, and I just want to confirm that there are 
no 35mm slides involved....correct?

Attached is a draft presentation for Stan to use during his 15 minute 
pipeline safety update at the Natural Gas Council meeting in Houston on 
November 29.  Please view the attached file in notes format to see the 
talking points.  Stan plans to handout copies of the slides.

Dave/Phil/John -- please check the slides for accuracy.

The current draft does not make mention of a possible voluntary program or 
request and particular support from the Natural Gas Council.  We may want to 
add these points.  Also, the attached draft does not reflect any points from 
the NTSB hearings being held this week.
