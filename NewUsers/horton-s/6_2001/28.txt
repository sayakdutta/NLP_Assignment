The name sounds ok to me.  Better than EOTTMTBE<LP et al.

 

For Project Timber, we need to pick the name for the partnership.  It does not have to be formed by Friday, but we need a name to put in the letter to State Street Bank and Trust.   What about EOTT Clean Fuels, L.P.?  Please let me know as soon as possible.  Note:since this partnership is only in Texas, we do not need to spell out Limited Partnership.  Thanks.
