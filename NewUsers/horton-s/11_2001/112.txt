I am sorry I did not get to you first and let you know.  My apologies.  I really appreciated your interest in the position and your commitment to ETS.  You are a quality individual and I respect you for that.  Thanks.

 

Stan:  

Shelley informed me this morning that it has been decided that Steve Hotte will remain at EGS as the CIO.  I wanted you to know that I believe this decision is the best outcome for your organization at this time.  

In addition, I wanted to express my appreciation for considering me for the CIO position.  Although I have been at Enron a short time, I am pleased that I have the support of your management team and have exhibited to them that I have the capabilities of operating at the officer level.  

As we go through the inevitable changes that will occur through the merger, you have my commitment that I will focus my team on their ETS projects.  I truly believe we can impress Dynegy with our outstanding pipeline operations and our strategic initiatives.  

Thank you,

Brad Holmes
