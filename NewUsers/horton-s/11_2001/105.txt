I trust everything is going well.  Please let me know if there is anything I can do.  At the next Board meeting I am sheduled to provide the Board with an update of Enron Global Services.  Could you have someone prepare a couple of slides on Portland.  One should deal with the major accomplishements of your group in 2001 (ie rate case etc) in bullet form.  The second should be an update of the deal with NNG.  Perhaps a summary of the deal and then where we are in the timeline of key events.  Call if you have questions.  Thanks.  The Board meeting is scheduled for December 6th.
