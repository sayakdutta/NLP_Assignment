I think we should add to the letter "each year the Chairman of the Natural Gas Council has to privilege to name two individuals to the Council.  The experience you have gained as both a state and federal regulator coupled with experience working in the private sector makes you an excellent addition to this years Council."  A similarly worded phrase could be added to Rick's.Thanks

 

Have any comments?

 


Cindy please have Mr. Horton approve/change the attached letter.  This letter will also be sent to Rick Richard.  Later little one.
