I can't begin to tell you what my days  are like now.  Unbelievable is the =
only way I can Describe it.  Not much time to do anything.  Stress is at a =
record high.  We will get through this though.

Love, Daddy

 


Howdy Daddy!!!!  Wassup!?!?!?!  Not much  here.  I just got out of my b.law=
 test and am proud to report that I  thought it was easy and am pretty sure=
 I did really well on it.  I will try  to be on the computer more in the ev=
enings.  I guess it's one of those  whenever I'm on you're not and whenever=
 you're on I'm not because I never see  you on when I am in the evenings.  =
I will try to catch you online at night  though because I miss our evening =
chats on the IM too.  I love you and  can't wait to be home for 4 days over=
 Thanksgiving.  I've missed seeing you  so much.  We've both been so busy a=
nd have had a hard time getting together  lately.  We'll go do some fun stu=
ff and spend some quality father/daughter  time over Thanksgiving break tho=
ugh.  I really do miss you bunches.   Anyway, I better get going.  I have a=
 bunch of homework and an accounting  test to study for so I better get to =
it.  The weather here today is really  nasty too.  There was a tornado in B=
oerne and it hit Double Diamond where  the horses used to be and ripped the=
 roof off of the main barn.  Creepy  huh.  I was thankful mine weren't ther=
e anymore when I heard that!!!   Well, just thought I'd let ya know.  I lov=
e you and will call you  tonight.
