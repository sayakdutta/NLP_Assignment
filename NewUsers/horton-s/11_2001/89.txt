Looks like I need to cancel.  My wife reminded me that I promised to take my daughter to lunch on Saturday. She hasn't been home in a month and I would like to see her.   Can you play on Sunday morning?  If so I will try and get a t time.  Let me know.  Thanks.

 

No Problem.  Give me a call on my cell if you can't make it 281-798-7317.
