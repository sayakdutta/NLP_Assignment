I agree the timing is awful.  By this memo I am asking Gary Smith to see if this can be expedited in any way.




Stan,
 
We need to get access to our Employee Savings / ESOP plans ASAP. They are currently tied up  while the Savings Plan moves to a new administrator. I cannot believe the timing of this move. It couldn't have come at a worse time.
 
Thanks,
