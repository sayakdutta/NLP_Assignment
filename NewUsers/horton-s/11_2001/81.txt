I'll be fine.  Thanks for thinking of me.  I am more worried about the 13,000 people that work for me. Tough time bro'!  I noticed yesterday that my hands were staring to tremble a bit.  I think I need some time off when this is over..not too much time though.

doing now. It sure doesn't sound very good foe alot of the officers or ex
officers these days. I know your busy take care  Ken
