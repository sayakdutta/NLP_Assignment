Ken has forwarded to me your letter of October 18 wherein you asked how Enron wanted to handle several activities which you are now engaged (Trojan nuclear plant decommissioning, contract review for offshore sales and rep agreements and involvement in Transparency International).

Ken has asked me to work with you on this.  Please let me know a good time to discuss.  Thank you.
