Thanks Frank.  I will look over the resumes but given Enron's current condition we are not doing any new development projects outside of the pipelines and are relying on Corporate Development to assist with asset sales.  Given all that I don't believe I have a spot for anyone.  Quite frankly, I am concerned about keeping all that I have.

 

Stan - 

Attached are the resumes of the key people that have worked with me for the last year and half.  They are Marc Hensel, Martin Sacchi, Bradford Brooks and Corbin Barnes.  I believe they are some of the brightest commercial people at Enron, and in particular have a lot of experience with corporate development, M&A, asset purchases and sales (including international experience).  They are also incredibly hard working people.  

Please let me know if your interested, or feel free to contact them directly.

Frank
