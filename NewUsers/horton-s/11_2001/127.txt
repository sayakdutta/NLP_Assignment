Yes the weather has turned somewhat colder.  Busy day.  Call tonight. Love you.

Hi there!!!  I hope you are having a good day  (or at least as good as is possible on a Monday!!!).  Nothing exciting here  to report.  The weather is dreary and windy and getting very cold.   Has it hit in Houston yet?  Well, getting ready to do some homework and go  to my last class.  I love you and will talk to you later.
Love,
Caron
