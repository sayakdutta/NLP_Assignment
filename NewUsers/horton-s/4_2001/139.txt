Stan,
          Now that Enron owns 100% of Wessex, we need to look into whether 
Enron Direct could utilize Wessex's customer data base as a new sales 
channel, and whether we Wessex could farm-in Enron Direct's invoicing 
services (there is certainly money to be saved and /or made here).  Matthew 
Scrimshaw (President of EES-Europe) would like to explore these and other 
possible synergies in the near future.  Maybe you could schedule an hour with 
him when you are in the UK.
