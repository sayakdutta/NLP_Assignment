I would appreciate if each of you could provide a brief (one-page or less) 
bullet point summary of the week's activity by close of business each 
Friday.  You can send either via e-mail or fax.

Jeff has his staff meetings on Monday mornings and it would help me keep him 
abreast of key activities in your respective areas.

I don't need anything elaborate.

Thanks,
Stan
