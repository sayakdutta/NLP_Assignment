Hello, Joanne!    Congrats on your new responsibilities.   I don't know Bob 
Phillips and, therefore, probably won't be talking with you like I did when 
you were with Mr. Somerhalder.

I have enjoyed our chats on the phone and you were always very courteous and 
helpful.   Good luck, and maybe we'll talk again one day soon.

Thanks,
Cindy
 






























  Effective April 20, 2001, El Paso Field Services will be
moving to a new location.  Please take note of the new information for Bob
Phillips and Jo Anne Sheriff.  For those of you outside of the company, you
might want to update our email addresses if you haven't already.  Our old
email addresses still work but I don't know how long it will be effective.

  Further, as of Monday, April 23 Emma Means will be John
Somerhalder's new assistant.  Her phone number is 713-420-4754.  She and
John will be located at the downtown office until they move in June to
Greenway 9.  She will provide the new information when the time comes.
Thank you, Jo Anne Sheriff
