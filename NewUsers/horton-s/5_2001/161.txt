It would be better if Scot contacted EBS directly about a meeting.  Kevin 
Hannon would be the right person.  Kevin is the President and COO.  I have no 
idea about whether they are in need of Spectrum's services or not.  Let me 
know when you plan to be in Dallas.  My daughter has a horse show (we own 
three Arabian Horses that she shows) in Fort Worth in mid June and I will try 
to get up there for at least some of it.








Stan;
I got your letter and company info, thanks. By the way, our President, Scott
Brown, is going to be in Dallas on the 16th and 17th of May making a
presentation to Worldcom. I thought I would check with you to see if any of
your people with Enron Broadband might be able to meet briefly with Scott on
the 15th (Tuesday) or 18th (Friday, which would be better) in Houston to
discuss our services. If they can meet just let me know dates and times and
I'll coordinate with Scott.

I still plan to be in Dallas to see Hugh King sometime in mid to late June,
and I will plan to stop down in Houston while I'm there and we can try to
get together. Thanks,

Terry
