Hello!    Stan asked that I advise you of Sunday's (May 27) golf details at
Raveneaux Country Club, as follows:

   Stan Horton
   Chris Gann
   Steve Westlund
   Julie Westlund

Tee time is 8:15AM on the Old Course off #1.  Don't hesitate to call me if
you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks,
Cindy (Stan's assistant)

After negotiations with my better half,  I will be ready to play Sunday.
My wife Julie is also willing to play on Sunday and we are trying to
arrange
for a baby sitter.  Either way,  I will be there.  Please let me know the
time when it comes available.  Thank you.

Best regards.
Steve Westlund
