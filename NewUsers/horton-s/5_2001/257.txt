Executive Committee (EC) in March and May, 2001.  To record your vote, please

The EC voting record and discussion for each of these new standards,
modifications to existing standards, interpretations or deletions of
standards is contained within the EC minutes beginning on November 16, 2000
and carrying through to the EC meeting held on May 8, 2001.  The EC minutes
can be found on the GISB home page (www.gisb.org), as can the requests,
recommendations, and related subcommittee and task force minutes.
Transcripts of the EC meetings where these recommendations were discussed can

A separate email will be sent to you containing a summary of the
