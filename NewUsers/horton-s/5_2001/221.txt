Thank you for the invitation.  Unfortunately Debbie and I will not be able to 
attend due to previous committments.









I would like to invite you and a guest to join me for the annual Juvenile
Diabetes Foundation Gala to be held on May 12, 2001 at the Westin Galleria.
The guest speaker this year will be General Norman Schwarzkof.

Please contact Cathy Phillips (X-36898) and let her know if you are
interested in attending.  Thank you.
