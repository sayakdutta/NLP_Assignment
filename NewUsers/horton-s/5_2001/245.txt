Anything I can do to help?








Dear Board Task Force,
Bill Boswell also noted the following conversation that occurred today:

"Rae -- and just to fill in the blanks, Betsy Moler called this morning to say
that Mike McGrath had called her seeking support for his position.  She told
him his position was wrong and that the EEI board members wanted to work on
the strawman first and to have something to look at in June on that - not
the retail quadrant - although the two efforts could proceed at the same
time.  Owens and I agreed to talk on Monday following the NERC meeting to
set up an EEI/GISB board level meeting ASAP.  Mike will not be a part of
that effort; Dave Owens will. -- Bill"


Thanks, Rae
