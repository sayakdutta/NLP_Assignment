This is to advise you that we have canceled next Wednesday's ETS Half Day 
Staff Meeting.    Our next meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, August 15, 
from 8:30AM to 1:00PM in 49C2.    We are taking a summer break to accommodate 
vacation schedules.

Don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions or concerns with this 
notice.

Thanks,
Cindy
