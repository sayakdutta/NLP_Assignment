My dear friends & teammates: Dave, Max, Steve, Marc, Ricardo, Jaime & Agust?n,

 As we say in Spanish:      "LO PROMETIDO ES DEUDA"

You must remember that  last year I made an invitation to the Mexican team, 
to my house in Puerto Escondido, Oax.
to celebrate the financial closure of the Vitro Project, and the excellent 
results of year 2000.

The dates selected are Friday, Feb. 16 to Sunday, Feb. 18. I have reserved 
Airplane seats on Aereocaribe, leaving
Mexico City on Feb 15, 6:20 P.M., and returning Feb. 18, 8:40 P.M.

This will be an all bachelor's weekend, with Marlin fishing, water skying, 
surfing (if you can do it), etc., etc., etc.
Please reserve the dates, and let me know if you can join in.

Regards, jaime____
