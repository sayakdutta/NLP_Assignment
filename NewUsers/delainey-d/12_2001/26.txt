Dave,
Thanks for stopping by today.  I've enjoyed working with you.  You're an outstanding leader, and I don't say that lightly.  It's disappointing that we won't finish what we've started.  However, I'm confident this will work out for the best.
 
Below is my contact information.  If you can provide me with your contact information, I'd like to take you up on your offer to be a reference...I'll use it judiciously.
 
If you need someone down the road that is dedicated, capable and will get the job done, please keep me in mind.
 
Have a great holiday.
 
Regards,
Mike Harris
