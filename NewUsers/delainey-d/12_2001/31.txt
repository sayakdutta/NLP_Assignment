That sounds reasonable.  We will have to talk to the people.

Guys, it has come to my attention that there is some discussion to move critical retail risk management and structuring personnel (Rogers Herndon, Dale Furrow, Don Black, Bernie Aucoin, Edith Cross, etc) into NETCO before complete discharge of duties from the retail organization.  It is my expectation that this discharge will not occur until the all EES retail risk contracts are valued and discharged (termination or sale) in an orderly fashion that maximizes value to the estate.  After completion of this effort, these people will be available to the corporation to move to whatever effort you deem appropriate.  I would expect this to take the next four weeks.

Thanks
Dave Delainey
