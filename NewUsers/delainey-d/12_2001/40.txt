Jimmie, I assume that you and Tracey are formulating the options and populating the detailed financials on those options for the board meeting next week.  It would be great if we could see that a couple days in advance.

David, we should probably call a follow up board meeting for next Wednesday or Thursday.

Vicki, we need to speak about the board participation issues and the cash management issues discussed.

Delainey
