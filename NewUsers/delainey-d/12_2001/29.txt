Peter, I don't have any contacts at RWE; however, if you need a reference do not hesitate to give me a call. I will be at the Enron number for the next several weeks.

All the best in the future.

Dave, I only stopped by to see if you have any strong contacts within RWE.  I may have an opportunity there and would appreciate your help.  Please let me know if you do, advise the name and I'll take it from there.

Thanks much for your support and confidence over the past few months.  It's done a lot for the Lilly relationship. Your organizational skills and gift for plain talk have inspired confidence. It's been fun.

Sincerely,

Peter
