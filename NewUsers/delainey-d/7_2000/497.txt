Due to a conflict with Dave and Mark's calendars I need move the East 
Midstream QBR to Monday August 14, 2000.



  
  Time:  1:00 pm - 4:00 pm

  Location: 3321

  Topic:  East Midstream QBR



Please mark your calendar and plan to attend. I am extremely apologetic for 
any inconvenience this may have caused. 


Thanks,
