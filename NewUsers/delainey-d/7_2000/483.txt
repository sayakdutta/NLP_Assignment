Well, we have a slight problem.  Mark has just replied to my memo and he will 
not be in Houston on that date.  Could we make it for August 28, 2000 ?

Thanks,

Dave and Mark have asked me to arrange a meeting, QBR HPL/LRC/Upstream 
Origination, and I would like to know if August 22, 2000 from 1:00 - 5:00 pm 
will work for all of you?

Thank you in advance for your promt attention to this matter.


Thanks,
