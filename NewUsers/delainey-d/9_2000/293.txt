Jim, agree with you - why don't you set up some time for us to speak and go 
through the Regulatory report and iniatives.

Dave -

FYI.  

While comprehensive electricity reform legislation looks very dead, there are 
those that are pushing "stand-alone" legislation before Congress.  Attached 
is a letter that Enron will sign on to that opposes stand-alone PUHCA 
reform.   This bill is being pushed by Mid-American.

Government Affairs continues to oppose all stand-alone legislation.  
Basically our only real leverage is to keep PUHCA, PURPA, reliability, and 
wholesale access legislation linked in a comprehensive bill.  This may incent 
the holdouts to agree to our needs.

If you need any additional information, please let me know.

Thanks,

Jim

Unless we hear concerns from you, we plan to lend Enron's name to the 
attached letter to the Congressional leadership opposing the MidAmerican 
attempt to pass modified, stand-alone PUHCA repeal.  Others signing-on so far 
include:  ELCON, TAPS, Calpine, City Utilities of Springfield, Consumers for 
Fair Competition, Missouri River Energy Services, and Northern California 
Power Agency.  The letter is to be sent Thursday, September 21st so please 
advise if you have concerns no later than close of business the day before.

Thanks.
