Because of a scheduling conflict earlier in the month, we had to cancel our 
original plans for dinner.  The plans have been revised as follows:

  DATE:  August 18, 2000
  PLACE:  The Wine Room
     River Oaks Grill
     2630 Westheimer
     713/520-1738
  TIME:   6:30 PM

If you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to contact Kay 
(3X0643) or Beverly (5X7857).  

I will look forward to seeing you there.
