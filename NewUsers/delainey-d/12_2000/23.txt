Jeff, hopefully we can convince you to come when we re-schedule - seemed like 
an easy call.

Given the current tremendous energy market volatility and as we stretch 
resources to make our commercial goals for 2000, we think it would be 
appropriate to postpone the ENA 2000 Offsite to early next year.  I trust 
this meets with your approval and thanks for all the hard work.

Regards
Dave and John
