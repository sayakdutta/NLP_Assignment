I never talk to these people so the numbers I have are old. Do they not recognize this deal?  It was scheduled so I assume the counterparty is correct. I have another number for Mike at 281-293-2203.  It could be old also.

 

Tom,

The below number is for a Duke Energy trader.  So, either this deal is booked wrong or this is not the correct trader name.  Please advise.

 

Tony ? at 713-6276215

 

Tom,

Please inform me of the CMS Field Services trader on deal #1027152 plus any additional information that you might have.

Thank you,
