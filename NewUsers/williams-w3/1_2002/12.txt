Chris,
I have some information regarding our payment to MPC that you and I discussed yesterday. Apparently we cut them a check for $19,937.35 (or thereabouts). The check no. is 9600043219. The check was cut on 01/15/02. MPC does not know why they received this payment. Rich Bruegger is my contact at MPC. Please let me know what I can do to help.

Thanks,
Bill
