Group,
Beginning tomorrow, August 25th, we will be scheduling for California on Saturday and Sunday. Serena has put together a training manual outlining the process. The ST-CALI group will be on call to answer any questions or to help us handle cuts. This should be a simple integration into our Saturday and Sunday shifts. Please see me with questions, and be prepared with comments and/or concerns for our meeting the first week of September.

Thanks,
Bill
