I am sorry to hear this Julie. 
I appreciate your effort and do not envy your task of informing the candidates of our change in plans.
Let me know if there is anything I can help with.

Due to the current state of affairs we are canceling all of the Associate / Analyst recruiting.  

Thank you for being such great team players!  We really appreciate your effort.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thank you!
