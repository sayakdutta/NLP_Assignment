Group,
We all knew it was coming. NERC Compliance surveys are continuining. Everything must be tagged both light load and heavy load. THIS INCLUDES SCHEDULES IN THE SOUTHWEST. Templates and POR/POD sheets are available. If you have any questions regarding our policy please let me know.
Let's be especially sharp for HE 14 on the 17th.

Thanks,
Bill

 

Bill, 

There's going to be a NERC E-Tag survey on Saturday 17th for HE 1400 PST.  CA's will be reporting who is and who isn't in compliance.  I received a call today to remind us of this from PGE transmission.  Apparently, they have been noting, as practice who's in compliance and who isn't, and I guess our stats aren't looking good.  We just need to make sure we submit tags for every transaction whether is on time or late.
