Any word?  We need those cards and passwords...

Chip,

As we figured out a couple of weeks ago, most of our ADS cards have expired.  We were then using Brett Hunsucker's card.  If you remember, we were waiting on the CAISO to send us new cards and new passwords about two weeks ago.  Unfortunately Brett's card appears to have expired this morning as we can no longer log in.  We are consequently unable to communicate with the CAISO over the ADS.  We may now be in violation of our participating generator agreement with the CAISO.  Is there something that I can do to speed this process, perhaps lodge a complaint with the CAISO or our client rep?  Do you have any ETA from the CAISO on our cards and passwords?  All your help is appreciated.

Thanks,

Bill
