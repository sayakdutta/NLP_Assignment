Just wanted to congratulate you guys on the excellent work on the night of the 13th.  The SAR was within $4 of risk managment's numbers on the Daily Position Report!  The night note looked very good (great job on the services portion) and there were ZERO problems with the shift.
The hard work is much appreciated, keep it up.

Bill
