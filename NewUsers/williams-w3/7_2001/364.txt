Are you kidding me?  This is absurd.

 

Wanna go?

 

You are invited to a Partylite candle party at my home on Saturday, August 4, at 2:04 p.m.  

We'll play games, win prizes, eat dessert, and shop!  

Bring a friend (or 2 or 3) and receive a free gift!  One lucky guest will even become our "Mystery Hostess" and win an extra 15% free shopping!  (Must be present to win)

Can't come in person?  That's OK--stop by my desk and pre-order from the catalogs.

Schedule your own candle party for August or September, and receive 10% off your order!



See you there!
