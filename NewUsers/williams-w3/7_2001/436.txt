Bill,

We are trying to get a hold of a FERC staffer today but we may not get clarification for a while.  I am also talking with Yoder about what to do in the interim.

Alan,

According to this site the cap was around $71 for HE 15 and $72 for HE 18.  We had already traded for these hours when the "new cap" had been set.  This is a retroactive cap during mitigation hours.  When trading in the hour ahead market (1 hour before energy flows) we cannot predict the Cap to Market ratio. For example: Expost is $18 right now, and the market is at $91.87.  Any recommendations?

Bill

 

A fast way to see the MCP is under Energy Prices at http://www.caiso.com/.
You'll notice that in hours 15, 16, 17 and 18 yesterday the MCP was set by
the proxy price when we were in a Stage 1 then 2 Emergency.  Other hours
were set by the previous Stage 1 cap.
