Virginia,

I spoke with Mike Swerzbin and Mike Driscoll this morning regarding an annuity from ST-Whourly to LT-NW to compensate LT-NW for energy at Montana that was not sold on June 4th.  ST-Whourly will pay LT-NW our average hourly price per mw for that energy.  That price is $23 per mw.  Please revise the annuity as appropriate.
If you have any questions, please come see myself or Mike.

Thank you,

Bill
