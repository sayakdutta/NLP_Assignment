Kate,

This is the last message from the total transfer capabilities folks.  I would like you to find this information and distill the relevant information from it.  We can go through what constitutes relevant information this afternoon.  I am working on adding you to the market status list, this will provide you with market information regarding real-time derates or market orders.  Finally, I would recommend printing the CAISO tariff off and reading it over the weekend or next few weeks.  Boring, but important.

Due to CAISO roll out of the new WEB based OASIS information, the evening
email providing Total Transfer Capabilities will no longer be sent.


On Monday, July 9, 2001 after approximately 1600 hr this information will
become available at the CAISO location http://oasis.caiso.com.

1. Select the Forecast Tab
2. 7 day Transmission usage
3. Choose the Branch Name you are interested in, or all Branches
4. Select the date range
5. Submit.

Thank you,
