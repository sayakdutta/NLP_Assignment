Darin,


Thanks,

Bill - Did Darin put in a tape request for this already?




Hi Kate,

I noticed you were not on the distribution list.

Let me know what you find out.

To whom it concerns,

I had a discrepancy with SRP for a purchase in the hour for HE 19.  I
spoke to SRP at 4:55 and again at approximately 5:02 about purchasing
energy for HE 19.  HE 20 was not part of the discussion.  I spoke to
them about the hour we were ramping into and the hour we were in each
time I spoke with them.  I decided to leave the 25mw purchase in and
review the tapes.  I have made a note of this on the model for 10/28/01.
Sorry for the inconvenience.


Thanks,
Darin L. Presto
