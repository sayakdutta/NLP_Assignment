Your helpand teaching was greatly appreciated. Seeing how the market trades and how the EOL markets are maintained gives insight that is hard to recognise on the other side.
Please let us know if we canhelp withthe daily spreadsheet oerview- ifyou wouldn't mind forwarding on vladis page for richard and I to play with and adapt to what we need- that would be great and I can sendyou ours as we begin development
I hope you wouldn't mind if I call at the end of each day for a market recap and big flow information? Let me know what you think.
I will fedex a cheque for 400 on monday - is that cool?
Thanks again and good luck
Robyn
