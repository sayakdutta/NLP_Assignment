Thanks,

Will this folder be set up today?

John,

On the O drive you will not be allowed to create folders, as this is a common drive -- so all folders are created by IT (it was this way at Enron). The exception to this rule is if you are the owner of the "main" folder ... which in this case you are.

So ... to make a long story short, YOU will be able to create folders under this path that we have requested, but your team members won't. They will have to request access to do so.

Again, it's the same process as we used at Enron
