Michael,
	I prepared the TW Marketing slides.  I have been incorporating Kim and Steve's comments.  You can work with me on any questions you have or any additional information you may need from Marketing.
	I follow-up on your notes in red.

Thx,
Lindy

Lindy, 

Michael sent me this draft today, but I think that you should review these slides since I know that you have been working on this.  Let's discuss in the morning.  Tuesday is my last day before I leave on vacation.

Thanks, Kim.

Attached is a draft presentation for credit agencies regarding TW.  Please take a look at it and provide me with your comments.  In particular, I have designated some pages that I think you can help me with, see below.  Please feel free to comment on the rest of the presentation too.

Thanks,

Michael
