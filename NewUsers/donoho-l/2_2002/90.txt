It's a kids weekend, so we'll see if we can get babysitters.

 

I'm afraid we are leaning toward the 16th now.  I hope you can still make it.

 

March 9th would  be good for us.  Thanks!

All,

Sarah and I would like to host a dinner for the gang.

Please check your calendars to see if either of these two dates work.

March 9th or March 16th.

Let me know if one, either or neither date is available.

Mark
