I had been meaning to reply to your message you sent to Tony & me a few weeks ago, after you showed us the houses on Winter Wheat.  I saw this morning that 66 Winter Wheat had an option pending =(   I love that house!  But, we are not in a position yet to make a decision about moving, so I guess it wasn't meant to be.

I just wanted to let you know that we appreciated you coming out to show us some homes the other weekend and following-up so promptly with your e:mail on other houses.  If we do decide that we're coming to the Woodlands, we will be calling you to look for a house.  We really enjoyed meeting you and think that it would be great to work with you to look for a home.

Thank you!
