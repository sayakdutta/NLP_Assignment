Please let me know a soon as possible this morning (by 9:30 if possible) what the annual dollars are we collect from NWPL & PNM for the Blanco Hub and from NWPL for the La Plata Facilities.  I need the total dollars (both the Operating and Market Services together).  I just need a ballpark number.  Whatever was the agreed to budget for 2001 on the Blanco Hub and whatever that flat fee is for the 3 years on the La Plata Facilities.

THANK YOU!!
