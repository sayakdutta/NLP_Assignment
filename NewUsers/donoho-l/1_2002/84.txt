Ken,	
	Did you tell me once that you had documented the calculations contained in the Daily Balance report?  I'm thinking (oh-oh) that I might not be able to talk with you after Friday and I wondered if you could send me a copy of your documentation &/or let me know who will have the file (Richard Hanagriff)?

Thanks,
Lindy
