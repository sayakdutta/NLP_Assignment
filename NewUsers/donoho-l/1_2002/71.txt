Hi Ken!  I heard in our Staff Mtg that you were "going over to the other side"  =)  I will miss you, but I wish you good luck.

When you have a minute, call me and let me know your reflections on your new opportunity.  I hope you're doing okay - going with the flow.

Who knows - in a few months we could be reunited - stranger things have happened!
