Thank you!

 

Here ya go!

 I did not change the 2001 prices except for Nov/Dec.                              << File: Lindypricing.xls >> 

 

TK could you update these prices for me for the Stan Presentation (one more time - it's due to Tracy on Thurs)?

I don't need the historical NYMEX again, unless Vernon has the NYMEX settle price for Jan - Sept '01 (Weren't the historical numbers from last week Inside FERC because we were having a system problem?)

I need them by tomorrow after lunch.  I'm in a meeting from 8:00 to 12:00 tomorrow.  If you have any questions, leave me a voicemail - I'll check it during break.

 


How does this look?
