Richard,
We are meeting tomorrow afternoon (internally) to discuss a possible SoCal settlement position.  Could you verify the amounts from March, 2001 through September, 2001 by lunch time tomorrow?  (I was using a combination of a spreadsheet Linda Ward had provided to me a couple months ago and inquiring in the CBS invoice system.  I want to make sure I have the most current information.)  If not, let me know your timing.  Also, have we been billing interest on the disputed amounts?  I don't see anything in the invoice system.  Please let me know.

Thanks,
Lindy
