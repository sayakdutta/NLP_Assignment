Hi, Roeline!

Attached for your review is a draft of the proposed fee letter in connection with the assignments and terminations.  Please let me know if you have any comments.

Our Confirmation Desk is in the process of revising the termination of ENA Deal No. NL0619.1 to delete the fee reference, and I will forward it to you when ready.

Please let me know when you have signoff on the other documents and I will finalize and have executed by ENA and forward to you.

Thanks!

Marie
