Linda:

Will you follow-up with Tanya in Credit as to exactly what type of documents you need copies of, or arrange for someone to go and look through her files?  Tanya's phone # is 33263.

Thanks!

Texon, L.P. looks like a liquids customer.  we do have a file. Marie, what type of "documents" are we supposed to be providing? Corp legal needs to be more specific or they can send someone down to copy our file. I do not show that we have a file for Lonestar.

 
Importance:	High

Diane, Tanya and Jay:

We have been requested in connection with an SEC subpoena to produce documents related to the referenced counterparties (including their parents, successors, subsidiaries, related corporations, partnerships or professional associations, affiliates, principals, officers, directors, general or limited partners, associates, employees, agents, and independent contractors).  We have checked our Lotus Notes database and don't have a record for either of these entities.

Will you let me know if your groups have had any dealings with these two entities or know of a business person who has done business with either of these entities?  We MUST respond to Enron Corp. Legal by noon Thursday (10/4).

Thanks!

Marie
