Diane:

I hate to bother you since you're busy, but will you sign one more original of each of the two Torch termination agreements for me?  Torch wants a copy with original signatures for their file, so in order for us to have an original with their signature, we need to have two originals signed.  When they're ready, if you'll call me, I'll send a clerk down to get them.

Thanks!

Marie
