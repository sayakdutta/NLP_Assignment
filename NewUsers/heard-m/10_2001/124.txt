Do you want me to take a first stab at these two agreements?


Cc: Heard, Marie


Please print and I need a file "ECI/CSFB brokerage agreement"




This is the primebroker agreement that we need to fill out for CSFB.  They are holding two trades hostage so this is a priority for us.  Please let me know if you require any further information.
