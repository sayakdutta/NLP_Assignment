Do you want to send it to Roeline or do you want me to?

 

Thanks Marie,  I have no issues with this letter.

Thanks,
Russell



 

Hi, Russell:

Attached for review is the draft of the proposed fee letter in connection with the Torch deals.  Let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Thanks!

Marie
