Diane, Tanya and Jay:

We have been requested in connection with an SEC subpoena to produce documents related to the referenced counterparties (including their parents, successors, subsidiaries, related corporations, partnerships or professional associations, affiliates, principals, officers, directors, general or limited partners, associates, employees, agents, and independent contractors).  We have checked our Lotus Notes database and don't have a record for either of these entities.

Will you let me know if your groups have had any dealings with these two entities or know of a business person who has done business with either of these entities?  We MUST respond to Enron Corp. Legal by noon Thursday (10/4).

Thanks!

Marie
