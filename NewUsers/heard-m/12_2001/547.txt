Hi, Mari:

I have prepared the separate phone list for each bidder room and am going to place five copies of each on the tables by the boxes in each room.

Let either Genia FitzGerald (x36389) or me (x33907) know if you need anything.  We will have our assistants bring coffee, etc., so if you will let us know when the groups arrive at the data room, we will take care of that.

Thanks!

Marie
