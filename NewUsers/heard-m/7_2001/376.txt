 

I just got a call from Rob Wheeler, one of our power dealmakers, quizzing me about 15 counterparties he was interested in the status of the masters/guaranties our group is working on.  What I found out was in situations where we are reviewing counterparty guaranties unassociated with a master or an confirmation, there is no record in Lotus Notes to tell us who is working on the guaranty so I was unable to tell him whether we had it, who was working on it or what the status was.  It didn't made us look very good.

I would suggest that in the future that we open an entry in Lotus Notes when we are reviewing counterparty incoming guaranties so we have a record of them.

As a note, the three guaranties Rob is VERY interested in are:  NYSEG Solutions (already being worked on in Legal per Credit), Energetix and Keyspan Corp. (Credit is not sure).

Thanks for your kind consideration!
