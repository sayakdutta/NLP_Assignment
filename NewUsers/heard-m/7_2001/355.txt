Brant:

Richard Friedman in Bill Berkeland's group would like to send a draft ISDA to Citgo Petroleum Corporation.  According to Lotus Notes, we sent them a draft in July, 1997.  Will you prepare a worksheet and send to us so that we can send Citgo a current draft?

If you aren't the right credit contact, will you pass this e-mail along?

Thanks!

Marie
