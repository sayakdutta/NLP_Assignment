We are in the process of cleaning this mess up. Sally Beck and Rogers Herndon are both given power of attorney to sign confirmations and they are both officers of ENA, so they can already sign documents.  Go figure!  If it's not too much trouble for you to verify those who should be removed then I can double check against my list.  I don't want to remove someone who should be left, nor do I want to leave someone on who should be removed.

Thanks for your help.

P.S.  For timing purposes, we are shooting for Monday to finalize documentation.

Marie,
I am also looking at the corporate workbook for ENA and who they list as Agent and Attorney-in-Fact.  I am not sure how accurate that info. is.  I see Jeff Harbert's name on there and we asked that he be removed earlier in the year.  I also see Mary Gosnell who is no longer with the company and also other people that used to be in the confirm group a long time ago but have moved on to other jobs.  Can you ask the person from corporate about this?

If need be, I can go through that list and submit a formal request to have those individuals rights removed.  Let  me know how we should proceed.  Thanks!

Kim

 

Thanks!

 

Marie,
I will send you the official update memo.  There are a few changes that need to be made for EIM's business.

Kim:

I have been asked by our corporate paralegal to assist him in cleaning up the ENA corporate database as those individuals who have been appointed agent and attorney-in-fact to sign confirmations in connection with financial transactions.  Mary Cook has a copy of an e-mail in the file to Brenda Herod setting forth the procedures and telling her that you verify the requests and notify Legal of any changes.  In this e-mail, apparently Brenda asked that Mike Moscoso's and Kristen Hanson's appointments be revoked and that Lisa McClendon be added.

Will you let me know of any changes that should be made at this time?

Thanks!

Marie
