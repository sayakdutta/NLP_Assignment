I'll see y'all at 11:30 unless I hear otherwise.

 

11:30?

 

Thursday works for me!

 

How about Thursday - I have a feeling there will be a great deal to discuss.

Either day works for me - how about you Jane?

 

Our group is going out for lunch today.  I'm free tomorrow and maybe Friday.

  Marie,

  Are you available to have lunch with Jane and I today?  If not, we can try again later in the week.
