I will get the amendment to you today.

Good Morning,
	For the below request, I have just received the amended guarantee from Cindy Richardson.  If you have the amended ISDA, I'd like to forward this to Russell Martinson.  
	Also, for Kona oil and gas properties draft ISDA, they want a draft ASAP for their legal to review.  If you can send the draft to me today I'll forward to the apporpriate party.  

Thanks,
Max

All,
	Per Jay Williams approval, Russell Martinson of ConAgra Energy Services has requested an increase in Enron's outgoing guarantee of ENA to $30million from $20million.  In return, Enron has requested amendment to the ISDA giving ENA a credit threshold of $25million, up from $12.5million.  There will be no change in ConAgra credit.  Please prepare the appropriate amendments of the guarantee and ISDA to forward to Russell.  I am working on getting the mailing address to forward these documents, and will send it to you all once I receive it.  Please coordinate so both amendments can be sent at the same time.  
	If you have any questions, don't hesitate to call either Jay or myself.  

Thanks,

Max Sonnonstine
