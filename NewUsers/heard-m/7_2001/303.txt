Hi, Aparna!

Please copy me on e-mails forwarding credit worksheets as I am responsible for assigning them to the paralegals.

Thanks!

For the rotation.

Jim,

I have reviewed the financials of Rand-Whitney and a revised ISDA worksheet was sent out to Legal on 5/22/2001. The credit provisions did not change except for the fact that the credit threshold was increased to $1.0 million. 

Stepanie,

Could you please have an ISDA drafted for Rand-Whitney based on the attached spreadsheet ? Thanks.
