We just received comments to our form from Goldman and here are the names they included (excluding UK):

J. Aron & Company
Goldman Sachs Capital Markets, L.P.

 

I really meant is anyone in credit working on them, but maybe carol can get those names...would you coordinate with her....similarly if someone has been assigned to J Aron, I would like getting the names of entities in the J Aron house to be a high priority.....even imperfect names would be better than no names..   thanks muchly   bng

 

Right now Goldman and J Aron is unassigned, but the Goldman lawyer will be speaking to Carol re their comments to the form master netting agreement, so probably Carol will be assigned to Goldman.

 

Is anyone working on Goldman and J Aron?

 

Barbara:

I have Williams (called Leslie and gave them to her).  Jay Williams in Credit is working on J.P. Morgan and Bill Bradford is working on Duke.  Leslie said she has already pulled Goldman and J. Aron.

It looks like we should have them soon.
