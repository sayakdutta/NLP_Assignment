Thanks!  Do we make the check out to you, Hooks Industrial?

Marie,

  I sent in your order to Robert Allen today.  I believe it is all in stock - so it shouldn't take too long.  Below are the charges for the fabric you have already received.  I should find out shipping costs for Robert Allen by the end of the week and will let you know.  Hope it all turns out great - I'd love to see it when its done!
