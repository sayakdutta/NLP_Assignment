Lech:

I will ask the attorneys to forward you their initial draft of the Master Netting Agreement and then to send you the final draft.

I will fax you a copy of the final BP Amoco agreement, together with the states of incorporation for each of the BP entities.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Are you planning to address Lech's request?  Or is he in need of details that somebody else at Cadwalader already has?

 

It might be easiest if you would send me the agreements related to the UCC
filings.  That way, I will have names, addresses, etc., in one place.
Thank you.
