Paul:

Pursuant to my voice mail, Elizabeth Sager is finalizing a Master Netting Agreement with AEP that is to be signed by ECTRIC, ECT Resources Limited, Enron Financial Energy Trading and Enron Coal Services Limited.  It appears that John Sherriff is an officer of three of the entities and Stuart Staley is a director of Enron Coal Services Limited.  Will you assist us in getting this document signed by initialling, if appropriate, and obtaining signatures and faxing a signed copy back to us at (713) 646-3490?

If you have any questions, please call either Elizabeth Sager at (713) 853-6349 or David Portz at (713) 853-9239.

Thanks for your help!
