It was put in the interoffice pouch, so who knows where it is!

 

Nope, I'm still hopeful it'll show up some time today.  Couriers come at all times of the day around here.  Were you able to put a trace on it or do you have a tracking number and maybe we can trace it from up here?

 

Hi, Sharon:

Did the BP Amoco Master Netting Agreement ever show up?
