Here is the information you requested:

Navajo Refining Company
c/o Holly Corporation
100 Crescent Court, Suite 1600
Dallas, Texas  75201-6927

Louis Dreyfus Energy Services L.P.

I don't know if Louis Dreyfus Corporation is the same as the Dreyfus Corporation.  Louis Dreyfus Corporation is located in Wilton, Connecticut.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Hi, Marie, hope all is well.  In order to complete our conflicts checks on
two counterparties, we need answers to the following questions:  (1)
Exactly which Navajo and Louis Dreyfus entities/subsidiaries will be
involved in the Master Netting Agreements?  (2) Is the Louis Dreyfus on
your list the same as the Dreyfus Corporation?  (3) What is the main
business address for Navajo?  Thanks and please call with any questions.

Best Regards,
Athena
