Hi, Dana:

We have received the original copy of the ISDA Master Agreement.  In looking through the supporting documents, we noted two outstanding items:

1.	We did not receive an original signed IRS Tax Form W-9 as required pursuant to Part 3(a); and

2.	The Certificate of Incumbency we received was not an original and was dated November 14, 2000.  We would like to receive an original certificate dated a current date.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact either Frank or me.  We look forward to receiving this documentation.

Marie
