My gosh that was quick!  Do you have ESP and knew I was going to ask you for this?

 

Marie, we do not have a signed Master with J. Aron.  Attached is the GTC we use for their transactions:

Sharon:

Does ECC have any physical gas masters with J. Aron & Company?  If not, can you send me a sample gtc used?

Thanks!

Marie
