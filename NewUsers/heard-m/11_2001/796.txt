Dana:

I faxed these to you this morning and the originals have already gone to Federal Express.  I will resend them to you now.

Hi Marie,

As I referenced in my earlier e mail, I am in the process of reviewing the
AHC-Enron originals.  However, I noticed that I have not yet received a
faxed set of Authorizations from Enron for this ISDA.  As referenced in your
cover letter, could you fax these to me at your earliest convenience?  If
acceptable, you can than forward a set through the mail.

Thanks so much,
