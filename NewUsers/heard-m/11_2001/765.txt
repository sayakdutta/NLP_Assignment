I guess we can go whenever.  It'll just mean we won't get as much done this weekend, but we don't have anything else going on.

Ramona,
	Let me check with my sister.  I would love to go, but don't know if
we can make the time.  She's probably at lunch right now, but I'll send her
this e-mail.

Thanks,  Anne
