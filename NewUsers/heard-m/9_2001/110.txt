FYI
 

Marie:

Pemex will by signing the guaranty, that will be either Juan Jos?
Suarez (CFO) or Jorge Lanz (Managing Director of Finance).  They will
be able to sign it once we get the final blessing from the Ministry of
Finance, they have to confirm that the guaranty does not represent
contingent public debt and therefore it does not require registration
with Hacienda.  We are checking everyday to make this happen as soon as
possible.
The guaranty cannot be dated as of January 1, 2001 as we got the
authorization from the Board in July this year, and we also need this
confirmatin from Hacienda to be prior to it?s execution.
As soon as we have it signed I will send you a fax, and the hard copy
will follow.

I will keep you posted,
Martha
