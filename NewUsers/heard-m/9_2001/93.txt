Thanks, Gordon.  I'll send them a letter asking for these items.

Thanks!

Marie

 

Marie, I don't believe so.  I checked TAGG, and noticed that I executed the deals for Nemak, S.A (and therefore, would have provided you with a copy of everthing other than straight ISDAs for the counterparties).  Please let me know if you need for me to contact them for this document.

Thanks,
Gordon

 

Gordon:

Have you received a W8BEN tax form and/or a legal opinion from Nemak?  They are supposed to deliver these to us in connection with the signed ISDA Master Agreement, but I haven't seen them and before I contact them, I thought I'd check just to make sure you didn't receive them.

Thanks!

Marie
