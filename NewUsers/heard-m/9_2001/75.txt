I am preparing the information on the Company Account Application and have a question regarding the address section.  I have completed the section regarding ECT Investment's "principal executive office" (Houston address) and would like to know how this differs, or if it differs, from the address of "registered office".  Would you explain the difference, if any?

Thank you.

Dear Sara

I am responding to you whilst Daniel Harris is out of the office.

In reference to Arbitration, we can agree to Arbitration in the English
Courts.

Daniel will contact you tomorrow in reference to the remaining points.

I look forward to receiving the outstanding documentation.

Kind regards

Daniel:

Thank you for your response.  Unfortunately, the outstanding issues
relating to the Terms of Business Letter impact our corporate policy.
If you insist upon arbitration, it should be at either party's option
and we can agree to arbitrate in accordance with the International
Chamber of Commerce Rules.  Also, as you mentioned below, there may be
non-prime brokerage issues that relate to the terms of business and,
therefore, are not adequately addressed in the terms of business letter.
We do have other business relationships with GSI and again request
inclusion of limitation of liability language in the terms of business
letter.  I propose:

"Neither party shall have any liability arising from this Letter or from
any obligations which relate to this Letter for any indirect, special,
punitive, exemplary, incidental or consequential loss or damage."

Please reconsider the foregoing with explanation.  I will be out of the
office 9/18/01 in the a.m.

All remaining documents have been completed and we will have them
executed together with the terms of business letter.

Regards.  Sara
