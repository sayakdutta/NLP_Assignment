We have credit sign off on all masters, amendments, assignments and terminations--any document where credit is involved.  We don't have them initial the day to day confirms, but if there is a confirm with a lot of credit terms which may have been negotiated, then we'll have them initial those.

Marie,

Can you tell me what the Swap Group has credit sign off on before sending out for execution.  Is it all agreements, amendments, confirms, etc.?  We will be duplicating your procedures.

Thanks,
Genia
