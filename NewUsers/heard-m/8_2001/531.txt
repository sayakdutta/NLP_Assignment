Kim:

Attached for your further handling are a clean and blacklined draft of the revised Schedule and Paragraph 13 for the City of Glendale.

We will try to verify the outside counsel to use in connection with rendering the legal opinion so that we can begin that process.  If we have any problems, it may have to wait until Sara Shackleton returns on 9/4 since she is more familiar with who we use and what the extent of the engagement will be.

Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else.
