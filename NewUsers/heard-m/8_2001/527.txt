Mr. Flett:

I am close to finishing the review of your draft Schedule to the ISDA Master Agreement and was hoping to receive your Paragraph 13 to the ISDA Credit Support Annex to review so that I can present them both to Sara Shackleton for final review upon her return from vacation on September 4.  If your Paragraph 13 is ready, please forward to me via e-mail at the address noted below.

Thank you for your assistance and, should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.
