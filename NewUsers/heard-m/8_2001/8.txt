I don't know what you told them, but it sure got them to respond.
 


Dear Lucy:

Our financial council considers that there should be no problem to
include your comments in the guaranty form, although it has to be
authorized by the corporate council.  We are currently working on that
authorization and will let you know as soon as we have an answer.

Best regards,
Martha Navarro
