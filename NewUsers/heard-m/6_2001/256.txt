I'm just now going through my e-mails from last week as I was out cleaning up after the flood.  I had given Cynthia the omnibus forms before I left, so I don't know what they are doing/not doing up there.

At what point was this discussed? I thought we were handling just like ENA.  Did you ever discuss with Cynthia or Molly?

 

I was looking for an Omnibus type doc which incorporates the same credit terms as the ISDA we draft we sent; why are we incorporating a document that has not been signed? I'd like to be consistent with how we manage financial transactions across the company.  Let's discuss. Thanks.

Michael - based on the new version of the deal ticket changing the volume and price slightly, I have added these changes to the form of confirmation that Cynthia had marked up last.  Please everyone review as Michael would like to send an executable copy tomorrow morning to RM.  Please advise.  Thanks!

I've updated the price and the volume.  Please send Imad and me the updated confirmation for execution tomorrow.

Please note that the confirm should contain the new language that Cynthia has added (Imad said that you were aware of this).  Please contact Imad if you have any additional questions.  Thanks.
