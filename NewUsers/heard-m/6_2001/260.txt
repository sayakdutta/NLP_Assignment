Tidewater Fibre has requested some changes on the contract.  They are as follows:

1) Under Terms and Conditions, want to provide financial statements annually vs. monthly.

2) Alternative Floating Price Structure:  We have included RISI as the back-up index should the OBM become discontinued.  Because their is a basis difference between RISI and OBM, we need to adjust the alternative floating price as RISI - $18.  RISI - $18 would replace DLK East - $10.  Thus there is an $8 difference between the two indices.

3) Under Annex B1, the would like for it to read "either party (ENA or Tidewater Fibre) faces default situation" instead of Tidwater Fibre Corporation

4) Under the collateral provision, instead of counterparty they would like "Tidewater Fibre and ENA"

If you would like to speak directly with the counterparty, I can arrange that.

Thanks

Erik
