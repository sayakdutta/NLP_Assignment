Hi, Bernice!

I don't think Legal needs to review your correspondence requesting this information, but we will still need to receive copies of the name changes, mergers, etc.

Thanks!

Hi Marie,

GCP at times sends correspondence to customers requesting documentation (Sec of State) that is needed for name changes, mergers, etc.  Does anyone in Legal need to review this format before we continue with our process.

Please advise.
