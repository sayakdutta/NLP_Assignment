A mere technicality!  Here is the revised Annex B.  Thanks for catching!

Marie/Brant,

The deal in question is booked to the legal name of Inergy Partners, LLC, not Inergy Partners, LTD.  Further, per Global Counterparty, there is no entity of Inergy Partners, LTD.  Can you amend the Annex B to reflect this name?

Thanks,
Joe
