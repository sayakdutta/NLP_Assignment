I think we both know the real truth

 

Not nasty.  Just truthful.  :)

 

you dont have to be nasty

 

you are a nut!  ok i'm sorry.  i admit it.  i am attracted to men who always have really red eyes and who talk bad about me behind computers!  how did you ever figure me out?

 

the first step to recovery is admitting it

 

oh shit you are saying that i have a crush on you?  i am finally catching on.  don't make me come down there and kick your butt!

 

just admit it

 

on yourself?


 

ok a crush

 

what's an infatuation?  you being a brat?  that will never pass

 

dont worry it is probably just an infatuation that will pass

 

that makes you an eve bigger brat.

 

I know

 

YOU ARE A BRAT!!!!

 

whatever, ok if thats what you want me to believe

 

quit flattering yourself.  it was a male looking at you and he told me!  how do you feel about that?

 

stop lying, you dont have to be embarrased, I understand

 

then i guess it is a fact that a male was staring at you.  



i am laughing so hard!!!! :)

 

I wasnt accusing you I was just stating a fact

 

i can't tell because then you would acuse them of staring at you too.  

 

no I dont know how it works, and who told you

 

don't you have messenger


 

nobody told you, dont lie

 

damn you caught me.  and for your information, i didn't notice it...someone told me about it!  so whatever to you mr. allergy man!!!

 

if you werent always staring at me you wouldnt notice my eyes
