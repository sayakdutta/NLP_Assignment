Sometimes it is great to be the old USA.  Jury's rule, wigged Lords drool.

Mike,  it is going to take a long time for the frustration to subside from 
this one.  It would be one thing to lose fair and square.  It was quite 
another to simply be "mugged"  (the word used by Jonathan Sumption).  Even 
worse, Pollack (your old friend) was overheard to say that it was a joke the 
way Enron got "stitched up".  Makes you feel a bit like you are in a kangaroo 
court.  One read of the opnion will bring tears to your eyes when they talk 
about "what the parties really intended" instead of what the contract says.  
The only route of appeal is to the Court of Human Rights (which right this 
minute I am feeling that mine have been violated) so it's a tough one.  
Anyway onward and upward to the broadband world (nothing's easy these days).  
Thank you for your words of comfort.  I must confess that in reality I am 
actually struggling to come to terms with this one (because we are right, of 
course), but in the end I must remember, this too shall pass.  Ciao.


   
	
	
		



Mary Nell,

I can't tell you how disturbed I was over this.  I can't imagine how you are 
feeling.  As I said in the voicemail it certainly is not a reflection on the 
teams efforts.  It speaks volumes about the UK and our independence!

No way to take this to the EU?
