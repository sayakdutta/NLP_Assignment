Louise,

You're very welcome.  It is always a pleasure to celebrate this blessed 
event.  This  is a truly special time in your life and I hope you and Marcus 
can relax and enjoy it.  This event will change your life and bring you true 
joy.  I remember the birth of our children like it was yesterday.  Simply 
writing this makes me feel great and my thoughts and prayers will be with you 
during this wonderful time.

Remember work will always be waiting for you;  this is what is truly 
important.

Sincerely,
Mike
