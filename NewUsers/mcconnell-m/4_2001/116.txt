Mr. Steimer -

Mike McConnell has been on several trips over the last few weeks and he has 
asked me to contact you on his behalf.  He asked me to pass along his 
sincerest apologies for not getting back to you on your invitation sooner.  
Due to his heavy travel schedule, he is unavailable to attend the Shell 
Houston Open.

However, Mike asked that I pass along to you my phone and e-mail information 
so that you may contact me to schedule the meeting to discuss LNG projects.  

713-853-6898.  Please feel free to contact me at your convenience.

Thank you.

Dear Mr. McConnell,

Bob Lewis and I would like to met with you to discuss Enron's developing
LNG projects, and how CB&I can assist with your efforts.

Bob is Senior VP Sales, and is CB&I's corporate sponsor for Enron.  I am
directly responsible for working with Enron on LNG projects.

As you may know, CB&I recently purchased the assets of PDM Engineered
Construction, who designed and constructed          the EcoElectrica LNG
Import Facility.  CB&I is currently constructing the AES regas terminal, in
the Dominican Republic, among other ongoing LNG projects.

CB&I is very interested in working with Enron on such projects, in
particular the Jose, Venezuela, and Bahamas projects, as well as others you
are considering.

Are you available to meet with us over lunch on Monday April 9?  Alternates
dates for us are Tuesday April 10 and Friday April 13.  Hopefully we can
get together with you on one of those dates.

Please advise your availability.

Thanks and regards,

Jeff Steimer
Vice President, LNG Sales
CB&I
