Sounds good.  I was in Norman this last week...recruiting, golf and KSU game (close).  I also picked up my tickets for this weekend.  I don't like thinking about the game, it makes me nervous but that is the fun of it.

By the way, can you tell me the line?  I'm sure you are favored.

This game is going to be incredible....I hope.  Both teams looked very good this last weekend.  I am catching a flight to Dallas Friday after lunch.  We should try and grab lunch or coffee sometime this week, just to get a little pregame atmosphere in the office.

GO HORNS!

Here we go!
