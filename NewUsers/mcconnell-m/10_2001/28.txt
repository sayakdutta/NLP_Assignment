Welcome Habitat Volunteers!=20

Our project starts on October 20, at 8 am.  Due to the overwhelming respons=
e from our church community, it will be necessary to schedule volunteers fo=
r particular Saturdays from October 20 through November 17. We want to give=
 as many people as possible the opportunity to participate without overcrow=
ding the building site.  If I have scheduled you for a date you are unavail=
able, please let me know; there are plenty of people to step in!  The sched=
ule for October 20 is attached.  Others will follow shortly.=20

Please plan on providing your own lunch on October 20.  We will provide dri=
nks, but you should bring water for yourself.=20

I have ordered tee shirts. If you want one, please advise me of your size, =
small through extra large, in writing or e-mail.  The price is $8.00, which=
 will just cover our cost.  The shirts are gray with the Habitat bent nail =
logo on the back and the St. Paul's logo on the front.  I will have them at=
 the site.=20

We will have hard hats at the site.  If you are scheduled to work and have =
indicated that you have power tools, please confirm to me that you will be =
able to bring those tools on your scheduled days.   =20

Noel Chang has volunteered to be the transportation coordinator.  He will p=
rovide or arrange transportation on a church van or bus on each of the Satu=
rdays.  I have given him your name if you identified yourself to me.  You c=


We need volunteers for several other key positions.  If you are qualified t=
o be a first aid/safety manager, or would like to organize food/water/bever=
age, daily registration, clean up or tool management, please let me know.=
