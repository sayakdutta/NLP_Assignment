Shanna,

What a deal.  When Jonathan and I talked, he did ask if this deal with Net 
Works was a problem.  I told him that I wouldn't imagine it would be an issue 
but to work it out with Eric and i gave him yours and Cindy's name rather 
than Robert.  Is this out of line with others at his level and responsiblity?

Mike



I have some real concerns over this contract Louise put together for 
Jonathan.  Shanna, can you check this out with Robert Jones.  I'd like to 
restructure this contract.

I have had some discussions with Jonathan and recommended he takes the LNG 
job offered.  Assuming he does, we have already set out the terms for him 
coming over (fully negotiated) so there is nothing to do on the HR side 
provided you are happy with the numbers.

Louise

ps Robert please send Jeff the Jonathan numbers.
