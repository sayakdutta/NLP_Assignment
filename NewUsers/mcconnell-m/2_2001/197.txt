This issue has been going back and forth so Eric asked me to send you an 
email to see if we can resolve this issue.  I have been told by Eric that 
ProCaribe is in EGM and Mariella continues to say that it is EGA.  I can find 
reasons for this to fit in either place yet I think it is important to settle 
this ASAP.  I currently report into both groups so it is in my interest to 
resolve any misunderstandings as soon as they arise.  I hope all is well.
