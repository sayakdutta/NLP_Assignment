Emilo,

Thanks for the information.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do.

I know that Neal Gerstandt just joined the company last week and will be 
working with you on project Jose.  You will find him to be a great guy and a 
person with excellent judgment and overall experience in the energy 
industry.  I have known and worked with Neal for over 10 years.  I think he 
will make a great addition to the team and help bring this deal home.... the 
largest deal at Enron.

Mike
