Allan,
Thanks, I'll add them to the list.  I would appreciate a self appraisal 
feedback form on yourself with your list of accomplishments to date.  (I know 
it is hard to put together when you've been here for as long as you have).

Mike,

I am sorry to hear that you are under the weather - please let me know if 
there is any support I can provide you.  On another topic - would you please 
add the following people to my list of reviewers (Robert Jones, Jay 
Fitzgerald, Steve Horn, Philipe Bibi, Louise Kitchen, Drew Ries, Ellen 
Fowler, Larry Isso, Fred Kelly).  I am afraid that my list was approved 
before I was able to add any of the above people.

Thanks

Allan Sommer
