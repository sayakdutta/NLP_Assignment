PB,

I just talked with Cindy Olsen about the project.  We need to assign someone 
in our group to be the technology lead.  I know we have people on it but we 
need to pick someone to be responsible and then  clarify that person's role.  
Please get back to me with the selection.

Thanks,
mike

Thanks for your feedback. Here's an updated version based on the feedback I 
have so far.   
Mary, Todd had a good point, we need to consider a broadband plug.  Thanks.
