Philippe,
I don't really understand this guys question.   I need to respond to him with 
something because I know his dad very well via JDF.  Ross Cooley was Rod 
Canions #2 guy at compaq for years.  Can you send me to the right person?
Thanks,
Mike

Michael,

Hello. I'm amazed we have not met through JDF -- my family has been very
involved for many years and my father, Ross Cooley  has gone on to do more
work for the International JDF group. Anyway, I'm asking for your
assistance. Can you please steer me to the individual(s) heading up
Continental's internet partner development for the different Enron
Companies?

My company, Bowstreet.com (http://bowstreet.com) provides an XML
infrastructure technology that solves the challenge of "embedding"
organization business processes inside partners sites -- allowing rapidly
integration as well as scaling of these relationships. Again, your guidance
is most appreciated..
