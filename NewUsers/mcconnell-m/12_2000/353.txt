Don,

Howdy,  Yes I am going to Miami.  How could i not go!  I still cant believe 
it actually.

Sorry I 've dropped the ball on setting up a meeting with your company.  I 
did talk with  Cindy Olson, HR - EVP and she would like to meet.  I just 
forgot after our last exchange.  Please send me back and email with your 
telephone number and I'll have Cathy Phillips my assistant set up a meeting. 

Thanks,
m








 Hi Mike, Hope all is well and hope that you were able to spend a
little time at home over the holidays.Congrats on the Sooners season, what
an exciting year with one big game to go. Are you going to Miami? Spoke with
Brenda last night and she said they had a great time at the big 12
championships and are planning to go to Miami for the National Championship
game. Sure wish my Horns were going, I guess we have to settle for another
sunny, San Diago. I here we are having Duck(OREGON) for dinner. Good luck in
Miami, I will be rooting for your Sooners (that's hard to say). Give me a
call when you get a chance so we can follow up on Enron and Nexstar
opportunities. Thank.  Hook-em, Don
