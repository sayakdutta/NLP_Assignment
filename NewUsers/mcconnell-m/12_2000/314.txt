Mike, Jeff and Eric,

With the recent change of the President of PDVSA and the already announced 
departure of the Minister of Energy and Mines in January, there has been a 
significant amount of noise in Venezuela with respect to export projects in 
general.  I believe it is critical for very senior Enron people to make a 
direct pitch to the President of the country as soon as we can arrange one.  
We need to let the President know directly the benefits of the project and 
the strong commitment of Enron to the development of the project.  We have 
alreday done this several times, but it is time to do it again.

I recommend a visit in early January of maybe Frevert or you Mike (maybe 
both). We can also use this visit to have meetings with the new President of 
PDVSA and, hopefully, if there is an official Minister appointed with the new 
Minister.  It is not easy to fit in the President's agenda, so please advise 
the course of action and tentative dates.

Thanks,

Emilio
