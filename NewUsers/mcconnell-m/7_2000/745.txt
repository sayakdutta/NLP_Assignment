My name is Eric Efron and I am an intern in the tax department for EES.  The 
reason I am emailing you is that I am related to Kathy Knott and she had told 
me that she knows you real well and she wanted me to meet you.  I know you 
have been busy and out of town recently, so I figured I would just email you 
to see when you were available so I could come say hello.  Let me know what 
is a good time when you have a chance.  My extension is 57058.


Eric
