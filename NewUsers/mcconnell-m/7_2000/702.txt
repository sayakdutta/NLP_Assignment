Mr.McConnell,

I wanted to touch basis with you regarding your laptop tune-up last week and 
any issues that you may have had over the weekend. If there were any dialup 
issues or if you have any questions regarding our dialup process (VPN) please 
let me know. 

FYI,
Per our discussion last Wednesday your Compaq M300 (standard Enron issue) has 
been ordered and I will let you know when it is ready for use. 

Thanks,
Joe
