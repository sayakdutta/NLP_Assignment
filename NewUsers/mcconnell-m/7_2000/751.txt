Rebecca, 
Ouch.  Thanks checking, sorry for being out of the loop.  I'll let Philippe 
know, although he should have already been aware of this.

Beth Perlman was elected a Corp. V.P. in February and Jenny Rub was elected 
in May.  Call me or Kelly Johnson if you have any questions.

Rebecca,

Philippe being the only other corp officer within the large technology 
organization has an enormous volume of contracts to sign.  A large bulk of 
the signatures that are required come from two areas;  Infrastructure and 
ENA.  I would like to have 2 current Vice Presidents within the business 
units made corp VPs:  Beth Pearlman and Jenny Rub.

Can we make this happen and when would it occur?

Thanks,
Mike
