Mike,

Pete Weidler, a friend of mine, recommended that I contact you feeling that
I may be able to help your group. Like you my background is not in
e-commerce. I was most recently President of an oil company operating in
Colombia. I am a manager in the classic sense, experienced in planning,
project valuation, economic analysis, contract negotiations and
acquisitions and divestitures. I am fluent in Spanish having grown up and
worked in Latin America my whole life. I bring a keen awareness of the
Latin culture and, what's more, a strong desire to continue working there.
Do do this I'm considering a career change and can imagine no better
company than Enron to make that change smoothly.

Pete and I both feel that Enron should have a good situation for a person
with my qualifications; unfortunately Pete's group is actually downsizing
and in no position to hire.

I appreciate your time. Best Regards.
