Please read the following message from Jeff Shankman:

Mike and I have spent the last few weeks meeting with the different business 
teams and would like to begin our staff/budget meetings.  We feel this will 
provide an opportunity to build our management team, to ensure long term 
viability of our business, and to establish new contacts and to present 
business ideas in a flexible manner.  

Our first meeting will be on Monday, September 18th, from 8:30 - 9:30 a.m. in 
video conference room EB 32C2.  Thank you.
