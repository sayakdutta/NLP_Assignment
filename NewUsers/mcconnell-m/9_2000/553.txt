Hi Darren -

I am responding for Mike.  If you still need to see him (and Shankman) please 
contact me so that I may schedule some time on his calendar next week.

Thanks.

Mike,

I am in London and will return on Wednesday to the office.  I am curious 
if you will have any time this week to fill us in on your discussions with 
Cargill.  

My schedule is generally free with the exception of Wednesday 
afternoon conference call with ConAgra.  For simplicity's sake,  I 
will be more than happy to coordinate with the rest of the ag team.

--Darren
