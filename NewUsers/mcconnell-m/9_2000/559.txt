We received your message, but Jeff and I are out of the office today and have 
not had a chance to review your document.  We will be back in touch when we 
return to the office.

Attached you will find the first draft of the B-plan for Europe.
Please give me feedback on it and I will finish it.



When it comets to limits for European Weather I would say that we within the 
next 6 to 12 months would need $3 million ( same as world wide weather today)
So we need to discuss this more before I type up the formal limit request 
letter.
