The next Enron Art Committee meeting will take place in the Enron Building
(exact conference room to follow) from 9:00 a.m.-11:00 a.m. on Friday,
September 29th.  At that time, the Caesar Pelli architects will review with
us key interior drawings for the new building.  I look forward to seeing
you there.
