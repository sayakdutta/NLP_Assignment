liz, I can't believe it - although he will never show!.   I would be happy to 
fill out a form when it comes out.  
Hope all is well.

Well, we finally got Greg Whalley enrolled in the "Executive Impact & 
Influence" seminar.  Each of you have been listed for feedback in the 
"peer/other" category.  It is crucial to Greg's success in the program that 
all feedback be submitted.  

I'll check back with you in a couple of weeks to make sure you are in receipt 
of the feedback forms.

Many Thanks,

Liz Taylor
