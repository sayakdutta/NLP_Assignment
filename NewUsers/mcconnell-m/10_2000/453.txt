Mike:

One of the things I wanted to discuss in our meeting was your advice on one 
of the CALME personnel for deployment, Antonio Jenkins Lara.

He is a very solid candidate that I'm confident can add great value in Enron.

Antonio has been a strong performer for us in his short stay with us.  He 
joined us around the middle of the year, so we did not have much data when we 
conducted our mid-year review.

He is an entrepreneur with strengths in logistics and systems.  He has both 
technical and commercial backgrounds.

During this year, he used is background in logistics and management to 
identify $1.8MM in recurring annual savings for Ventane, one of Enron's 
businesses in Venezuela.

I had initially placed him with Dan Reck because of Antonio's background in 
logistics.  However, it appears that Dan is more interested in bringing on 
people with a background in trading, which is not Antonio's strength.

I encourage you to closely examine his resume and I appreciate any good ideas.

I'm also looking forward to getting together with you soon.

Many thanks.  Shawn
