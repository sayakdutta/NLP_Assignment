Hi. I hope everything is going well at your end.

I would like to announce some good news. I have decided to get married at the 
year end on Saturday, 2nd December to be precise. 

The lucky or should it be foolhardy ladies name is Jaya. 

I would like to extend an invite to you and your family, a formal invite will 
follow in the post. 

I hope you are able to attend even if it means combining it with a business 
trip to this region. (December climate wise is the best time of year and the 
Taj Mahal is very romantic place and being one of the seven wonders of the 
world worth a visit).

Good wishes to your family.


Regards


Sunil
