Joe,

I enjoyed it as well.  We all have a lot to do and money to make!  I got a 
long voicemail back from K Lay on my message to him and he heard me on the 
ePower side.  He also said that he had heard similar concerns as well.  

Rick Bergseiker (LNG) will be calling you.  He left me a voicemail that he 
has been working with ePower quite a bit and has talked about 2 LNG 
facilities.  i told him to work with you.

Cheers,
mike
