Bob, 

 I just tried to contact you but rolled to your voicemail which told me that 
your mailbox was full and it wouldn't let me leave a message.  The operator 
then sent me into a Nuevo message that stated that the office was closed.  
Sorry for my late return call but I've been running at full speed since 6:45 
am.  

Please call when you get a chance.  Also let me know via voicemail if this is 
urgent.

Mike
