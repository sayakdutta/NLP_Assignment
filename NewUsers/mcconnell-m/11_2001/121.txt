Monday night and Tuesday?  Craig got a special deal to play golf for half price at a nice course in San Antonio.  I told him yes but I needed to check with you.  I moved our Hoffman meeting back to 5:00 on Tuesday.   I still am committed to play golf on Wednesday as well.  Let me know if this interferes with any plans or if you don't think you'll be seeing enough of me.

ps  I've left a message for Greg with the receptionist from his group.  I still don't know if he is here.
