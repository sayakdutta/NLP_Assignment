GO GET 'EM

 

I really can't believe things happened the way they did.  I thought everything was set for you guys to get another opportunity for the national championship.  I also thought the case for Roy Williams to win the Heisman would become really strong.  I didn't get to watch the OU-OSU game, but I received about 30 phone calls the last two minutes of the game.

I am excited that some breaks have gone our way, but it will be difficult to beat CU twice in one season.  Also, I am not sure that I want to ever play Miami after seeing them the last two weeks.

Don't be too upset, you guys are going to be tough next year and you are riding a two year win streak on us right now....(11-0 would sound a lot better than 10-1).

I'll be heading to Dallas early Saturday morning.  

Take care,
Zac
 


It just goes to show.... If you just keep winning, things usually work out.  Good luck at Texas Stadium.
