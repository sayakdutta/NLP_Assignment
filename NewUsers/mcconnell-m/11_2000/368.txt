John, 
You caught me.  I've been hit again with the bug, the 3rd time in November, 
and the combination of drugs has me wide awake.  I did promise Chris that I 
wouldn't run off to the office when this occurs but she didn't tell me I 
couldn't do a lot of emails from home! - there is always a catch!

Actually I'm back to bed to try again after this one.  

Hope all is well in merry old England.

Cheers,
Mike

John, I'm in.  She was outstanding.  If you don't want her, I'll take her!

I have a PRC conflict during the next execom meeting.  If i'm not there 
please feel free to pass on my strong support.

Cheers,
Mike
