June 10, 11 ,12 the Canadian Energy Research Institute will host a 
petrochemical industry conference in a mountain resort 60 miles from Calgary. 
Our steering committee (Dow Nova, Williams, Shell chemicals, Canadian Pacific 
Railway, BP) has suggested that we ask you to address delegates on Enron's 
leadership role in e-business. I am making initial contact to explore this 
possibility, and to ask if is possible for you to recommend an alternative 
person within Enron, as I have lately learned you have changed positions. 
This is a high level conference for industry decision makers, which will give 
you an idea for this presentation: not necessarily the IT approach, more of a 
business strategy approach. I look forward to hearing from? you.

Best Regards.
