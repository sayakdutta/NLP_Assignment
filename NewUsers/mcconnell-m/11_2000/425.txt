Eric,
I was examining EGM's businesses for 2001 and I wanted to ask you a question 
about your specific business.  As you examine your goals and objectives, I 
would like to know what you think I could do to help you accomplish your 
plan.  Please send me a return email with 3 specific items that I could do 
personally to add to your business.

Thanks,
Mike
