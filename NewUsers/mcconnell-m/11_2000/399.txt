Mike:

I enjoyed your remarks and meeting you after your speech.  I remain quite
interested in your comment that Enrononline expects to trade more coal that
natural gas or electricity in the future.

As we discussed, we are the dominant software fossil fuel developers in the
generating space, having our operating systems installed in 23 of the
largest generating companies.  The largest of our customers are also the
largest consumers of coal, and include TVA, Southern, AEP, First Energy,
CP&L, Exelon, New Century/Excel, and Southern Energy, among others.  At
several of the companies' request, we have developed our Fuel Optimizer
Module (FPO), which tells the fuel buyer what the delivered cost to a plant
specific specifications is, once the coal cost is factored into the
equation.

Attached is an overview of our system, and the specs on the FPO.  Please
forward these on the appropriate people in your organization.  I look
forward to hearing from them.

Thank you for your time.

David
