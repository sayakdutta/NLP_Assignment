Jim,

Thank you so much for all your help on this matter.  I know how difficult 
your job is day to day without items like this popping up.  I spoke with 
Carol Randall and Cindy Levi, the principal of the school, and they are so 
appreciative it is hard to describe it.  The school constantly talks about 
Enron and hundreds of children are using the donated computers and now 
printers.

Thanks again and have a good holiday.

Sincerely,
Mike McConnell



Thanks heaps for all you coordination on this, Jim.   Enjoy your turkey day, 
too!    JR
