Wade,

Thanks for the email and invitation.  You never know when I may show up!  I 
look forward to learning more about this and how our groups work together.  
Is John's group doing a good job for you?

Mike



Mike,

Congratulations on your new position with Enron Global Markets. Obviously, 
this is very exciting for you and for us. You probably took this job to get 
away from India, but actually John Nowlan's group serves as the fuel manager 
for liquid fuels (naphtha and distillate) on the Dabhol project.  So the 
standing invitation we issued to you when you visited us last still stands. 
Come over when your schedule allows. Marc de la Roche in your group has been 
threatening to get me out on one of the tankers during unloading while 
bucking in the monsoon tidal flow. Maybe you can join me.

Wade
