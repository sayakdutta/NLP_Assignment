Renee,

What a wonderful surprise to see you in the Enron Building today!  I thought 
you had left the Company.  Glad I was wrong.   I want to get caught up with 
what you've been up to since Park Street.   As I mentioned, maybe we can grab 
Mike and get some lunch next week.   Or if you and Mike have already shared 
recent histories you and I can go.  I have no plans next Wednesday, Thursday, 
or Friday.  Mike?
