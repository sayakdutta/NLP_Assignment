Greg and Maria,	

Attached is a first draft of the response to the protest filed by the CPUC. I'm also sending a copy to Steve Sojic and Frank Kelly. I thought we would get your feedback, as well as that of Steve and/or Frank, turn another draft, and then distribute it to the business people on Monday. There is absolutely no pride of authorship on my part, so please don't hesitate to comment. Also, given the relatively short amount of time that we have to file this, I haven't prepared all of the footnotes and citations yet.
