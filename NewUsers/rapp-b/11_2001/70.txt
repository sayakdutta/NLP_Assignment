	Denise, 

		Thank you very much. I just got off the phone with someone from technical services and I think (knock on wood) that the problem is solved. Thanks again!

 

I logged on as you from my computer and approved those 3 invoices for you.

I'll check with tech support on why you can't access it from your computer.
