Mark,

	This looks fine. 

 

Bill,

Attached is the confidentiality agreement that we are signing with Aquila.  It was originated out of our legal group but Aquila added:

	2. 	(iv)
	7.  	"for a period of two years."

I would like to use it for Reliant too.  Any problem with that?  Please let me know.

Mark
