Linda,

	This looks fine. I just want to confirm that we do not countersign this transportation service request when we receive it from the potential shipper. Instead, we process the request and generate a transportation agreement that we send to the shipper for execution. When we receive an executed transportation agreement from the shipper, we countersign it and begin service. Is this correct?

 

Bill, Teb,

Attached is an electronic version of the request for gas transportation form that we would like to implement for TW in the new contract system..  It is very similiar to FGT's.  Would you please review and let me know if this looks okay.

Thanks

Linda
