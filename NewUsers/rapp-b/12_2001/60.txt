Greg,

	I had a dental appointment this morning so I didn't get your message until after 8:30. Do you have some time today to talk about the status of TW's contracts with Enron Compressor Services? I think it will take about 15 minutes. I'm here all day. So, just about any time is good for me. Thanks.
