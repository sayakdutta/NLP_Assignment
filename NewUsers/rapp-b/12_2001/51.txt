I hope we are not planning on meeting for several hours. I have another meeting scheduled starting at 10:30. Also, where are we meeting?

 

	I have a 10:00 AM meeting. Please go ahead and meet, I do not have to be there the whole time and can come back after my 	other meeting.

I am available from 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. (but not after 11:00 a.m.) and after 2:00. 

 


I am available all day on Tuesday to discuss the above subject. We need to meet to discuss this issue from purely a ETS point of view. Please let me know your availability.

Thanks,

Paul
