Is Stephanie Miller the right person for this?  Can you forward this to the correct person?

Chris,
The owner of an underground gas storage facility called me today asking to contact a person in Enron regarding the possibility of leasing his storage. It is a depleted gas reservoir in Antioch, near the Sacramento River. It is connected to the Calpine system, but it is not connected to the PG&E system. Its capacity is six bcf and currently contains one bcf. It is surrounded by several hundred available acres if you wanted to consider building a power plant.  

If anyone in ENA might be interested in talking to this guy, could you please refer them to Ken Beebe whose phone is 925-837-9019. Thanks!
