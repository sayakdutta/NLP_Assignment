Houston has actually been nice - hasn't gone above 85 and it is great to sit outside at night.  Anyway, you work too much and need to think about getting a life!!  

We had the best intentions of going to Greasewood flats but were too lazy to drive there.  It was an awesome relaxing weekend and the weather was great!!  We hiked camelback on Saturday.

I will be coming back to PHX to visit Arizona Public Service soon.  don't know exactly when yet.  

Let me know when you feel the need to get away to some nice humid weather - it's good for the complexion, you know!!

Take care,

Kim 

 

It was 107 degrees here yesterday...but a dry heat. I wonder how that
compares to Houston Humidity?

This Friday, May 11, I have four new brokers coming over from the
competition, so I'm afraid my weekend will be spent at the office working
with them. Honestly, I'd rather be sweating in Houston and be at your party.

Did you make it to Greasewood Flats?
