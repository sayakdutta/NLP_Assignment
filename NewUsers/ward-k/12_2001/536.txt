I sent the spreadsheet and instructions to Megan Parker.  She should be putting it together for you.

Thanks,

Kim

ps.  I will be out until Jan. 14 except for checking in on the 28th and the 2nd.

 


Kim, 
Mara said you should be able to find your November Griffith worksheet to calculate our November costs.  Can you help me?  
Thanks,

Craig, 
I am no longer at Enron, so if you get in touch with Kim Ward, I'm sure that 
she will take care of everything for you. 
Thanks, 
Mara
