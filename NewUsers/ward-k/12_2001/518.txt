I faxed these documents to you earlier.  If you did not get them, please let me know.

Thanks,

Kim

Kim, John Cogan and  I had called asking for copies of three transaction agreements.  I had not  seen those yet so I wanted to send an e-mail clarifying which dates we are  looking for.  Could you please fax copies of the transaction agreements  dated: 3/11/99, 11/28/00 & 6/1/01 to me at fax number 520-779-5338.   Thanks very much for your help with this.
