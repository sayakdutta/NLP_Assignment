I will call when I leave - probobly 7 or a little after.  And I promise not to keep you up TOO late!

 

Cool.  I will go home and work out.  Want to call me when you are getting out of HH?

 

lunch will be hard - I could do dinner though.  Got a happy hour I must make an appearance at 6 but don't plan to stay long. 

 

Do you have time for a Bon Voyage lunch or dinner?
