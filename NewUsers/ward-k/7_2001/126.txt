The index prices are fine and may actually be lower.  I will check with my desk.  The fixed prices are only for one year.  Five year fixed price indications for Malin are $4.12 and for PG&E city Gate are $4.77.  Let me know if you need any thing else.


Thanks,

Kim 

 

	The term needs to be for five years.  Are the prices listed for one
year or five years?

	Rod,

	As we discussed, attached is a proposal detailing a structure that
might
	fit your natural gas needs.  Please give me a call regarding any
	questions you might have and I will be in touch once I hear from
credit.

	Thanks for your consideration,
