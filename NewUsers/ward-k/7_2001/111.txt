Suzanne had previous plans so I thought that I didn't confirm the reservation.  I will be in the Grenadine Islands on the 14th - what's the occasion?  I think we will try to come in August some time.  Will that be OK?

 

Thought you were coming in town last weekend as you did make a
reservation????

There will be a big party at my house on the 14th of July.
