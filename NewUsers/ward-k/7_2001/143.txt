What did you do in Rome????  you must have had Capt. Neil.  I understand that he is a big golfer.  when did you go?  I can do lunch - what time?




 

I did do the Windjammer on that exact boat/iten.  I am not a cruise guy, so WJ was the way to go.  I dived and/or played golf every day.  The captain and I played one day.  St. Martin and either Nevis or St. Kitts has a casino, St. Barts is my favorite island overall.  I was a FREE man....when in Rome....!

Got time for lunch?

 

Sounds like fun!  I just got back last night too.  It is a windjammer but someday, I want to get a bunch of people to charter 3 - 4 sailboats and do the same thing.  Did you go on a windjammer too?  Or did you just sail around since you lived down there?  I've gotten my pictures back but I am waiting to see pictures from the other people that went.  I was using diposable cameras since mine was broken.  I was so disappointed that I went out and bought a new one the minute I got back!

 

That is the exact itinerary I sailed.  Are you going on a windjammer or wind-something?  St. Barts is my favorite island.

I left Thursday for a wedding in Green Bay, and then Sunday the bride and groom and a bunch of others, went up to the bride's family cabin up in Northern Wisconsin.  It was great.  We canoed, fished, drank a lot of beer and listened to awesome guitarists jam around the campfire.    Got back at 11:30 last night.

I want to sell all of my belongings and move to the beach!  It was so awesome!!  I think I am going back in January to sail St. Martin, St. Barts, St. Kitts, and Nevis.  

Where did you go on your vacation and how was it?  when did you get back?
