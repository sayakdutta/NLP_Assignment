I can not mention how jealous I am about this trip - but here are some GREAT recommendations -

1)  Indian Springs in Calistoga, which is just on the north side of the wineries.  It has a spa and a huge mineral pool.  Also, the rooms are little bungalows.



You can't go wrong with either one.   Also, a restaurant that has been recommended to me is the Culinary Institute.  It is suppose to be awesome!!

The guys on the gas desk are going to cayman tomarrow - I am very jealous of that too.  Can you tell I need a break??

Let me know what you think of my suggestions -







i know i mentioned this the other night but i can't remember the answer.
where would you recommend staying in napa for 3 guys.   i would like to go
to sonoma mission inn but these guys have never been to nocal and want to go
to napa.  any suggestions?
