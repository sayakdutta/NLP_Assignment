Darla,

This is what I have been able to find so far regarding fixed prices for citizens for Feb:







Have they given you any information that you can compare this to?  Let me know if you have any questions and I will send you a spreadsheet with all fixed price deals I have done to date.  March and april should be final.  You can send me a monthly email when you are ready to do - say - mays invoice - and I will send you everything I have done with them.

Call me with questions -

Kim
