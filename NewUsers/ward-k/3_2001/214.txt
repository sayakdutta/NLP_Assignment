Bonnie,

Sorry I am just now getting back - I was out of the office Thurs & Fri.  What I am trying to determine is the rate that Long Beach wants to beat and what it is made up of - so I would say both transmission and commodity prices.  Let me know if you have any more questions -

Thanks,

Kim, just a clarification on the last question of your data request --

By historical retail rates vs. SoCal's rates, do you mean the
transmission rates or the commodity prices?
