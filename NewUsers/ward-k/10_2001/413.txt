I will be happy to cruise the mall with you - as long as we don't go on halloween! Have a great afternoon and I will see you later!

Absorutely.  WO Right after work unless I knock it out at lunch.  

Side note:  Sometime this weekend I want to go to the galleria and talk to a watch shop about changing out the face on my Heuer.  Will you cruise the mall with me?




Sounds good to me!  Just let me know what time.  You gonna work out?




I will take you to Carraba's tonight if you like.  100% of sales go to the fund.  PJH

Don't forget to go out to eat tonight!!! This is very cool - you can check the merchants that participate.  Most are pledging 100% of proceeds, some like Carrabba's are pledging 100% of sales - it's a fun, easy way to help out!
