Art, 

It looks like I won't be able to make it.  I have some meetings set up that I seem to be unable to re-arrange.  I really appreciate the invite though.  Maybe next time.  However, I am going to try to make it to Albuquerque before the end of the year.  I will let you know what my plans are.

Thanks again for the invitation.  Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner.

Kim

Thanks,

Art, 
The premium for a monthly, physical, at the money call for Cal 02, 5000/day 

$.49.  I hope this is helpful. Let me know if you have questions or need 
anything else.  I will call you tomarrow about the balloon fest. 
Thanks, 
Kim 
  

This is for physical gas for a monthly call at the money. 
The Balloon Fest schedule is Oct 10th (Wednesday evening) 
through noon Friday (Oct. 12th). 
Thanks,

Art, 
We can price this up for you but I have a couple of questions - 
1)  Is this physical or financial 
2)  Is is a daily call or monthly call 
3)  Would you like this priced at the money or $.50, $1.00 or more out of 
the money?  I other words, what do you want your cap to be? 
Thanks, 
Kim 
ps  What is the schedule for the baloon fest the 10th - 12th?  I'm trying 
to work around some meetings etc.

Kim, just for planning purposes, what would it cost to have a call option 
for year 2002 and for 3rd quarter of 2002 for 5,000 mmBtu's per day 
from the San Juan basin? 
Thanks 
Art Avalos
