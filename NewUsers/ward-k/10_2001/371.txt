oops - it's ksward63

 

It was the leg's fault.  yahoo says kward63 is invalid??

 

I hope it was not because of me. I slept fine.  (Maybe you need some physical therapy!)  Anyway - trying to plan trips out west.  It is such a pain - I hate trying to get it all together to make it worthwhile.  If you ever want to IM me, my id on yahoo is kward63.  I hope you have a good day!

 

 Buenos dias to you.  I have yahoo.   Leg hurts.  Did not sleep so well.  

 

Good Morning!  How's the leg?  Do you have instant messenger of some kind?
