Sounds good to me!  Just let me know what time.  You gonna work out?




I will take you to Carraba's tonight if you like.  100% of sales go to the fund.  PJH

Don't forget to go out to eat tonight!!! This is very cool - you can check the merchants that participate.  Most are pledging 100% of proceeds, some like Carrabba's are pledging 100% of sales - it's a fun, easy way to help out!
