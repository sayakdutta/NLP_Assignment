Jim,

Could you send an electronic version of the latest RFP you sent out?  I am having some people help me internally and an electronic version would be helpful.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

  Kim: I just wanted to touch base to see if you received the RFP. I am
trying to see who is interested
          in our gas service at this time for next September. Thanks.
      Jim
