Thanks, Beth.  Credit will review and I will let you know if he has any questions.  I think the next thing we were waiting on were your new contracts.  If you guys need anything   while we are waiting on those, please let me know!  Also, if we need to meet in person, once we get things rolling, we are available to come to Dallas.  

Thanks,

Kim
