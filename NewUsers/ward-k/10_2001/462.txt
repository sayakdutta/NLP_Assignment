We are pricing the calls up for you and will have them in the morning.  As for the comments on the contract, you can send them to me and I will put them in our lawyers hands.  Thanks so much for getting that document throught the system.  I will talk to you tomarrow.

Hi Kim, hope you're doing well.  Just received comments from our 
Lawyers for your Master Enfolio. Should I be speaking with you or 
someone else? 
Also, could you give me a quote of what a daily call for Q3 will be 
at the money for 5,000 mmBtu/day. 
Thanks, 
I really appreciate it.
