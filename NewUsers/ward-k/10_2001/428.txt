David,

I got a phone call from Summit energy, through whom I supply full requirements gas to Smurfit Stone Container Corporations plants in southern California.  Smurfit has a couple of plants in El Paso, Texas, on the Southern Union System, that Summit is looking to obtian bids for.  The contact at Summit is Jason Ramsey and his number is 502-429-3800.  Their load is about 100,000 MMBtu annually.  Is there someone at EES that would be interested in working on this transaction?  Let me know if EES is not interested and I will let Jason know.

Thanks,

Kim Ward
