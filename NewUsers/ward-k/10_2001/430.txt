Kelli,

Attached is a request from PNM for an indication for the price of a put for Q3 next year.  This is a physical option that is at the money.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim

 


Hi Kim, 
Could you please give me an estimate for Q3 2002, on the cost of a put 
option for 5,000 mmBtu/day (daily and monthly) from the San Juan Basin. 
Thanks, I really appreciate it.
