J.,  Sorry, I sent the other email before I got this one.  The contact that I would recommend at NCPA is Dean Park, 916-781-4224.  He will either help you or can direct you to someone else.  You can reference the RFP if you would like.

You are right, NCPA is a consorsium of Munis.  The ones that would be involved in this particular transaction would be the Cities of Roseville, Lodi, Lompoc, and Alameda.
The transaction would be a physical basis transaction for 5000/day at city gate for 2002-2004.  We would be buying back $3.37 Physical BASIS for 2002.  This would be a sort of blend and extend.

Our deal would be Physical Basis.

Let me know if you have any more questions.

Thanks,

Kim

 

Kim -

Do you have a contact at NCPA that I could call to discuss credit issues?  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think NCPA is simply an operating agency for numerous California communities' utilities, and I need to investigate how obligations flow from NCPA to the member municipalities.

Also, is the deal that you are considering with them a financial or physical deal?


Thanks,

JRW
