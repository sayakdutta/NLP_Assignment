Jeff,

Got your message this morning and we have refreshed the blend and extent price for you.  For 2040 MMbtu/day at the PG&E City Gate for January, 2002 through December 2005, the blend and extend price is $5.205.  Nymex for the outer years has been moving up since last week, therefore, the little increase in price.  Let me know if there is anything else you need -

Thanks,

Kim
