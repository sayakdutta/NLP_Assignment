I will try to show up - since it is right down the street from my house!  Looking forward to it!

Once again, I will be visiting Houston for a brief time.  If for some reason
you have not completely forgotten me, I will be flying in tomorrow night
(Thurs) and going directly to Downing Street/Taco Milagro so that I can hang
with you for a drink (I will get there b/w 9:30pm and 10pm).  Would love to
catch up with you, see how you are and what life is like at a Fortune 7
company.

Hope all is well!
