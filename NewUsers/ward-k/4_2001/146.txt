Monica,

Attached is the previous draft contract with Grants latest wording inserted.  If you guys are agreeable, please accept the red-line changes, print 2 originals, sign, and forward to me for final execution.  I hope this is what you guys were expecting.  Please let me know if it is not so I can get with Dan. 

Thanks for your help!

Kim
