That would be cool - I get in at 5:59 pm on United from San Jose.  So how was napa?  I think that I need a napa trip sometime this year.  How was the place you stayed and where did you eat.  Did you buy any good wines?  What was your favorite?







if you want i can just pick you up at the airport and take you to dinner
from there, i have to go right by the airport on my way to santa monica.  i
think my teeth are still purple from all the wine i drank this
weekend.........





what is the closest airport to ivy on the shore?  and what is a good hotel?






cc:


i forgot i have a broker from bloomberg in town the same night so if it's
cool with you then dinner is on him.  i'm going to make reservations for 3
at ivy on the shore.....





What is the next closest airport.  No direct flights from San Jose.  I
think dinner at Ivy on the Shore is in order.  I will tell me boss Barry he
is out of luck and on his own!
