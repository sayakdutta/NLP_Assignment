Where is Moab - the place where you burn your feet?  Barry is in Canada - for his grandmother' funeral.  Went out with him - too forward and outspoken for me - at least for a first date!!  And you thought I had a strong personality!!!  Going to Palo Alto Thursday - hope to get a management services deal.

Just got in from Moab.  Is Barry in today?  Was that guy that you had the bad date with the one that told you "call me within 24hrs or lose my card?"
I was thinking about that guy after we talked, I hope he was joking or else he is a major loser!!!
