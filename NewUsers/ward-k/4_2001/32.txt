what is the closest airport to ivy on the shore?  and what is a good hotel?







i forgot i have a broker from bloomberg in town the same night so if it's
cool with you then dinner is on him.  i'm going to make reservations for 3
at ivy on the shore.....





What is the next closest airport.  No direct flights from San Jose.  I
think dinner at Ivy on the Shore is in order.  I will tell me boss Barry he
is out of luck and on his own!
