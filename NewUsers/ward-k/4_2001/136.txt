Chris,

I didn't make that many changes and I didn't change the ENA profit section.  Let me know if you have any questions.  I will be on my cell phone after 4:00 p.m. here - going to opening day at Enron Field!!  

Here it is - and I will have a copy and be able to discuss with you when you are ready.  Most of the desk is gone.

Thanks,

Kim
