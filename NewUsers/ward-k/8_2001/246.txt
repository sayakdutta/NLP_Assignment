Ann,

Would you be able to meet this afternoon (2:00) with my self and Janine Cashin to discuss the first Palo Alto invoice and what is in the system for July?  It shouldn't take very long - maybe 15-20 minutes.  Please let me know

Thanks,

Kim

 

Kim -
I looked over the spreadsheet and I am available this afternoon around 2:00 PM and tomorrow afternoon.  Please let me know when you are available.  You may want to include Patti and/or Ann when we meet since they would drive any Sitara changes that will have to be made.

 

Janine,

Attached is a new spreadsheet detailing what Palo Alto's July invoice should include.  However, I would like to get together with you again to go over the information that you have and have some of the volumes in the system corrected.  Please give me a call when you are ready to work on this invoice and we can get together then.  I am available for the rest of the week.

Thanks,

Kim
