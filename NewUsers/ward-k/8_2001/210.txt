Christopher J -

We missed you for sure!  It was a fun time.  I was glad to see everyone.  Nothing exciting took place - just a little dancing and visiting.  All went home at midnight.  Boy have we become boring in our old age!

Take care and keep in touch!

Kim,  how was Sat. night?  I didn't get finished at the Redbirds game until
10:30.  I couldn't have showered, changed and arrived before 11:45.  Didn't
think there was much of a chance anything was still going on at that time.
Hope all went well.  Bring me up to speed as to what went on.  Look forward
to hearing from you.
