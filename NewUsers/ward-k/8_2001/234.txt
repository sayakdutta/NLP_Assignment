Sure enough, natural gas rallied over 20% the  following week. This may be no more than a short covering rally, as double  bottomsare always to be viewed with suspiciously. Thus far, in the month of  August, natural gas has taken out both the July lows and the July highs forming  an outside bar on the month. Will need to monitor the 2nd  qtr close of 2001closely to gauge whether the July and August double bottom  is going to hold or not. At the very least, the double bottom makes a   fantastic momentum low, if not the actual intermediate bear market price  low.
