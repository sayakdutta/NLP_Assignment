How is 10:30 am Wednesday, 8/29?  I am having jessica reserve a room and once I get your confirmations, I will forward the room location to you.

Thanks,

Kim

 

I am available all day on Wed.  I am still chasing down the people I have questions for.

J. & Stacy,

Barry would like to set up a meeting to discuss CDWR from both a Credit and Legal standpoint before he goes to see them on Thursday.  Please let me know when you are available and I will set up the meeting.

Thanks,

Kim
