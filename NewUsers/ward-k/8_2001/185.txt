Trader says to just use the mid curves.  Let me know if you need anything else.

Thanks,

I'm working on a toll for S. Rosman; could you provide a bid adjuster (I'm using yesterday's mid curves) for PG&E CityGate for 2 deals. Both start 6/1/02; one is for 1 year and the other is for 15 years....so ending 5/31/03 and 5/31/17. Thanks
