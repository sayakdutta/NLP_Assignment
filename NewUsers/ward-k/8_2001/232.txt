Steve,
 
Let me know if you have any questions - I can get the lawyer on the phone.  Also, once I get that master, I will pass it on to you.
 
thanks,
 
Kim

Attached is a revised form of Collateral Assignment (this version provides Enron with a security interest in the marketer's Gas Purchase Agreement with the generator, and is marked to show changes from the last version that the marketer reviewed), as well as a draft of the consent to assignment that we would ask the generator to sign.  Kim, you can send these on to your customer for their review if you wish, but you might want to add the caveat that the credit group has not yet reviewed them.
