I guess we need to talk about September. We need to roll the deal or I need to remove them from my socal pool by Tuesday.  What are you guys thinking?

 


We went back and forth so many times, I can't remember who  last called who.  I am going on vacation tomorrow and the next  day.  Can we talk about SSCC on Monday?  Would that be  okay?
