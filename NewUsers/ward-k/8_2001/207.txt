Ann will be calling you today and will set this deal up for you.  I am assuming this is for the June payment.

Kim

 

I called her earlier this week and haven't heard back from her.  I guess you could probably talk more sensibly about it , so if you'd call her that'd be great. Just let me know the outcome.

Thanks!

 

I don't know - maybe we should talk to Ann Bike.  I guess it should go in as an annuity.  Would you like for me to talk to Ann?

 

Hey Kim,

I need to see about getting the fee due to John Cogan entered in Sitara.  Should I contact Kim Olinger on this?  Please let me know ASAP

Thanks
Darla
