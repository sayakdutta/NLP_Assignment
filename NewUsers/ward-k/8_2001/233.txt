Larry,
	Yesterday I noticed a small collar executed with the above entity.  We have no legal documents with this CP so would like to send out credit in the confirm.  There is little exposure to this CP, but I'd still like to cover the bases.  Please advise if this is ok with you.  

Thanks,
Max Sonnonstine
