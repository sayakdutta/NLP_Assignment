Karla,

We are printing the confirms and signing them this morning and will fax them to you soon after.  If a faxed signed copy is not ok, please let me know and we will send you originals overnight.

Thanks,

Kim

Tahnsk you for sending the needed confirmations.  I am told by my risk
manager, that I need an Enron signature on each confirm.  Please resend  the
confirms for gas post the Transaction Agreement with an Enron signature.
Thanks.
