Stacy,

I just extended a deal with the City of Pasadena for September.  The previous deal was for April thru August and the confirm was prepared by Dan Hyvl.  Could you help me prepare the confirm for the extension?  The term sheet is attached as there are minor changes.  Please let me know if you have any questions or if you are unable to work on this for me.

Thanks,

Kim
