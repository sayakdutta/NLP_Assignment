I have added Socal to the worksheet.  The prices listed are as of last night.  Nymex is up $.04 - $.05.  Basis is pretty much the same.  Let me know if you need anything else and I will let you guys know as soon as I get the option information.

thanks,

Kim

 

 

Kim,

Do you have any price indicators for CA Border (Topock) gas?  Thanks.  Larry





Hi guys,

I have been working on some pricing information for you guys and have
attached the fixed prices after today's close for Nymex, Aeco, San Juan,
and Permian as we discussed.  The guys on our structuring desk are
pricing up calls and puts for the same delivery points for August thru
March and August thru July, 2002.  The Nymex was crushed today, about
$.13 down for the year strip.  The balance of 2001 was down almost $.20.
The balance of 2001 is up about $.015 on access.  The socal basis fell
significantly today as well.

Let me know if there is anything else you need.  Jack, I will send you
the storage info I have asap.  Had trouble accessing it today for some
reason.  I will send the option pricing as soon as I get it.

Thanks,

Kim
