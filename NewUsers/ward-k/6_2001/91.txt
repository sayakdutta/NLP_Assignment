I got your message and your email - sorry about the phones.  I will just blame it on the flood!!  Looking forward to Wednesday morning.

Thanks,

Kim

	I just spoke with Larry.  We are on for the above mentioned meeting.
I tried to call you several times, but for some reason you couldn't hear me.
You answered once and your office answered 3 times.  It seemed that you and
your office could not hear me.  I tested my phone on a local number and it
worked.
