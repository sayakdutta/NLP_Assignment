Hey,

What's been going on?  Hopefully something besides work!  Finally getting moved in - well - almost.  Still have the junk room!  Went to mexico for a few days and it rained the entire time, which wasn't much fun.  Hoefully my next trip will be better!   anyway, it looks like I will be in Phoenix June 28 - 29.  If you are around, I would love to get together!

Hope all is well -

K.
