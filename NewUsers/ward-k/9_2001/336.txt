Jay,

We have been short listed on an rfp for Noresco, a power plant developer.  Attached are the financial statement for the parent who is willing to guarantee the project.  They plan to refresh prices and perhaps transact this week.  they have received contracts from other potential suppliers already.  I got the RFP late and therefore, I am running behind.  I am attaching my proposal in case you need it.  It will basically be a full requirements transaction out of our Socal Pool for up to 20 years.

CAN WE MAKE THIS OUR NUMBER 1 PRIORITY AND GET CONTRACTS TO THEM TODAY??  PLEASE?  I WILL SUPPLY BEVERAGES LATER IN THE WEEK OR PERHAPS A TICKET TO ASTROS TONIGHT (if I can find them!)  

Please call and let me know if we can make this hurdle!

thanks,

Kim
