Are you going to send the letter our or email it or do I need to do anything?

thanks for your help,

Kim

 

Kim, 
Unfortunately, all of the provisions I put in my letter are needed.  I did not put in any "nice to have but not needed"  provisions.

Stacy,

This looks good to me.  Are there any of these issues that we would be flexible on?

Thanks for your help,

Kim

 

Kim, 
Please review the letter and let me know what you think.
