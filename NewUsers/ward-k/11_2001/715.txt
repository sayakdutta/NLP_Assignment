I am in for sure.  Just gotta look into possibly using miles.  I think Suz might be in as well.  What about Rosie?  Let me now the details!
Thanks for the invite -

My folks have offered to let us use Chez Stinson for the weekend od Dec 15-16. Do you think you guys can motivate a Houston group to the Bay Area for a few days?
