Well they just cancelled my B-737 training that I was scheduled for on
Thanksgiving. Had started class last Sunday but suddenly they cancelled DFW
737 base flying. Thought it might be a little late to schedule our
Thanksgiving for the homeless strays.  Let me know a head count if we need
to do this.  Looks like I am one of the strays this year!

Schilke, are you doing Thanksgiving for the "homeless" this year?

Pookie and eating lunch at her parents' house, but were going to go by your
place after, if you  are doing the "homeless"  thing.

Will
