Art, 
An at the money Daily call option (against first of the month index) for 
gas at San Juan is $.24 for Q3 next year.  At the money monthly call 
options would be $.58 with a strike of $3.10.  A fixed price daily call 
option would be $.60 with a strike of $3.10. 
Let me know if you have any questions. 
Thanks, 
Kim 
  
Hi Kim, hope you're doing well.  Just received comments from our 
Lawyers for your Master Enfolio. Should I be speaking with you or 
someone else? 
Also, could you give me a quote of what a daily call for Q3 will be 
at the money for 5,000 mmBtu/day. 
Thanks, 
I really appreciate it.
