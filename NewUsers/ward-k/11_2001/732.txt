I think I might show up - was going to work out here but it will be less crowded there.  See you there

 

i'm working out w/ perky at tline around 530 today if you're interested.

 

I threw most of mine away - now I will munch on chocolate all afternoon.  At least it tastes better!


 

isnt that pasta yummy and nutricious?
