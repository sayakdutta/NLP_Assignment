Please reconfirm as necessary. These were all riding on contracts that have 
been "assigned" to AEP/HPL/Lodisco effective 6/1/01. ENA is no longer party 
to the original agreements. Please note that several of these are EOL 
transactions.

Thank you!

PS, Accounting was not copied on this message as there is no accounting 
impact on the contract # changes (all deals moved have production beginning 
6/1/01 (no additional production was finalized or cleared on these 
transactions under the prior agreement).
