Randy,

Attached is a clean version and a redlined version of the above-referenced 
document which incorporates the changes that we discussed with the exception 
of the end of Section 4.2, Section 4.5 and Section 4.6.  That language was 
added based on what our credit department wants.  Please review and call me 
with any comments (713) 853-5705.

Thanks, 

Stacy
