Daniel,

I found a GISB between Morgan Stanley Capital Group Inc. and Enron North 
America Corp. dated  July 1, 1998 in our files.  ENA received the contract 
from an assignment from Columbia Energy Marketing Corporation.  Why do we 
need to negotiate and execute another GISB agreement?

Dear Stacy,

As discussed, please find attached a draft form of GISB and Special
Provisions.  I understand that Jeff Hodge will be out of the office next
week.

If either you or Jeff have any questions, or if I may be of further
assistance, feel free to contact me at your convenience.

Kind Regards,
Dan
