Brad,
I spoke to Evans King today.  I will work on resolving this with him.  Should 
he or his client call you refer them to me.  They don't need to bother you 
about this.

Stacy: Friday I got a call from Evan King (Attorney for B & J Gas and Oil) 
regarding a payment. They think that index is the price and we have proof 
that the price was fixed. Proof that the price was fixed is included in the 
email Jim Javins sent me. Please review and get with the attorney to help 
resolve the dispute  (Evan King 304 624 8000). If you have any questions 
please call me at ext 37699. Thanks, Brad

Brad:

I got your message late Friday.  The B & J Gas and Oil deal was done on 

2001).  The confirmation was sent in care of Bowie, Inc., another of our 
customers from whom he had purchased this production, and who received his 
revenue and did his distributions at the time.  I got another copy from Stacy 
Dickson, ENA attorney, last week and faxed it to Bowie to review with Cawthon.

This was not paid correctly by the payables department, and was paid at the 
index instead of the fixed price.  We sent the deal ticket to Wade Price the 
day the deal was done, but it was not paid correctly.  This causes these 
kinds of problems.

I am attaching some notes from my phone log where I had discussions with B & 
J (Cawthon) and Bowie at the time I locked him in, as well as conversations 
later in March when he said he had not received his confirmation (it was sent 
again).  Call me if you need anything further.

Jim
