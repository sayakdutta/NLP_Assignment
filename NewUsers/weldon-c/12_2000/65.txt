We've got a 2-deep OL lineup for next year but I question the quality as only 
a few were legit blue-chips and I like the odds of getting bluechips versus 
sleepers.  I think we'll get one of the 2 studs and maybe both.  The main 
concern is that our primary weakness in the past few years has been a lack of 
dominate line play.  We've got the skill guys, DB's and LB's.
