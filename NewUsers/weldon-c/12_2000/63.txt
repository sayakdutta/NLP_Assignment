In the case of the Texas Society Ball, it would be cheaper to join for $20 
and buy the tickets for $125.   This does sound like a good one to go to 
based on the Website but sounds like we are out of luck there.  I imagine 
(hope) that the other balls are comparable.

I found several airline quotes for ~$250 as you indicated.
