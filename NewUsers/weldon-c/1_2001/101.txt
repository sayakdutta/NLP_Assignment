I believe that I inadvertently added the trading calendar request to my other 
e-requests.  You may consider my request withdrawn.

Thanks,

Good morning Ms. Adams,

Please see the note below from Iris Meunier regarding the Gas & Power Trading 
Calendar.  Please advise of the following three questions:
would you like to take ownership of the Calendar;
should the Calendar still be in use; and
can V. Charles Weldon be given access to the Calendar.

We thank you for your time and assistance.

Have a nice day,

Hi everyone, and sorry for the delays all this is causing...

The G&P calendar has not been used for months (ie.:  at least for the past 2 
years...!).  I would not foresee any inconvenience with anyone using it.
The request originally came almost 3 years ago from when I was working in 
London (for the Gas & Power Trading groups).  Since then, I have moved to the 
Madrid office and Lauren Urquhart has replaced me (with ext. 7359).

I would suggest you maybe get in touch with Rachel Adams and see if she would 
like to become the new "owner" of this calendar (if she sees any current 
benefit in still having one), considering her important role on the trading 
floor in London.  

You can go ahead and erase my name from the owner list once you have a new 
one.

Best regards,
Iris
