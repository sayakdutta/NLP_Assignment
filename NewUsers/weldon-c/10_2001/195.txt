thanks.  Soundlike we're OK.  I will need to get access to the global trading directory to post P&L sheet.  I'll submint an e-request

 

Charlie,

Please start saving your files out to o, global_trading, finacial_trading, texas trading. I can get to that and reconcile our p&l's.

Our variation from last nights physical part of the p&l is really about $597 when you factor in the the mirant new deal valued at -$2025. We valued the texoma true up $340 different, leading me to believe we have a little diff. in starting positions. I am requesting access to all the global trading files so I can see what you are using for the position. The remaining variance is due to an imbalance on both Katy and Texoma for the 1st (Katy 10,000, Texoma -10,000). Collectively, you are balanced but do have 1/day of risk at each location, which amounted to $200. 

So, we are pretty close on the p&l. I just need to verify your starting positions to confirm/reconcile our true-ups.

Pat
