Charlie,

Can you do me a favor?  I heard that one of my room mates from my summer in
Alaska works for ENE.  Can you look up his number for me?  I want to get in
touch with him, since I haven't talked with him in over seven years.

His name is John House, and he has a dual ME/Petroleum Engineering undergrad
from A&M and he has an MBA from UT.

Thanks,
Scott
