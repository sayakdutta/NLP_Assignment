We enjoyed ourselves and are glad that we were able to visit.  We're looking forward to you coming to our house in a few weeks

Love,

Charlie









Charlie,  I just wanted to say thanks for coming down to watch the kids
even though both of the games were cancelled.  It meant a lot that
you'll made the attempt.  We really enjoyed having you and I hope we can
continue to get together on a more regular basis without the rest of the
world with us.  It is nice for Melissa and I to have time to visit and
it is nice for the kids to get to know each other and to have a
relationship.  I am going to teach Blake how to wrap his legs around my
waist when I carry him - I am looking forward to the birth of my
nephew.  Love, Margaret
