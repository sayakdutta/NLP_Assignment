Our "spec" is <.05 ppm.  I talked to Doug about whether or not the measurement can be made to a greater degree of accuracy.  We believe it is not but Doug said he would provide us with a contact to call concerning the vanadium measurement accuracy.  I'm still waiting on that contact name and number.  The thought here was to have this contact discuss the iissue first-hand with the engineering team so a judgement can be made.

Thanks,

Charlie




Saybolt test result for low sulfur #2 vanadium is less than 0.1ppm using ASTM D-3605. Give me your fax number and I can send you a copy.

Doug,

This note is just to confirm my voicemail message this morning  indicating that the charges for the Fuel Oil sample check for vanadium should be charged to Co# 0413, RC # 106230.  According to the spec sheet I have, the ASTM method for vanadium is D3605 and the units of measurement are ppm (wt).

Again, I appreciate your patience in this frustrating issue.


Charlie
