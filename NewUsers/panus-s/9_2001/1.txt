Francisco,
While you are in Mexico, can you check on the below bolded documents?  Also, Barbara is supposed to have a copy of the corporate documents for Grupo Minsa for me.  Maybe you could pick these up?

Thanks.

Agustin,
We received your fax of the signature pages for the ISDA Master between ENA and Galvak.  Can you forward to me the original pages, as well as the corporate documents, legal opinion, tax form, etc. that are also required so that we may complete the file?

Also, we have still never received the legal opinion and tax form from Sanitarios Azteca and Lamosa Revestimientos or the corporate documentation from Grupo Kimex.  Can you check on these?

Thanks,
