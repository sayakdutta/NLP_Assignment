Attached is everything that you would want to know about our customer outing
this week.  If anyone has any problems with hotel rooms or anything else,
let me know.  Those of you that are coming in on Thursday, please make sure
that you have told the Sheraton on Highway 280 so they will hold your room
for Thursday night.  Please pass this information along to your co-workers
that are coming because I did not have everyone's e-mail.  The golf course
is over an hour away from the golf course that we are playing at so allow
plenty of time to return for those of you that are returning home Thursday
evening.  We will understand if you have to leave early but we should be
O.K.
