Country Doctor

An old country doctor went deep into the woods to  deliver a
baby. The cabin was so remote that it had no electricity.
Upon  arriving, the doctor realized that the laboring mother
and her five-year-old  child were the only people there.
With no one else to help him, the doctor  finally instructed
the child to hold a lantern so he could see to deliver  the
baby.
The child was happy to help, and held the lantern high
while  the mother pushed. After a little while, the baby was
born, and the doctor  held the newborn by the feet and
spanked him on the bottom to get him to take  his first
breath.
With the excitement over, the doctor asked  the
five-year-old for an opinion about the baby.

"Hit him again," the  five-year-old said. "He shouldn't have
crawled up there in the first  place!"
