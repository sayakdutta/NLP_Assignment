SERC

A very quiet night in SERC.  Evening peak prices fell off hard due to rain 
covering  SOCO's control area.  OPC was the best bid for the evening peak he 
21-22($60-$70).  SOCO would not show a bid for the evening peak.  For he 
21-23 SOCO began to sell about 400mw's to SCEG, SC and GTC.  The TLR called 
by TVA on the Bowen-Sequoyah has not been re-called as of 3:00 a.m.  TVA has 
not been able to bring in power from the north.   TVA must be doing well 
generation wise since they did not import power from its neighbors.  For 

SCEG will be on the bid.

FRCC

Importing power into Florida was again a problem up until off-peak.  For the 
evening peak FPL and FPC were bidding in the mid 40's.  For he 22 FPL bought 
$21 and for off-peak  FPL was a mid teens bid.   Both TEC and TAL were flat 
for the evening peak and the off-peak.   With TLR's expected again for 
friday, the night guys at FPC and FPL are going to let the day guys make a 
decision on any b.o.d preschedules.
