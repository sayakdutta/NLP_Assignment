We should be checking trans. into Florida on a nightly basis.  You should look at the JEA, FPL, FPC and TAL sites.  Look for any trans available for next day on a hourly or daily basis.  Let the morning guys know of any availability during the morning hand-off.  And on the weekends look for it during the days.  If you see that trans is avail. for Monday on Sunday night give Miguel or myself a call(Before 11:00 p.m).  That is all
