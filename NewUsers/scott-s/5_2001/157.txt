Hey Em,

Hope the parental visit is going well and that you haven't lost your mind yet.  I just wanted to drop you a line to share with you my latest little upset (aside from getting physically ill at Teala's Friday night...it was ugly).  Nick emailed yesterday and said he wanted to call and catch up.  When he finally did call I knew within the first minute why he felt the need to call, the engagement is OFF.  They evidently decided to postpone about two weeks ago and the final blow came Friday night.  To top everything off, he's moving back to Houston in three weeks...ughh.  Obviously, given my last conversation with him in London, I'm a little concerned.  Oh well, who wants a non-stressful existence anyway.

Ta for now,
Sue
