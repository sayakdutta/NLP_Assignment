Haven't decided yet, although I'd like to do dinner...any suggestions?

 

sorry, i thought i told you that i was going to the astros game last night with paula.  it was interesting.  tonight i may be going over to jayshree's with priya for dinner, but i will be home before to shower and clean up after i work out.  did we decide on dinner or just drinks tomorrow night?  either is fine with me.

 

no plans...where were you last night?

 

whats up?  just saying hello.  are you doing anything tonight?
