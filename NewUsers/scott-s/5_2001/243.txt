Matty already left work, but I'll be sure to pass the message along.

 

you all need to buy me tequila shots for my birthday so I can pass out on the couch at uropa, and then throw up in the bushes across the street

 

Nah, that sounds like a boring night.  I can only get completely drunk and dance like a jackass so many times in one lifetime.  

 

do you guys want to hit el patio early on saturday and get some blue ritas and then head over to uropa?  that would be a good night to go tear it up completely.
