Hey Paul,

I'm so glad you emailed.  My parents were just asking me what you were up to this past Sunday...now I'll have something to report to them.  It's good to hear that things are going so well for you and I must say I'm a tad envious you're getting to do so many things you've always wanted to this summer (I'm still trying to figure out exactly what those things are).  

We will most certainly have to get together next week while you're in town.  I may be going to Austin for part of the long weekend, but I doubt I'll go before Saturday so Thursday and Friday are definite possibilities.  Happy to hear about your brother and Josh's impending marriages and can't wait to find out what school will next be graced with the presence of Paul Thomas.

Talk to you soon,
Susan

PS- Alan, you'll have to come out with us now....no more hiding.


 

Hey Alan, Lisa and Susan,

How are thing going down in Houston?  I hope things
are going great.

I am going to be in town next Thursday, Friday,
Saturday and Sunday and I was wondering if yall had
time to hang-out?  I haven't seen any of you in a
while and I would love to hear how you are doing.

If you were curious, life is good for me.  This summer
is going to be one of the busiest(and coolest) I have
have ever had.  I am doing alot of stuff I have always
wanted to do(missions trip to Costa Rica, helping
start a small business, best man in my brother
wedding, usher in Josh Williams wedding, etc, etc)!
Next fall I will be going to get my MBA - I am
supposed to decide where I will be going by the end of
the week.....

Anyway, if any of yall have time let me know. I would
love to see you.


Paul Thomas
