As usual Alan, I am left somewhat disturbed by your words...and by the way,=
 do you ever return phone calls?  As for the rest of you guys, I anxiously =
await our impending reunion in Cap City.  Glad to hear everyone seems to be=
 doing okay, with the exception of Emily who appears to be suffering from a=
 severe case of spring fever.  Jon Jon, went to an Astros game a couple wee=
ks ago and saw your name on the scoreboard...it made me feel special.  The =
trader I work with, who was there with me, is a huge baseball fan and upon =
hearing I went to school with you has insisted upon checking your stats reg=
ularly...seems you're not doing to shabby.  Congrats.  Life for me is prett=
y good, although I'm in desperate need of a deep, drunken conversation rega=
rding life and all it's complexities (I expect everyone to contribute to sa=
id discussion when we convene).  I'm sure I'm not the only one, but things =
just seem to be getting less certain the older I get.  Don't want to get to=
 heavy now...so I'll saw the really bleak stuff for Austin.

Ciao,
Sue
