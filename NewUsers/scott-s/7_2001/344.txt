I actually think we have the Monday off (Sept. 3).  So, ideally I'd fly in Friday evening and fly out Monday afternoon.  I'll email more later, but just thought I'd give you a heads up.

hi susan-  sorry i missed your call on sunday!  i was totally hung over and
lying on the beach, and my cell phone doesn't always get reception
there.  labor day definitely works for me- call me if you want to today to
discuss, or we can email and work everything out that way.  i have no plans
as of now, so whatever works for you, works for me!  i can take off friday,
if necessary, or you can fly in friday afternoon or friday evening and we
can have all day friday, saturday, and most of sunday.

hope you had a fun weekend- can't wait to see you again!
