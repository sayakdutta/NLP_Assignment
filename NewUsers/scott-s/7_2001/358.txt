I know I've thoroughly enjoyed all the commentary.  I can honestly say, I think this is the first time I've been invited to an Aggie happy hour....and to that end, kudos to all those who opted out of Sam's Boat...you now may be forced to deal with a longhorn interloper.


 


This was all very entertaining.  Did I miss the meeting time?
 

 
sorry mo. i had not read your e-mail until after i had sent mine.  oops!  
 
tony's sounds like fun to me, it's in the neighborhood, and i hear they have kick-ass ritas.  
 
the friends are in.  see you at tony's.
 
 

By looking at the clock, it would appear the Mo beat Trip to the punch by 1 minute.  Accompany that with the fact that we have not gone to Tony's as a group, and just recently went to the Front Porch, and haven't been to Cahill's in a long time and it's crappy outside.  Therefore I have to give the nod to...
 
the Sanchezcamp, barring a major uproar from the Friend camp.
 
What say ye?
