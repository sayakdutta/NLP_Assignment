I've been wondering if you were alive....sorry I missed your call last Thursday, I was in a meeting.  We seem to be in meetings for several hours everyday lately.  Anyway, did you have the "Welcome Back Emily Party"?  If so I'm guessing you've been recovering for a couple of days.  Hope the paper(s) is/are going well.

Talk to you soon,
Sue

PS - I'm in Seattle this weekend, so I'll miss the friend.

 

bonjour girls- am relishing the balmy london weather- today: 73 degrees and
breezy- and no rain to speak of.  sorry- had to rub it in a little.
anyways, got an email from marci's LA friend that i met while he was
visiting in london.  he is a producer working for animal planet doing
documentaries on dog shows, one of which took him to london.  now he's
coming to houston this wednesday for the reliant energy dog show, and
emailed me to let me know, since he's "helping" dad find the ultimate female
GSP.  so.....i emailed him bk, suggesting he try to meet up w/ y'all, that
you could show him the houston ropes, so to speak, and gave him your names
and phone #s.  kates- you already know jim from LA, and maybe marce has
already given him your #.  am not sure.  but anyways, he is really nice,
easy to talk to (even for moi, miss antisocial) and could be a fun night
out.  just wanted to give you  heads up in case some weirdo named jim casey
called and you were totally clueless....chat w/ you soon!  merci, little
hostesses!
