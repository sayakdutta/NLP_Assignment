Attached for your review is a draft of Transport Options filing that 
incorporates the comments and suggestions I've received since last week.  
Please provide any further suggestions/changes to me as soon as possible, but 
in no case later than close of business, Friday, July 14.  

The timeline I've discussed with TW Commercial for this project is as follows:

Final draft comments   Friday, July 14

Circulate draft to customers,
customer meetings, time for
customers to respond, informal 
discussion with FERC   Mon. July 17 - Wed. July 26

Final internal review/edit of filing  Thursday, July 27

Please let me know your comments on this proposed timeline as well.  Thank 
you.
