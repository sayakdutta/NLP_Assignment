Ken, here are the confidentiality agreements that should be signed prior to 
our providing information to our vendors.  Each agreement should be printed 
as duplicate originals on TW letterhead, and signed by an officer of TW.  I 
understand that Mike Nelson is out due to a death in the family; Steve Harris 
is out this week also.  Perhaps Julia White would be willing to sign in order 
to expedite things.

If you have any questions or need further assistance with any aspect of these 
agreements please do not hesitate to call (x30596) or come by.
