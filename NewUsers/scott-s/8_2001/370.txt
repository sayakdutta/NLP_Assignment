Great....sounds good to me.  Can't wait to see you guys.

 


I changed the time.  You will get in around 6:00 pm on Sunday now, and only leave Korea 30 minutes earlier.  I'll e-mail you the entire itenerary tomorrow morning (my time) for your final approval.  I will buy the tickets after you have a chance to give the times one more look.

there....in the grand scheme of life.


Susan,
Haven't bought your tickets yet, but have a feeling I won't be able to
do anything about you getting in at 9:00pm Sunday. I will ask though.
You should be leaving on Tuesday and returning to Houston on Sunday (and
leaving Korea on Sunday). The total air fare should be $962. Shoot me
a quick e mail if this is not ok. Otherwise, I will plan on purchasing
your tickets this afternoon. Thanks!
-Chris
