Paul,

So nice to hear from you.  I hope things are going great for you as well.  I'm actually going Laura Jahnke's wedding that same evening.  Otherwise, I would have loved to have gone.  Please tell Nathan I say, "hello" and wish he and his new wife the very best.  So when does school start?  And, how are the small businesses going?

Have a nice time at the wedding,
Susan

 

Hey Susan,

I hope things are going great!

Do you remember Nathan Thomas?  He is getting married
on August 11th(I will be one of the groomsmen).

I thought you might be interested.


Have fun,
Paul

PS - How are things going?
