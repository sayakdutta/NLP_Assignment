I will definitely do my best to make it out there before October.

 

HI Susan-
That's totally fine- I completely understand.  I was considering going up to  Ventura to visit a friend for the weekend, but of course didn't want to make any plans until I heard from you.  Sounds like you have a lot of fun events coming up!  I'll email you- there might be 2 other weekends that work for me - unfortunately time is flying SO fast!!  But even if you can't come out before the end of October, we'll have to plan some time to get together soon....I'll send you those dates later.
Have a safe trip to Korea, busy girl! glad to hear that all is going well with you!

I know, I know....I dropped off the face of the earth for a while.  I've
actually been in Denver all week for a Natural Gas Convention.  As for
Labor Day weekend, I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to make it.  I'm
leaving for S. Korea next Tuesday and don't get back until the weekend
before Labor Day weekend.  So issue one is, will I have enough energy to
make the trip?  The other issue is a friend's wedding in Park City that
same weekend.  I'd feel bad skipping her wedding but still going on a trip.
So.....I was thinking maybe it'd be better all around if I came a different
weekend.  Why don't you take a look at your calendar and let me know what
other dates in September look good to you.
