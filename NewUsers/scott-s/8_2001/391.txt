I'll try giving you a call tonight just to catch up and see how things are going.  Were you planning on going walking?

... KOREA!?!?!  Eh?  Well, no can say your life isn't exciting!  Wow, I
can't wait to hear about it!

I got your message Saturday.  I was in Austin and Matt and I were actually
registering at Breed & Co. when you called... sorry I missed you!

No worries about the music... we just need to get together soon!  AND, no
worries about the bachelorette party... I would definitely say Korea's
slightly more enticing! :o)

When you have a minute could I get your dad's full name and your parent's
address?

Thanks friend -- I HOPE to hear from you soon!

Love,

Jen
