Capacity


Attached is an e-mail containing revisions and additions El Paso recommends be
made to SoCalGas' draft Exhibit 28 which was distributed for further comment 
to
parties on June 16, 2000.  This e-mail has two attachments.  The first 
attachment
is a revised copy of SoCalGas' table titled "Firm Pipeline Capacity into 
Southern
California" with changes to:  (a) correct the amount of firm interstate 
capacity on
El Paso at Topock, shown in the col. "Incoming Interstate Capacity," by 
replacing
the incorrect figure, 2230 MMcfd (which includes capacity for delivery to SW 
Gas
which is not available to California on a firm basis) with the correct 
figure,  2080
MMcfd; (b) delete the reference to El Paso delivery capacity to SW Gas from 
the
col. "Total Take-away Capacity" since this capacity is not firm capacity 
available
to California; (c) adjust the totals at the bottom of both cols. affected by 
these
changes; (d) add a new footnote to reference to the fact that shippers on El 
Paso
have existing firm contract rights for delivery from El Paso at Topock to 
SoCalGas
totaling 1466 MMcfd which exceeds SoCalGas' take-away capacity at Topock
and clearly creates a "mismatch"; and (c) add reference in footnote (2) to the
physical capacity of Kern/Mojave at the interconnection with SoCalGas at
Wheeler Ridge South, which is in excess of 680 MMcfd even though the metering
is currently set to 500 MMcfd.   The second attachment contains two schematics
intended to supplement SoCalGas' draft map of receipt points and
interconnections.  These schematics more accurately reflect the actual 
physical
interconnections at Topock and Hector Ridge and correct both the inaccurate
impression that the interconnect with  El Paso at Topock consists of several
separate pipelines with no cross over, and that inaccurate impression that 
several
interconnections may exist between pipelines at Hector Road .   El Paso
understands and acknowledges that there are a number of possible responses to
Administrative Law Judge Biren's request for a late filed exhibit concerning
"mismatches" and pipeline capacity upstream and downstream from SoCalGas
receipt points.  In the spirit of compromise, El Paso  will not oppose 
SoCalGas
filing an exhibit as proposed 6/16/00 provided it is revised to reflect the 
changes
and additions El Paso has proposed in this e-mail.   Very truly yours, Edward
