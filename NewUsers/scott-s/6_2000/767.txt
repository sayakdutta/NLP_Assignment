Yes...I am a true Longhorn.  I think that's why I like Steak Night so much.  
I mean how can you beat sitting on a deck, drinking a beer and solving the 
words problems (OK., 2 out of 3 ain't bad).  Anyway, Wednesday night sounds 
good to me, although, given how work has been going lately I doubt I'll be 
able to get there before 7:30.  Just do me a favour and forewarn Pat that 
Emily may be attending so he can prepare properly (I don't want any 
bloodshed).  I think a couple co-workers are also planning on coming so it 
should a good group.
