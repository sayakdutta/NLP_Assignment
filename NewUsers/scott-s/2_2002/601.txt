Thanks Kathy...

Would you mind letting me know when I have access to the curve validation file in the O:// drive, or if there's anything I need to do to secure those rights.  Currently we are actually trying to track down who has the broker quotes.  Chance Rabon has said he will do some research and I've contacted some of the traders from the West Desk who were in charge of collecting that information.

FYI - Below are procedures for populating the curve validation templates.  All templates have now been loaded with curve information and are now ready for the broker quotes.  Could you please also keep me informed of where you stand in the process of completing these.

Thanks, 

Kathy Kelly

All,

Attached is the preliminary draft of the Natural Gas procedures for Trader actions in populating the template.

Kathy, I'm getting this to you as a heads-up.  There are specific actions the traders need to take in order to populate the templates accurately.  Please share this info. with them; they shouldn't wait on us for the final copy.
