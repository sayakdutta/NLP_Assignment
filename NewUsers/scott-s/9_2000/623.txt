So who's up for doing something that Friday night?  I'll probably be in 
Austin Saturday for the football game, but am definitely interested in 
getting together with everyone.  Obviously this is planning WAY in advance 
for this group so we can revisit the topic when Wilson's arrival is a little 
bit closer.  Talk to y'all then.

* Darren - Please tell me you have Wilson's keys...Margaret and I would be 
eternally grateful.
