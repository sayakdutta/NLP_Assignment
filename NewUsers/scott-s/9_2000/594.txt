                   HOROSCOPE:     Weekly   -    His

                   For September 25-October 1: Instead of wishing
                   things were different, or woefully mourning the
                   past, build a new beginning. It's pointless to
                   bemoan recent changes or languish over
                   disappointments. You cannot change the past.
                   You cannot change people's minds, either. Face
                   your situation and create something wonderful.
                   The longer you fuss about what 'should have
                   been', the more likely it is that important
                   opportunities will drift by unnoticed. Cancer, it is
                   time for change. Release frustrations and
                   troubling memories. Move on, Crab. . . move
                   on. 


Mine for today

   Quickly get past a troubling misunderstanding
   Once you've released toxic feelings,
                   the atmosphere visibly improves, much to your
                   pleasure. You're able to replace fear and
                   resentment with compassion and
                   understanding. Once you know the score, you
                   no longer feel threatened or disrespected. Keep
                   revenge out of this entire episode. 'Teaching
                   someone a lesson' is not appropriate.
