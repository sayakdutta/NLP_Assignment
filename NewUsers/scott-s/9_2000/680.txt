Cheryl,

The deal was done with one of the California Power Books.  We use the 
ECC/RISKMANTRA to book any deal with an Enron subsidiary...not just Canadian 
deals.  So, I don't think this deal has anything to do with the Canada 
office.  Let me know if you need more information.

Hi Susan

I am trying to verify the liquidations for financial close and noted that 
TAGG deal NK4420.1 entered by yourself
shows ECC (Enron Canada Corp) as the counterparty.

Here in Canada, we do not to deals at NGI-PGE/CG and I do not believe that 
the book PWR-NG-LTCA is a Canadian
book.  A review of the audit trial indicates that the counterparty used to be 
EPMI.  Is it possible it was changed by
mistake to ECC.

Can you please look into this deal first thing Monday morning as we need to 
book the liquidations Monday am for
financial close and let me know what you think about this deal.

Thanks for your help.

Cheryl
