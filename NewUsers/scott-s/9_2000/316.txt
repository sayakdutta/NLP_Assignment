Hi Misty!  How's everything?  Are we on for this weekend?  Let me know.  
Since I have plans to see Lyle Lovett on Fri. night, I was thinking of flying 
in rather than driving Sat. a.m. to save on time & energy, especially since 
you live so close to the airport!

Painted my bedroom Happy Yellow while listening to the U.S. Open weekend 
before last...drank a lot of beer also.  Am amazed it turned out as well as 
it did.

You said you work with someone named Hamlet, right?  Apparently he used to 
live across the street from Karin and Jim, on Evans!  I didn't think there 
could possibly be 2 Hamlets.  Small world.
