I am refraining from responding to this until I have had time to ponder 
things this weekend.

Hey,

I apologize for being out of touch recently but I was on vacation last week 
and this week has been busy.  Things seemed a bit awkward recently and I 
would like to see if we could get a beer and chat next week if you are free 
(after Tuesday night because I'll be in Amarillo talking to feedlot operators 
early next week). Enjoy your weekend and my condolences about UT's fall out 
of the top 10.

Ted
