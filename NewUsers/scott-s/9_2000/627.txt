These horoscopes can not possibly be speaking to every Aquarian out there.  
I'm convinced the author is someone I know...I would suggest it was my Mom, 
but 
her insight and advice would never be this good. 

Aquarius 
      For September 14: You have a knack for bringing people together and
                     creating peace. Part of your success in waging peace is 
derived from a desire
                     to let go of resentment and a bulging catalog of woe. 
You're sick and tired of
                     feeling sick and tired, and look forward to a refreshing 
sensation of starting
                     anew. Seriously consider hatching deferred dreams today. 
What's stopping
                     you?

So last night at Tony's John says:
I think you are going to get pregnant as a result of these margaritas.
