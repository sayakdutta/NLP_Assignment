Hi Jose,

I just wanted to check in and see how you are doing these days, and more importantly where you are?  I'm still at Enron right now working for the "estate".  I've been interviewing and have a few offers, but am not completely sure what I will be doing.  Hope all is well with you and I'd love to hear what is going on in your life.

Susan
