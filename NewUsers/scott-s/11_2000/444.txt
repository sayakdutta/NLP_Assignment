The deals included below are strictly index flat gas daily options.  I'm 
going to send Shouan an Index +/- deal as well so that he can verify that the 
basis offset is valuing correctly in both situations.

Hi Susan,

I changed the code so that it feeds the Ostrip model as Larry requested by 
using the formula to derive BasisOffset. In the attached file is the 
comparison between the old valuation and the one after the modification. 
Please note the changes on the premiums. Please let me know if you or Larry 
have any questions/comments on this.
