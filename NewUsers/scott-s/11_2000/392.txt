Hi Maria Victoria!  I'm planning to be there right at 12.  At the entrance 
they usually have a table where you pick up your name tag; we can meet there 
if you like.  See you soon!








Hello!!!
Hope things went really well for you last week/end.  I wanted to check if you 
will be attending the CLE presentation today so that we can arrange to meet 
there.
Maria Victoria
