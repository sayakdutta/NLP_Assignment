I found the picture from Tin Hall the other night and that guy at Whataburger 
was definitely one of the "cute cowboys."  How weird is that?  Anyway, hope 
you're flight home and immediate transition to the classroom went smoothly.  
I guess I'll be seeing you in about two weeks and by that time, hopefully, 
I'll know more about my London prospects.
