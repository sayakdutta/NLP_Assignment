The book code is ALWAYS - XZ.  As for trade dates, that is not one of the 
fields I fill in for the exotics spreadsheet and I don't think that's 
something we'd really want to add as the file already takes up an extremely 
large amout of memory.

Could you in the future please put trade dates and book codes on the 
spreadsheet? Thanks!!!
