 

hey-got your message this morning- was out and about w/ nikki when you
called.  haven't been plugging the phone in lately b/c is not easy to get a
line out to the states still.  no planes to us still this morning, and of
course dad had to send one of his melodramatic doom and gloom emails about
me NOT coming, but am honestly not worried about it.  he's freaking out.
have my fingers crossed that maybe will make it out tomorrow....not much to
report around here- just kind of wandering in a fog, you know?  no longer
absolutely miserable, just numb.  ok- prob about to go back to sleep- had to
wake up at 5 this morn to see if BA was flying out this morning...to no
avail.  chat soon-
