Our consulting agreement with IGS for services related to the CPUC proceeding 
expired 12/31/99 but can be continued by mutual agreement of the parties.  
Given the upcoming proceedings, I'd recommend that we act on this sooner 
rather than later...let me know and I'll draft a brief letter to Mark 
Baldwin.
