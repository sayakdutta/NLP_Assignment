Yes, I am going home before the reception and am going to have Katy meet me at the apartment around 6:15 (at least that's what time I'm telling her).  If you want to tell Laura to meet at the apartment around that time too, I will be there to greet her.  I'm going to drop off some dry cleaning, finish my laundry and clean up a bit before they get there.  I'm so glad everyone is up for this outing...we are so culturally aware.  

So that's the plan.  I suggest we eat somewhere around the Museum District...I'll do some research this afternoon.

Talk to you later,
Sue
