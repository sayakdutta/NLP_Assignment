Mike,

I see in your emails below that you are indicating that the allocation proc=
ess does not comply with the tariff. The allocation process I do not think =
is the problem. It is the way the rates are used today for PNR. Today, the =
only rates I think that are loaded in CBS are the posted rates and the tari=
ff rates. If you want the rate to carry through at the contract level for t=
he range of dates of the specific deal, then the rates must be loaded that =
way in CBS for each PNR deal that is granted prior to the timely allocation=
 process. If the allocation does not find a contract specific rate, then it=
 looks for the next level which is your posted rates, if no posted rates ar=
e found, then it looks for tariff rates on PNR. It sounds like to me that T=
W will need to implement specific deal sheets and calculate the specific ra=
tes for each deal sheet on a daily basis & load the total specific contract=
 deal rate in CBS.  Please let me know if there are other problems in the a=
llocation process itself.

Thanks Ramona

Regarding my meeting invitation..............I hope this helps.

I've had a series of e-mails with Marketing, Legal and Regulatory regarding=
 TW PNR in an effort to finalize the process and procedures. As a result, I=
've learned that TW's allocation process does not comply with the tariff. (=
See below) Marketing wants to continue with current practices, but changes =
are required for the allocation process.=20

Mike,

I recommend that we continue to use the current practices we are using now =
of charging the PNR rate posted on the day service begins.  I also recommen=
d that we continue our current practice of  using the nomination process an=
d posted rates for PNR service.   In the future, we may choose to change th=
ose practices to one of the methods you recommended below.  It is helpful t=
o know that that would require system changes and new language on the posti=
ngs to accommodate any new change of that sort. =20

Thanks for your help on this.

Sue & Kevin,

I need some help from you..............
Based on the response from Susan Scott and Glen Hass (below),=20

Should TW continue the practice of charging the PNR rate posted on the day =
service begins or charge the rate posted daily? (Using the latter, TW's pos=
ted rates would include the text Susan provides below)
 =20
Should TW continue to use the nomination process and posted rates for PNR s=
ervice or revert back to entering into individual purchase orders for each =
deal?
The individual purchase orders are not as convenient , but they provide bet=
ter clarity between the parties.

TW's allocation program uses the posted and/or deal rates entered into CBS =
when capacity is allocated. It  does not calculate ..."the greatest total c=
ost commitment". System modifications are needed to determine which shipper=
 has the greatest cost commitment.  =20

You asked:

=091.  For a customer keeping a PNR balance for several days, is it accepta=
ble to charge whatever is the posted rate for each of those days, or should=
 TW charge the rate in effect on the first day of the balance?

=09Answer:  The tariff doesn't say.  I believe this is a business decision.=
  Would we rather charge the same rate every day, or are both parties OK wi=
th taking the risk that it will go up or down from day to day?  My understa=
nding is that we presently charge the same rate that was in effect on the s=
ame day.  I also understand that, rather than documenting the rate in a con=
tract or other writing, we rely on our posting.  If we change our practice =
and start charging the posted rate applicable to each rate, I recommend at =
a minimum that we notify our customers in a posting.  From a legal standpoi=
nt I also have to recommend that the rate be documented in a deal sheet, e-=
mail or other writing.  While we may be indifferent (after all, Form M says=
 the max rate applies in absence of an agreement to the contrary), document=
ation of the actual rate could save us hassle if a conflict arises.

=09Another thing:  There is nothing to keep us from charging some shippers =
the posted rate on the first day for the entire term of the balance, and ot=
her shippers the posted rate from day to day.  However, there can be no dis=
crepancy among similarly situated shippers.  To avoid the appearance of dis=
crimination, I'd recommend choosing one method or the other, if that is fea=
sible from a business standpoint. =20

=09Assuming you are going to use the day to day approach for all shippers, =
here are my recommendations:

=09My recommended language to include on the rate posting webpage would be =
something to this effect:  BALANCES CARRIED FORWARD FROM DAY TO DAY SHALL B=
E CHARGED THE RATES APPLICABLE TO EACH DAY OF THE BALANCE.  (If this looks =
awkward to you let's discuss a better way to say it.)

=09I recognize PNR deals happen within minutes.  However, if it is possible=
 to do an e-mail or fax, it could read:  The rate applicable to Contract No=
. ______ on each day that quantities are parked or ridden shall be the rate=
 posted on Transwestern's website for that day.  Another option might be ju=
st to include this language as an attachment to the master agreement; it wo=
uld not have to be done for each deal.

2.  If we have the following situation:  Shipper A has parked 10,000 dth fo=
r a week and wants to move it out; Shipper B wants to ride 10,000 dth; we c=
an only accommodate schedule activity totaling 10,000 dth -- who gets prior=
ity?

=09Answer:  Shipper A should have priority because it has the greatest tota=
l cost commitment to TW in accordance with Sheet 37E of the tariff.
