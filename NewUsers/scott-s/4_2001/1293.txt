Laura and Ed--
Attached are EES comments on the Illinois Commerce Commission inquiry into the possibility of establishing some additional requirements on retail suppliers that serve both residential and industrial customers (EPMI and EES are both ARES).  I think the comments are fine and promote a market based approach that focuses on real customer protection issues.  Gloria will keep you both informed of further developments by the ICC.

Christi --

Do you think this would cover EPMI's interests?  What about Peoples deal?

Jim, 
The Illinois Commerce Commission has initiated an inquiry into the activities of agents in the Illinois electric market with a view to organizing follow up workshops or rulemakings to regulate some aspects of agency activities. Their definition of agent includes power marketers, aggregators and resellers. I have filed Enron comments in this proceeding, which as the below e-mail suggests may set the tone of the proceedings. I am forwarding this to you to ascertain if there is ENA interest in monitoring this proceedings, and who will be the appropriate ENA party to update. I attach herewith, a copy of the comments. 
 

Thanks,
Gloria

and complimentary response regarding the Comments that Enron submitted this
