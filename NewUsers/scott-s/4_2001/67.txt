Ships passing in the night....I'm glad you get to see the fam this weekend.  Be sure to tell everyone I say, "Hello!"  As for the zoo, I am a huge fan.  It's the only zoo I've ever been to that I don't feel sorry for the animals.  It's too bad things weren't better co-ordinated but I think my weekend's going to be pretty full regardless.  Have a great holiday weekend and I'll talk to you soon.

Em's in the Canary Islands this week...can you believe that little brat?

Hola!
I was just in San Diego this past Sun - Tues visiting Mookie during his
training. He's working for XO Communications in Austin. Today, I'm going to
San Francisco to meet my parents and Chelsea for Easter. I won't be back to
LA until Monday afternoon. I wish I could go back to San Diego and see you.
You'll have a great time! It's a fun city. Make sure you go to the zoo for
at least a few hours. It's the greatest!

Have fun,
Kasey
