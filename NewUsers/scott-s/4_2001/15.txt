Hey girls...I hate this, but I may be out Thursday.  Please still let me know where you guys are going to be and if anything changes I'll meet you there.  Otherwise, have a great time and to both Lisa and Jen, I need to see you guys and hear all about the honeymoon and the proposal           ( both are very good things and I love good things ).

I think Aries is the one- event though it is $$$.
Since Ashlea went to Fox Diner last week and only said
good as a comment, then I say we go for it and try
Aries.  7pm on Thursday it is if everyone else agrees.
 I'll send the e-vite after I get a few approvals.

Hasta!
Sarah
