no problem...i've been good, just busy with the new job.  all of the sudden i actually have time to do things so i spent the last weekend just trying to get my life re-organized.  not a very exciting weekend, but extremely necessary.  what's up with you?

 

thanks...so how have you been lately?

 

looks like the curve was marked around 9.0625 for jun/sept...but you'll have to talk to keith holst to get an absolute price
