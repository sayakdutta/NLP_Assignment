          > >These two are going to rob me.
          > >Her next thought was:
          > >Don't be a bigot, they look like perfectly nice
          gentlemen.
          > >
          > >But racial stereotypes are powerful, and fear immobilized
          her.
          > >She stood and stared at the two men.
          > >She felt anxious, flustered, and ashamed.
          > >
          > >She hoped they didn't read her mind, but knew they
          > >surely did; her hesitation about joining them on the

          > >She couldn't just stand there, so with a mighty effort of
          will
          > >she picked up one foot and stepped forward and followed

          > >
          > >Avoiding eye contact, she turned around stiffly and
          > >faced the elevator doors as they closed.  A second
          > >passed, and then another second, and then another.
          > >Her fear increased The elevator didn't move.  Panic
          > >consumed her.  My God, she thought, I'm trapped and
          > >about to be robbed.  Her heart plummeted.
          > >Perspiration  poured from every pore.  Then ... one
          > >of the men said, "Hit the floor."
          > >Instinct told her: Do what they tell you.
          > >
          > >The bucket of quarters flew upwards as she
          > >threw out her arms and collapsed
          > >on the elevator carpet.
          > >
          > > A shower of coins rained down on her.  Take my money
          > >and spare me, she prayed.  More seconds passed.
          > >
          > >She heard one of the men say politely, 'Ma'am, if
          > >you'll just tell us what floor you're going to,
          > >we'll push the button.'  The one who said it had a
          > >little trouble getting the words out.  He was trying
          > >mightily to hold in a belly laugh.
          > >
          > >She lifted her head and looked up at the two men.
          > >They reached down to help her up.
          > >Confused, she struggled to her feet.
          > >
          > >"When I told my man here to hit the floor," said the
          > >average sized one, "I meant that he should hit the
          > >elevator button for our floor.  I didn't mean for
          > >you to hit the floor, ma'am."  He spoke genially.
          > >He bit his lip.
          > >It was obvious he was having a hard time not laughing.
          > >
          > >She thought: my goodness, what a spectacle I've made
          > >of myself.  She was too humiliated to speak.  She
          > >wanted to blurt out an apology, but words failed her.
          > >
          > >How do you apologize to two perfectly respectable
          > >gentlemen for behaving as though they were going to
          > >rob you?  She didn't know what to say.

          > >The 3 of them gathered up the strewn quarters and
          refilled her bucket.
          > >When the elevator arrived at her floor, they
