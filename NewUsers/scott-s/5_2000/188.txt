Elizabeth -- As we discussed, billing will need to take place pursuant to 
Section 30.8(e) (i.e., refund or credit to the releasing shipper).

Here is the language you requested for our posting:

In accordance with Section 30.9(f) of the General Terms and Conditions of 
Transwestern's Tariff, Releasing Shipper shall remain liable to Transwestern 
for payment of reservation charges and any applicable surcharges.

If you need anything further please don't hesitate to call.
