In honour of your departure I think it is only right that we do "Red Meat" 
one more time.  I feel as though I've said this a lot lately 
but...Congratulations.  I don't want to devalue the statement by repeating it 
over and over again so just know that I am completely sincere when I say it.  
The money sounds fantastic, although I hope that aside from the money you 
enjoy and are challenged by your new role.  I may not know you inside and out 
but I do know that you need to be in an exciting and fast-paced environment 
to hold your interest and sustain motivation and this sounds like it will 
provide that for you.  Also, the step up position-wise is great and I think 
deserved.  As far as being scared goes, that'll be our little secret.  You do 
know though that fear is a great motivator and often provides us with that 
extra push to do and try the things we may not have otherwise done.  

I guess this means I'll have a good excuse to visit NY.

I guess we should do  red meat one last time before i leave.
I got the official offer on Paper, and well...i'm blown away.Couldn't sleep 
last night
I'm now a manager..yeah you heard me right.
I'm Manager of Internet Marketing...WOW...and well the money..Well you can 
ask around you what Manager make, i blew past the 100K, like a crazy ".com" 
myself....I'm excited and scared, yes scared...i'll admit, but don't tell 
anyone.
SO i'm a little confuse on some things such as when i'm actually moving to 
NY, but Im in NY for Work next week.
So it will happen fast and i'm out of Enron this week.
That's the news...
