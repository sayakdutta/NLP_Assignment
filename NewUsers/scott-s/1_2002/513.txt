Hey old married woman....what's up!?

I got your x-mas card...that was too cute.  I hope all is well with you and that you had a fantastic New Year.  

I'm also glad you and Matt liked your wedding gift...I absolutely LOVED that pitcher.  I knew I wanted to get that for you the second I saw it, really too cool.  (Didn't hurt that my parents wanted to pitch in on the gift.)  

Anyway, I really just wanted to touch base and see how life's been treating you and your new hubby.  I had a good Christmas w/ family and an EXTREMELY low key New Year - which was definitely ok w/ me.

Hope to see you soon,
Susan
