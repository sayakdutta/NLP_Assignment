Hey Holly,

Just wanted to drop you a line and let you know how happy I was that we were able to get together for lunch on Saturday.  I really enjoyed meeting you and hearing about your experiences in Seattle thus far.  Hope all is going well with you and that you continue to enjoy your new home.

Susan
