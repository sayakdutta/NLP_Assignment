Just found out from Minal that you guys are going to Osteria D'Aldo for your 
shower.  I hope you have a wonderful time but I have to warn you that the 
wine selection is extensive and the food is fantastic (although not very 
low-cal).  I know you're in the final stretch of the bet, however this just 
might be cause for a loss.  

Bon Appetit!
