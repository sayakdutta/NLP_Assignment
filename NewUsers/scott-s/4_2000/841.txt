Can you guys book a few deals this way in the test environment.  They are 
testing to see if they are able to generate an accurate confirm this way.  
Thanks for your help!!!

As per our discussion of this a.m., ENA IT has a "program fix" in Stage which 
will handle 
the generation of confirmations for Gas Daily swaps that may be booked as two 
legs in the
future.  This change effects both TAGG - Deal Capture and TAGG - Deal 
Clearing.

In order to be ready for the commercial people in case they use the two 
legged Gas Daily
deal, I am requesting that your Gas Daily team input maybe 20-25 deals in 
TAGG - Deal
Capture using the new guidelines.  Ron Nolte has outlined below how the input 
process 
should be handled for these types of deals.

I will be out of the office Monday and Tuesday of next week so I am 
requesting that the Gas 
Daily team have these deals in by next Wednesday.

Thanks for your help.

Bob,

Ricky is in the process of changing TAGG Deal Clearing to be able to combine 
the deal leg
containing the Nymex ( fixed )  price and the deal leg containing the Gas 
Daily( float )  price onto one
confirm.

In order for this as well as the changes to the Settlement process  to work, 
the following rules
must be adhered to when the deal is captured.

1) The fixed price must be entered as leg 1.
2) The float price must be entered as leg 2.

3) Leg 1 and leg 2 must be "linked" by clicking the "Link" button on the deal 
capture
 window and by inserting a row as follows:

 

 The "Purpose" above will be listed as "Deal Link" when the picklist 
displays.  The "Link" can be
 done from either leg 1 or leg 2.

 4) The  confirm can only be created/revised/viewed/printed/faxed  from leg 1.

 5) The clearing status of the deal can only be changed from leg 1.

 Please note that  any change to the status of either leg will be reflected 
on the other
 leg automatically; e.g., assume a confirm is created on leg 1,  the deal 
status of both 
 legs will display "Generated".  Then assume someone changes leg 2 in Deal 
Capture,
 the status of both legs in TAGG deal clearing will be automatically set to 
"Pending -
 Revised after Generated".
