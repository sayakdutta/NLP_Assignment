Who's picking on me?

I'll see what I can do but most of my girlfriends live in other cities and 
besides who wants to expend energy entertaining second string candidates?

thanks////hey, if you know any girls...you should invite them. Maybe everyone 
won't be picking on you so much, if it's not a sausage fest everytime
