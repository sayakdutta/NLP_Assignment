pull out your settlement matrix and see if this SA agrees with that 
document.  I don't necessarily think it does.  Didn't we basically agree to 
disagree and/or deal with this issue outside the settlement process?  Are you 
saying that Edison can reserve capacity in the same manner as Core and 50% of 
noncore, but at the approx. 7.9 cent rate?

HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.... is this language saying that they can convert the 
VALUE of their capacity rights to a capacity contract at the point?  For 
example, if Edison has 200/d at 1 cent Wheeler access fee, they could conver 
it to approx. 25/d at the full 7.9 cent rate?

Let's get clarification!!!











I agree 100% and I want them to state they may elect the capacity however,
it is at the current rate if you will.  This is an attempt to take us back
several weeks in my opinion.




Rob,
Look at the conforming languange in the Appendix "A" last page, last
paragraph.  You know that this language was negotiated by and between
SoCalGas and Edison.  My main concern is that its very, very open ended...
almost a contingent liability for all settlement parties.
