What's up?

I will be coming in town the weekend of Nov 1st - Nov 4th.  I hope you don't have plans for that Saturday.  I'll find out today if I can get him for the whole day (12:00 to 7:00) If things workout I would like to take him to Vero for the day.  So I was thinking you could go with me to pick him up and we could spend the day and night in Vero?  Let me know what you think?  My sister will probably also come (just for the day).  As soon as I find out I'll let you know.

Anyway,  how are things down there?  Last weekend I went to Austin for the UT and Colorado game (Austin is an awesome place!!!)

Bird, where you in town this weekend? I talked to your sister for a little while and she said you might be coming into town.  
The Astros are good.  What's going on with Peyton? I am sure Tonya is being reasonable again.
