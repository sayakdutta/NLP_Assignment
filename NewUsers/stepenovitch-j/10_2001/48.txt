Good Morning Jonda,

I would like to met with Mr. Fullenweider today if that is possible?  I'm going out of town Thursday thru Sunday of this week.  I think it is very important that I speak with him as soon as possible.  Please let me know if today is good for him.  Thanks again,

-Joe

 


Dear Joe,
 
Would it be possible for you to come in one  day next week at about 3:00 p.m. to go over your discovery responses?   Alternatively, you could come in two days at 4:00 p.m.  On Thursday, I  leave early for my son's soccer practice.  Perhaps Tuesday and Friday would  be good for you???
