Jonda,

I understand Mr. Fullenweider has meeting but after what Tonya put me and my family through last week we would like some answers and action.  I have cut off all communication with her and now she is sending me emails (trying to act like nothing happened) I'm sure her lawyer is telling her to do that so she can say she has been keeping me informed of my son. (I will forward them to you)  I am very upset and I'm sure you can understand why, I really think there is something really wrong ( I just have that feeling or she is mentally unstable )  How can she be aloud to keep me from my son?

Anyway,  If I can't meet with Mr. Fullenwerider can you and I meet to go over the discovery responses and does this mean were going to a jury trial?  Why are they aloud to ask these questions and are we doing the something to Tonya?  I don't understand....

I can't get out of leaving on Thursday, this is a business meeting for work (not pleasure)  I can come Today, Tuesday and Wednesday anytime after 3:30.  I hope that helps

Thanks again,

-Joe

 

Dear Joe,

I'm sorry but I have Mr. Fullenweider scheduled in back-to-back meetings,
hearings and depositions this week.  I might be able to arrange a short
telephone conference today or tomorrow.  Otherwise, his deposition schedule
may clear up on Wednesday and Thursday depending on how the Judge rules at a
hearing tomorrow morning.  If the depositions get reset by the Court, I
could fit you in on Wednesday or Thursday.

I absolutely must visit with you this week about your discovery responses
because I will be out of town next week and they are due next Friday.

Jonda





Good Morning Jonda,

I would like to met with Mr. Fullenweider today if that is possible?  I'm
going out of town Thursday thru Sunday of this week.  I think it is very
important that I speak with him as soon as possible.  Please let me know if
today is good for him.  Thanks again,

-Joe

   Dear Joe,

   Would it be possible for you to come in one  day next week at about 3:00
   p.m. to go over your discovery responses?   Alternatively, you could
   come in two days at 4:00 p.m.  On Thursday, I  leave early for my son's
   soccer practice.  Perhaps Tuesday and Friday would  be good for you???
