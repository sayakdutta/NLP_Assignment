Good Morning,

Are you mad at me or what?  Using an exclamination point and your full name.... I thought it was cool of me to write you last night.  I guess you thought different.  

Anyway, the Longhorns are the worst....Tell you boy Mac he owes me a Grant($50)  and you and I will go double or nothing on the Florida State V.S. Miami!  How does that sound?

I'll talk to you later, have a nice day. (and smile....)

-me




Ask your boss to get you one of these. You're not a part of my cost center!
