Thanks for the e-mail.  I'm excited to come visit in Nov.  However, this "bring your wallet" idea doesn't fit well with my new "I'm a cheap-skate mode". Oh well, what's a few bucks...money well spent to hang with a good buddy London.

Nov 2, or Nov 5 work fine, its upto you.  Well I've got to cut this short, Calpine is out banging on some N-M.

Cheers

Morning sunshine..all is well here in London...doing
alot of looking around and am totally overwhelmed with
the sense of world history with each step taken and
each sight seen...looked at 16 flats to try and find a
place to live on friday, only one is a real candidate
with possibly one other..will know more today on that
front...you need to do one thing when you pack for
your trip to London.BRING YOUR WALLET. ive lived in
chicago, miami, houston, kansas city, seattle and
spent alot of time in both  san fran and las vegas..im
here to tell you no TWO of those cities combined are
as expensive as London standing alone..its unreal!!!
It seems to me we might have a shot at closing on that
friday Nov.2...give me a few more days to get things
cleared up and Ill let you know...if your dying to
hear my sexy voice u can dial direct just as you read
it..011447786844020..it is my new mobile phone..hope
all is well..S
