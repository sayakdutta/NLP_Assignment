John Lavorato already said that he would make JD report directly to Canada.

 

John, one thing to consider with your nat gas org is the reporting of disturnal to john arnold. From my standpoint, this was an unfortunate move and is similar to us losing the east gas desk to Houston. You will want to give this careful consideration, particularly if you are looking to disturnal to trade alberta power options. With the change in leadership we should discuss whether we want to grab disturnal back (solid line reporting) and suggest dotted line to arnold.

fyi - his P&L for accounting purposes continues to roll-up to canada. However, for internal mgmt reporting, his p&l rolls up to arnold.
