Gentlemen,

First, my condolences on your stock price.  All I can say is that I
empathize: AES fell 49% in one day a few weeks ago.  I suspect the market
will bounce back for both our companies before very long.

I attach a speadsheet with slightly revised performance numbers, and per
our last conversation, I have added numbers on ramp rates and start times
to help you better model the optionality.  When the forwards improve (as a
developer, I MUST be optimistic!), you can use this updated information to
update your pricing.  I look forward to resuming our discussions.

Regards,

Derek Denniston
Vice President
AES Calgary
