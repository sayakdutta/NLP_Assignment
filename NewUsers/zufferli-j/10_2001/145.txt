Gentlemen,

Besides the upcoming workshop we are organizing in Calgary, I would like
to bring to your attention some of the software technologies we are
developing for Energy Risk management in Calgary.

Our technology is Modular (multithreaded C++ DLLs) and can be integrated
into yours with great ease.
More generally, the cost of software development is quite lower in
Canada, I would also like to explore the possibility of outsourcing some
of your development: we have a strong analytics team: 3 PhD in Numerical
and applied math (all of us are well established Profs at the
University), and a software team ...

I have included a document describing our products.

Regards,
ali lari lavassani
