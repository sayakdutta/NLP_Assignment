Do you still have the forms for the 4 hourly people (Tyler, John, Mike, Murray). I tried to go into the PEP and get them but it is closed.

My understanding (from HR in Houston) is that Lavo has asked for a list of outstanding reviews.  There's still a chance to slip under the radar if you get your outstanding reviews to me by tomorrow!

Thanks.....
