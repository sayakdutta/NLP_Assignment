nothing new here, when is your flight? have you found any condos yet?

 

hey -- how are things going this week?  any new developments (that are
public -- i haven't read the papers all week as i've been here until 1am
every night)

ali just found out that he got dinged for the 'early rolling round' at
columbia, but they reinvited him to apply for normal rounds in January.
he's really disappointed, because he was most bullish on his chances at
columbia.  i don't get it though -- his gmat and marks are awesome, he has
good work experience (4 years), he has a masters degree, and apparently, he
said the interview went really well.  kinda shitty.  he has an interview
with stanford next week is at least positive.

write me and give me an update (you're bad for keeping in touch!)
