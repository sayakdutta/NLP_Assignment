No I never got the sweater. I was thinking about that on the weekend.  I'll pick up the gift for you.

 

Hey John,

Did you ever get the sweater i sent you?  If so, does it fit?

Also, i know i'm a bit late (i thought the shower was next week) but i
bought Jess a gift at Kacz' Kids.  Could you pick it up for me?
