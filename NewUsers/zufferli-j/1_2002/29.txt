Guys, I got the following approved by Whalley. We should sit down and discuss next steps asap

 


Greg/Louise - I would like your approval for a pool of $$$ to try to get all of the outstanding commercial staff in Canada signed. I would like approval for up to U.S. $250K/$250K to sign up the following "hold-outs":

1) Howard Sangwine
2) Grant Oh
3) Dean Drozdiak
4) Garrett Tripp
5) Steve Burnham
6) Lon Draper

Each of the above are highly marketable and have competing offers in hand. They have also been talking to their U.S. counterparts and know that there are funds available. Please advise.
