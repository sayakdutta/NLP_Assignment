that was our plan but I am not sure whether UBS has the proper Canadian corporate structure to allow to do that yet

 

John,

Can you confirm whether or not you guys had planned to launch physical gas from day 1?

I have forwarded you e-mail to John Zufferli.  I don't know who in Canada had input into the Cdn. Operations timetable but I would have thought we would have wanted some physical day 1.  We have 5 of  8 traders here who are very, very, physical in what they have typically traded.  Hopefully John can give you some further insight.

Chris.

 

Chris,

Do you guys want to trade physical gas (and power?) from day 1?

If so, I note that Cdn. Operations timetable identifies this as a post day 1 item, as they think physical trades will not start until later.

Dave
