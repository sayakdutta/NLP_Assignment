Yesterday I talked with Chelan's trader and she informed me they regard the 7 MW we are delivering to them as a "good" contract.  So long as we are able to deliver, they will accept deliveries.  I'm not sure what this means in light of their termination status, but since the price is $34, I'm going to deliver until I hear otherwise.
