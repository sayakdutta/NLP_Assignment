The 24-26 is OK with me.

 

I am on vacation Oct 5-21st - so I am available anytime between Oct 22nd through 31st.
So Dale I am available for the 24-26th.

 

Great work, team--we took the "total number of trips" category for the Bike Commute Challenge.

As a reward, we will be treated to lunch at Rock Bottom, courtesy of Enron, sometime during the month of October.

We need to pick a day when we can all get together for that lunch.

I propose one of the following dates, beginning at 11:45 a.m.:  

		T	W	Th	F

		16	17	18
			24	25	26


Please let me know which of these dates you CANNOT make.  If you have a strong preference about another date, let me know that, too.  The date(s) with the the highest possible attendance wins.

Let me know what your preference is.
