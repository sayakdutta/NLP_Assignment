Let's talk about the RTO meetings when we get more information from FERC.  If the entire week is only going to be a panel format, I don't think it will be a very good use of Tim's or Sean's time.  In a panel setting, only the panelists are permitted to speak, and the audience can listen only -- participation from the audience is usually not allowed.  
 
Once we get more information from FERC and find out the exact format, we can then make final plans.

This time, I got the subject header right and include the attachment.  
 
 




Here's the notice on RTO Week.  No real details--they say they are forthcoming.
 
Note that Tim Belden and/or Sean Crandall from the West Desk are planning on attending part or all of the week.
