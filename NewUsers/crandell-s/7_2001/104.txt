hey
it changes from day to day.  the number that will get you the closest is 503-464-3917.
so i got back from europe a couple of weeks ago.  went to italy (tuscany), switzerland, france (paris), and amsterdam.  quite cool.  i think now though i'm ready for a beach vacation (hawaii or mexico).  i'm going to go this fall.

hope everything is going well with you.

take care

Sean




Hey Sean, sorry I hung up there. 
I was hoping you could still give me Scott's number, or whoever deals with
odd lot sp15. 
Thanks so much. Hope your doing well.
