Lou's right, I probably won't be able to help answer any questions, but I am 
happy to offer my insights on how to cut his budget.   DF

do we ever end these financial reviews???  i'm on pins and needles waiting to 
be "summoned" to expalin the $10 million "Soldano settlement" and i never get 
a call....

i'll be in montana on monday...any questions about legal, indian row or 
environmental please call drew...he won't be able to help but call him 
anyway...

legal should be in good shape - just let mike know if anything comes up.   
Stan knows the situation on the indian ROW (i asked him how he wanted to show 
it in the budget) . i don't think we have issues for environmental but bill 
kendrick would be in the best position to answer any questions (sorry 
bill)....i'll be in friday morning if you think we need to discuss 
anything....thx
