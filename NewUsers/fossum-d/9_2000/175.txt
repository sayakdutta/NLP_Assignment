Give em hell in the deposition my friend!  If you get the chance, ask them 
how much of that $400 mm they set aside for you!   Hey, we need to talk about 
something else--I'm getting a pheasant hunting trip organized for late Oct.  
Interested?  DF








Lot's of changes here.  Deposition on MHP all day today so probably Tuesday
before calling you.  GO DUKE!!!!  I love that #, though I think they got a
hec of a deal.




Your new boss??? Did you see what Duke paid for MHP??  $400 mm!!!  What
were they smoking?  Give me a line when you get the chance--we're overdue
on getting together.  DF
