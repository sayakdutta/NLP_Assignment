I haven't seen one in a while--please send me the current one.  We are so 
rarely on duty up here in Omaha that it isn't really worth doing for us!  DF

Drew,
Do you get an off-duty report for your folks here in Houston?  I print one 
out about once a month and could send you a copy if you wish.  Please let me 
know.

Peggy
