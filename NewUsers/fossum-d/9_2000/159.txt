P.s., thanks for the offer on the duck lease--I may want to join you 
sometime!  DF

Tell you what, just to make sure I can tell the difference between the lab 
and the Hen, I'll bring my own Lab!  Besides, when I hunted there last, we 
couldn't shoot hens.

PS-- I have my personal duck lease down here that we can also make 
available.  There are overnight quarters if we need them.  (Last year we took 
over 600 ducks off the properties).

Drew - Depends if they can recognize the difference between a Lab and a Hun.  
 We just received the renewal notice for 2000/01.  I recommended to Dave N. 
that we renew the membership.
 I will ask Rosemary to give both of you notice when she gets the approval 
from Dave.
 Once approved we would be happy to help set up outings.  

Thanks.  John
