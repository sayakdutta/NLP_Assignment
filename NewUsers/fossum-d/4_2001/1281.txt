no--golf's great!  df




Drew, just a FYI....I signed you up for golf at the Law Conference for Thursday afternoon....you were out of pocket and Martha said you like golf....I can change it to Skeet shooting or rafting on the Guadalupe if you'd rather do that.....!!!!! Seriously, let me know if you want me to change it....
