Believe it or not, we just received a 25 page cert petition to the Supreme
Court filed by Bath Petroleum.  As you will recall, the Second Circuit's
decision was an unpublished per curiam order.  Even more remarkable is that
Carter  Phillips of Sidlley & Austin signed the petition as counsel of
record.

I will send a copy to Patty.  We can talk next week about our brief in
opposition.
