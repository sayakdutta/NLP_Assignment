Get a dog???  My view on that is why bother getting a dog when you can have 
just as much fun letting the wife and kids treat you like one?  Congrats on 
the hush hush thing--that's great and well deserved!!  Keep watching your 
back--you just became a bigger target!!  DF












bummer.? Sounds like you need to get a DOG.? 

No, not planning to be in DC until March 8-9.? Headed to CA though -- Marina 
Del Ray.? They finally came through with the VP promotion (still highly hush 
hush).? So I am headed to our Winter board meeting in the sun to get the 
treatment.... some kind of hazing thing....

What the hell is going on with you???? I'm bored and lonely--and will be in 
DC on the 20 and 21st.? Any chance of drinking and cigar smoking??? We got 
a nice note from your mom and it sounds like? Rollie is doing great.? That 
was super to hear.? Take care dude.? DF
