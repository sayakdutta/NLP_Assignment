Attached for your convenience find the latest drafts of the Transport Options 
documents.  These documents were sent to our workshop participants late 
yesterday as a means to facilitate our discussions tomorrow.  I suspect we'll 
have small changes to incorporate based on the comments we receive in the 
workshop.  If you have any questions, please let me know.
