I can't wait!  Frank--our expectation is that Staff won't go.  Can you call 
Harris Wood and approach that subject with him.  It was my understanding that 
Staff didn't expect to come, but just in case MGO or Midam have gotten to him 
and talked him into Staff attending, lets talk him out of it.  Thanks.  DF
