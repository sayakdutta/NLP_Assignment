GREAT NEWS!  Over the past few months we've been evaluating other service=
=20
providers to find out if it would be in Enron=01,s best interests, both=20
financially and from a service point of view, to change registered agents. =
=20
We met with the Litigation Unit to ensure that service of process needs wou=
ld=20
be met and, hopefully, exceeded, and we talked with representatives of Enro=
n=20
tax departments re online information designed to assist the tax preparatio=
n=20
procedures.  We tested all aspects of the proposed services to our=20
satisfaction, and we worked assiduously with the successful candidate to=20
ensure Enron-user-friendly websites. We anticipate that there will be a=20
saving to Enron of approximately $126,000 per year which will be passed=20
directly to your cost centers.   After much kicking of the tyres we're=20
terminating our relationship with CT Corporation System in favor of Nationa=
l=20
Registered Agents, Inc. ("NRAI").  NRAI will prepare, file, and absorb all=
=20
costs associated with the Change of Registered Agent.  We anticipate that t=
he=20
majority of Delaware Change of Registered Agent filings will be effective b=
y=20
the end of January but be aware that some other states take several months =
to=20
handle filings. The database will reflect the change of registered agent as=
=20
we receive evidence of filings.  As part of the process a free status check=
=20
will determine the good standing of all Enron entities.  We'll be happy to=
=20
pass these good standing certificates on to the relevant tax departments.

CT Corporation will remain as agent for those historical entities that were=
=20
voluntarily dissolved or withdrawn, and for contracts or agreements where C=
T=20
Corporation was named as registered agent for service of process (unless=20
legal counsel decides to amend the terms.)

NRAI, a New Jersey-based company, was formed 5 years ago by ex-Prentice Hal=
l=20
managers.  It is now the third largest provider of registered agent service=
s=20
in the country.   It has a very strong, modern technology platform that=20
enables it to respond quickly and effectively to its clients' needs, and it=
=20
offers a full range of nationwide Corporate, Uniform Commercial Code and=20
Registered Agent services, and free, unrestricted access to its expansive=
=20
document library containing over 6,000 savable forms, official documents an=
d=20
information charts. =20

We will continue to provide document ordering services as before but for=20
those of you whose staff prefer to place their own orders please ask them t=
o=20
contact me by email so that I can provide access information to the online=
=20
NRAI website so that your department can realize the cost savings we have=
=20
negotiated.  NRAI is offering training in how to use its website; please as=
k=20
your staff to contact me so we can set up a combined training session.

Please let me know if you would like more information on NRAI or on any of=
=20
the services they provide.

Happy Holidays!

Best regards
