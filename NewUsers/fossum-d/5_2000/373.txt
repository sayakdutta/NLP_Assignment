The May ET&S Operations Field Trip is scheduled for May 24 at Gallup, New 
Mexico.   Mike Nelson, Bill Cordes and Steve Harris will be traveling to 
Gallup that morning, and returning later the same day.

On behalf of Mike, I am inviting you to accompany them on this trip.    The 
day's agenda will include an employee meeting, lunch and an opportunity to 
see the new Gallup Compressor Station.

Let me know if you are interested.
