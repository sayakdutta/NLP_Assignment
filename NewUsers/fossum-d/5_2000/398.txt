Hey, the day's slippping away and I remember how yesterday went.  (Remember 
Kimball?)  I have a meeting with MKM and FX from 3-5 on the May 9 meeting in 
KC, so here are my thoughts on the call to Foglar:

 "Hey Murray, this is Drew.  We received the Chisos complaint and I thought 
I'd get ahold of you and see if there is any appetite at Duke to sit down and 
discuss resolving these issues in lieu of spending a lot of money on motions 
in Pecos County"   Grunt.  "I am curious whether the pleading is evidence 
that Duke/Chisos are not interested in resolving this outside the courts, or 
is it just a natural reaction to our letter;  a move to bring Northern to the 
table?"  Grunt.  "Is Chisos serious about litigating this?"  Grunt. "If 
Northern and Duke were to get together in the next 3 weeks, do you think it 
would make sense for Chisos to also attend?  Who do you think Duke would 
send?"  Grunt.  "Do you think Chisos would hold off on serving the petition 
pending discussions?"  

I can't think of much else to say/ask.   jrt
