I'm forwarding to each of you a fascinating document--Langley's proposal to 
the DOE.  It looks like he's already been fairly specific about the interest 
that the tribes will have in the various entities and contracts.  He also 
promised DOE a 10 % power cost reduction (before he even knew what they were 
currently paying).  He may have made some promises that are pretty to hard to 
deliver on.  Developers are amazing.  DF
