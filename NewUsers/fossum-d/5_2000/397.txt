As you are aware, next week we will hold employee meetings in  Houston and 
Omaha.   The focus of these meetings is to have Dave Neubauer and Steve 
Harris  give their commercial updates.  We intend to have both Dave and Steve 
give their presentations from last week's KeyEx customer meeting plus some 
updates as to current  revenue levels etc.

We do not intend to show the KeyEx videotapes at these  employee meetings.  
However, we will make available to each of you, a copy of the  meeting 
videotape to share with your employees at satff meetings or to let them 
review it as time permits.
I will assume one copy is sufficient unless I hear otherwise.  Mike Nelson, I 
plan to get at least 4 copies for you unless you need more for  rotation 
throughout the field offices.

Please let me know!
