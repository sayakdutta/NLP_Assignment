Looks OK to me.  Are you sure the SW Gas point is a primary point for some of 
the Gallup shippers?  I didn't remember that.  If others are ok also, go for 
it.  Thanks. df


   
	
	
		





Here's a draft of a letter asking for expeditious treatment of SWGas's 
application.  Let me know your comments by Wednesday afternoon if possible.  
Thanks.
