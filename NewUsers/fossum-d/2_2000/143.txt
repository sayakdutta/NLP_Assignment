The Houston Backbone team is currently testing and making final updates to 
the connection to London.  We are currently experiencing problems viewing 
options from within IPTV.  Please test the IPTV software with CNBC, as it is 
the only option working right now.   I will let you know when the other 
options are available.  

If you have any problems please contact the Help Desk x7454.

Thanks, Jean
