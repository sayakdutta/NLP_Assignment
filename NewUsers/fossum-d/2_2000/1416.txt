 You all should have received by now a photocopy of the 1998 Compliance 
Report from the Enron Gas Pipeline Group Compliance Committee that may be 
used to report 1999 compliance report activities.  In my January 5, 2000 memo 
to you all, we requested that handwritten comments/updates be provided to my 
attention by February 15th.

 I have yet to receive any such comments/updates.  Please provide any 
comments/updates by the end of this week so the report can be finalized and 
sent to Sharon Butcher within the time frame she requested.  If there are no 
comments/updates, please let me know.

Thanks,

Eric Benson
