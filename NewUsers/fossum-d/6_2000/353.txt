The use of cell phones and pagers has increased dramatically in the past fe=

years.  As a result the Accounts Payable department has seen a rapid increa=

in the number of invoices and vendors.  With the higher volume, we have=20
reviewed our processes in order to continue our rapid payment cycle.

Although we encourage vendors to address their invoices to individual=20
employees, they often mail invoices directly to Accounts Payable.  At times=
=20
they fail to list the individual who uses the pager or cell phone.  In thes=
e=20
cases we return the invoice to the vendor.  If the employee is designated, =
we=20
try to track him/her down and forward the invoice.  The high level of=20
employee movement among jobs and locations at Enron has made this=20
increasingly challenging.  Either way, we end up doing something less=20
productive than paying invoices.

To maintain satisfactory response to our vendors and to reduce time necessa=

for research, we request that employees who have pagers, cell phones, and=

for them by personal check or charge card (if applicable=01*payment instruc=

By submitting these charges on your expense report, you can help us reduce=
