Martha, please print up and sign for me and send.  Thanks.  Robert--this is 
what I'm sending to Emma.  Nothing definite yet, but Soldano might have 
something soon.  I didn't want to raise expectations on that yet.   DF

See attached.  One thing on the letter I am not sure on the procedure you 
used in interviewing her in Houston.  Will check on the VFT order when people 
start arriving this AM and I will get your mail sent overnight to you.  Talk 
with you later.

Martha
