I am obviously not y2k complaint.   The agreement does read as Charlie 
indicated 

? 2.3  TW shall own, operate and maintain facilities. "...capable of 
delivering no less than 200,000 MMBtu of gas per day..." and PG&E facilities 
"...capable of receiving no less than 200,000 MMBtu per day...".

There are also pressure obligations - a minimum delivery pressure of 600 psig 
and a maximum of 700 psig.   

otherwise, there are no volume restrictions...

Charlie is doing some more digging, but hasn't found anything in the 
operating agreement to limit us to 250/d yet (other than the July or August 
99 letter related to '250/d limits until all PCB issues are resolved'..

Mike,

At your request I reviewed the June 27, 1995 Operating Agreement between PG&E 
and TW looking for any volume commitments and found only the following 
reference:

? 2.3  TW shall own, operate and maintain facilities. "...capable of 
delivering no less than 200,000 MMBtu of gas per day..." and PG&E facilities 
"...capable of receiving no less than 200,000 MMBtu per day...".

The Operating Agreement references an Interconnect Agreement between TW and 
PG&E dated 3/16/92.  It does not appear that the Operating Agreement canceled 
or superseded the Interconnect Agreement.  I am trying to find a copy of that 
Interconnect Agreement to see if any quantity language is in it.

Vig, do we have a certificate limit regarding the quantity we can deliver to 
PG&E at Topock?

Charlie
