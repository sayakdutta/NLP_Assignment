fine.  I was going to pass around, but had not yet done so... so I did not 
send them around.

agreed.  It might be best if our next staff meeting we discussed these - with 
appropriate caution...i did pass around a copy of Operations Objectives

I recently provided each of you with a copy of the 2000 Goals and Objectives 
for GPG. At a meeting yesterday Stan asked that we keep these somewhat 
confidential because of the inclusion of the Clean Fuels objective.
