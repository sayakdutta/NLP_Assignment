Today Christine Stokes will be circulating the discount letter for the USGT 
deal to the usual TW personnel for approval.  Since the revenue sharing 
mechanism agreed to by the parties creates a negotiated rate, we will need to 
make the appropriate filing before the April 1 effective date.  

Attached are 3 documents:  1) cover letter (nearly identical to NNG's), 2) 
tariff sheets and 3) a copy of the discount letter for your reference.  (Glen 
and Mary, please put my draft of the tariff sheets into the usual tariff 
sheet format.  I hope the columns line up on my draft  -- if it is confusing, 
let me know and I will fax you a copy.)

Please let me know your comments as soon as possible...preferably by close of 
business Tuesday.  Thank you.
