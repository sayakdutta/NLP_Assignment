I'm having Martha schedule a conf. call to discuss this.  I also want to 
discuss potential exposure if PG&E's public disclosure strategy kicks off a 
round of lawsuits.  Thanks.  DF

Need to continue our look at whether we are in a strong enough legal position 
to "take a stand" or force an increase.

 I spoke to Dan Thomas with PG&E this morning regarding the possibility of 
lifting the flow restriction at Topock. He indicated that they did briefly 
discuss the issue but in light of their current public relations efforts to 
inform the press and policy makers of the current situation they did not feel 
it would be appropriate to increase the limits at this time. However, he did 
indicate that they will be working on some additional "milestones" which will 
allow us to increase flows once they are met .
