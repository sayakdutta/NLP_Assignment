The meeting with Dave has been changed to Houston.   Did you still want to 
participate?  The conference room in Houston has a conference telephone but 
it is not a video conference room.  If you want to meet in an office or 
conference room in Omaha I can conference you in if you are still 
interested.  Just let me know what you would like for me to do.

Thanks,

Tammy

Since both Bill and Dave will now be in Houston, the meeting scheduled from 
10:00-11:00 on March 14, 
will now be held in EB4194.
