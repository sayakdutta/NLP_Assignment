Does this impact MOPS or Seagull situations?

At the meeting this morning, the Commission issued new regulations under the 
Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act for Pipelines on the Outer Continental 
Shelf (RM99-5). 

In a nutshell, the rules add new reporting requirements for offshore pipes  
in order to level the playing field with offshore pipelines that are 
regulated under the Natural Gas Act.  

In an important change from the NOPR, the rule exempts from these new 
requirements offshore pipelines that are already regulated under NGA (i.e. 
there will not be dual reporting requirements).

Commissioner Breathitt explained that while this is a modest step and doesn't 
address all OCS issues, she feels like this  provides a light-handed 
regulatory alternative for regulating offshore pipes.
