Dave, I've had a technical conference come up at FERC on the 20th in a matt=
er=20
that I'm responsible for.  Bill strongly suggested that I go to DC.  Now, I=
=20
may not be a rocket scientist, but I see pretty clearly the wisdom of=20
following Bill's advice.  I've let Mike Moran know and at Bill's suggestion=
,=20
asked him if he'd like a substitute to stand in for me (maybe Lou Soldano?)=
. =20
Judging from the list of participants in this PRC, I assume I was partly an=
=20
ET&S representative and partly a GPG law representative.   I note that ET&S=
=20
is already pretty well represented with Neubauer,  Julia and Mike Nelson. =
=20
Without me, there is noone from law, but our people have already been PRC'd=
=20
anyway.  I'll leave it to you and Mike to decide if my spot needs to be=20
filled with someone from GPG law.  Sorry about this--just one more bit of=
=20
evidence that I "have issues."  DF

You=01,ll note that not all of you have specific managers assigned.  That=
=01,s okay=20
your insights regarding the performance of managers with whom you have=20

feel free to ask another committee member with fewer or no managers for hel=

Finally, for your information Mary Ellen Coombe of EOTT Energy will be=20
