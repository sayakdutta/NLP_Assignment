-FYI--this is the kind of significant organizational change that in the old 
days would have spurred us to dash over to Happy Hollow and drink a bunch of 
beer and pretend to play golf.  Had you guys heard anything about this???  
I'd appreciate your thoughts.  DF

ATTACHED IS AN IMPORTANT ORGANIZATION ANNOUNCEMENT THAT SHOULD GO OUT TO ALL 
GPG EMPLOYEES IMMEDIATELY:

The timeliness and confidentiality of this announcement have made it 
impossible for us to use the Notes Team to handle distribution via e-mail, as 
would normally be the case.  As a result, please forward the message to 
everyone in your respective department(s).

Note to those of you whose departments include field locations:  We are 
sending the announcement to all field locations via burst FAX, so you should 
not need to e-mail copies.  Faxes will be distributed at approximately 10:30 
this morning.

Please call Lisa Costello (x31819) if you have any questions.
