I guess this is good news unless they introduce the "next steps" section at 
the meeting with a slide that is titled "Step One:  Shutting Your Sorry-Ass 
Pipeline Down ONce and For All" .   Seriously, the agenda doesn't seem to 
have any flavor of escalation, which is great given the  lack of attractive 
alternatives for our team right now.  Talk to you about this tomorrow.  DF

Rich,
Attached is a draft agenda for our July 13 meeting.
Most of us will be staying the night of 7/12 at the Holiday Inn in
Flagstaff.  Your directions look pretty clear but if you could send me via
e-mail or fax (415-973-6112) a map that would help keep us from getting
lost.

thanks,
