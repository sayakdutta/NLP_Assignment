Drew, I need to discuss this with you before I fill out the form.  First of 
all it has to be done on-line so I think it is best to do it from your 
machine so I am not the one registered.  Second I need to make your flights 
before I do the form.  We can talk about this on Thursday PM or Friday and 
make the reservations and do the form at that time.

Martha

 

I guess the first form was broken.  df
