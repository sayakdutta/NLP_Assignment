Tell him I'm already migrated to Windows 2000, but that they just havent' put 
outlook on it yet. Maybe that will help.  df  




Drew, I talked to Kelly Strader today about migrating you next week....He is 
having some problems getting that  implemented....I asked him to get a name 
of who can get it pushed through and how badly you need to be migrated and 
he's going to get back with me tomorrow hopefully.  He says they aren't 
migrating anyone right now which doesn't make a lot of sense to me.....Once I 
have a name it might take a call from you ...I'll let you know more...when I 
hear....

 

Emily:  Drew should be totally removed from our CMS system now, and you can 
proceed with getting him transfered to Outlook.

Drew,

I have replaced you with both Dari and Tony in the routing system.  They will 
both receive all CAF's that would have come to you and should be able to 
approve them. 

Dari, Tony - if you have any problems approving let me know.  Unfortunately 
there is not a way at this time to split out north and south deals so you 
both will receive all general counsel level CAF's.   If this becomes a 
problem let me know and I will try to do something for you.  

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  

Thanks

Linda


   
	  	





I need to get on msoft outlook asap and get off lotus notes.  To accomplish 
that, I'd like CMS contract approval emails to go to Tony for the south end 
end and Dari for the North end, for discussion with me orally and approval on 
their computers.  Can we do this??   If not, we need a better system that 
allows me to get off lotus notes.  thanks. df
