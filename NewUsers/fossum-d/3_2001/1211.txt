Since the Assistant General Counsel position is equivalent to Sr. Director 
Legal would have to follow these same guidelines for people that are proposed 
to move from Senior Counsel to AGC.
 
Hayslett, Rod; Corman, Shelley; Prentice, James; Lowry, Phil; Meyer, 
Rockford; Hotte, Steve; Cordes, Bill
Cc: Barbee, Wilson; Fagan, Fran; Sumlin, Roger; Schaffer, Brian; Vaughn, Ann

At the year-end 2000 PRC meeting for ETS, we discussed the Senior Director 
title and criteria for its use.  Attached is a recap of that discussion and a 
proposal for the use of this title in ETS prospectively.  Give me a call if 
you have questions or suggestions for modifications.  I would like to 
finalize the criteria prior to the commencement of the 2001 mid-year PEP/PRC 
processes on May 7.
