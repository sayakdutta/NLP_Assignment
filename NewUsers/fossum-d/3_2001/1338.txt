You probably need to look at this.This only addresses expenditure approval and does not address "execution" authority. Sometimes non VPs believe that if they can approve the expenditure then they can sign contracts in connection with the expenditure even in the absence of a power of attorney. Accordingly it might be wise to expand the "Delegation" section of this policy.

Please review and provide comments to myself and/or Lisa Sutton.

 

FYI, based on comments received, attached is the draft which will be distributed to Stan's direct reports for comments. We plan to have the policy in place before the end of March.
