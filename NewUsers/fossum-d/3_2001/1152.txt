SO SORRY!!  Kim Wilkie and I  are trying to figure out this MOPS mess before 
she leaves for the birth which is soon!!  We were able to get ahold of Mike 
Moran and he was able to give us invaluable assistance and the time just got 
away.  Tony and I will get with Susan for a summary. 
If we do that, does it still go on our "permanent record"?
