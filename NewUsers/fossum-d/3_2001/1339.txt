Would it make sense to have Lee and Bill follow up on this?  I don't know what's involved but hopefully not much.  Lee and Bill, absent contrary guidance from Lou, please handle this.  Thanks. df









Attached are the ETS litigation, environmental, and regulatory issues per our
records documented in accordance with the meeting held last fall.  We are
currently updating these records for our 2000 year-end audits.  Please provide
us with any necessary changes to the issue documentation already recorded as
well as any new information that may not be included.

Please give me a call at 713-646-6530 if you have any questions.  Thanks for
your time.
