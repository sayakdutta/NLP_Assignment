I've asked Fran to reschedule this--sorry.  df




Laura and Fran asked me reschedule their meeting with you and after checking everyone's schedule it looks like 11:30 to 1:00 on Monday is the only time I can get all of you together.    They have reserved EB1136 and are providing lunch so please mark your calendars.

I will be out tomorrow but back on Monday so if a conflict should come up before Monday call Jan Cobden at 3-6044.
