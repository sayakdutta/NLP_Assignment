Drew,

CONGRATULATIONS!!!  It is about time!!!  Dana and I would be glad to assist 
Sandra and you on your relocation to Houston. If you need a place to stay, 
our doors (and pool) are open.  We would also be available to show you 
around.  Also, Dana would love to show Sandra where all the good places to 
shop are ... trust me she knows. 

Let me know when you will be in town. 

Robert & Dana

 



 





Michael Moran, currently Managing Director and General Counsel for ETS, has 
decided to retire after a distinguished 27-year career with Enron.   Mike has 
been a conscience and a statesman of our organization and it is hard for me 
to imagine the ETS organization without Mike.  
 
Fortunately, Drew Fossum, currently Vice President and General Counsel for 
Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern, has accepted my offer to become Vice 
President and General Counsel of ETS effective April 1, 2001.  Drew will 
relocate to Houston and report to me in his new role.
 
To assist with transition issues and special projects, Mike has agreed to 
stay on board for several months as Managing Director and Special Counsel to 
the Chairman and will continue to report to me.   
 
Please join me in congratulating Drew on his new assignment and thanking Mike 
for his many contributions to ETS and Enron.
