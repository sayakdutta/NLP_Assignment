I need an extension--I'll give you any comments I have tomorrow by email.  If 
I have any feel free to blame me for slowing down the process! 



















Attached is the final document with attachments for the Red Rock filing.  
Please let me know by 3 P.M. on Friday (3/23) if you have any comments or 
concerns.   Also, please sign the FERC approval form located at the end of 
the Application and either fax it to me at 402-398-7592 or e:mail your 
approval to me.  (I need this from each group!)  Thanks for your help.  Donna

Please note:  I will be out of the office the week of March 26 -30.  Please 
contact Bret Fritch at 402-398-7140 or Keith Petersen at 402-398-7421 if you 
have any questions during that time.
