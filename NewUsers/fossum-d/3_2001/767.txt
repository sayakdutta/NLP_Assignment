Shit--I knew I forgot something!  My boss leaves for good on April one, so 
I'll be spending 3 or so days a wk in Hou starting now.  I'll be the VP and 
General Counsel of Enron Transportation Services, which is the division that 
runs all the pipelines.  Yeeha.  I agree about getting together--when you 
coming down to visit the sister in law?  Maybe we can run up to MPLS for a 
boondoggle.  Also, I'll be in DC the 22d and 23d of March--where are you?  DF 










Congratulations! 

What is the job, anyway.? Or have you failed to even ask? 

When do you go?? We need to plan a get together. 



 

I got the call today.? Got the job.? I feel like the dog that caught the 
car--enjoyed the chase but don't know quite what to do with the car.? DF
