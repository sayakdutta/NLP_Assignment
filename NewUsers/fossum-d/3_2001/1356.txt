Pheasantsrus???  What a great email address!  I'll hang on to us in case ole' Jim sells us down the river for next year!  Talk to you.  df










This weekend on Tony Dean's Outdoors (the guy from Pierre) they featured a farm near Kennebec.  It is just South of where we were last year.  They appear a bit more organized with dogs and real guides.  I thought you might like their site.  I would guess that they are way more expensive than our guy, reinforcing our sense that we got a good deal.
