Since the Assistant General Counsel position is equivalent to Sr. Director Legal would have to follow these same guidelines for people that are proposed to move from Senior Counsel to AGC.

At the year-end 2000 PRC meeting for ETS, we discussed the Senior Director title and criteria for its use.  Attached is a recap of that discussion and a proposal for the use of this title in ETS prospectively.  Give me a call if you have questions or suggestions for modifications.  I would like to finalize the criteria prior to the commencement of the 2001 mid-year PEP/PRC processes on May 7.
