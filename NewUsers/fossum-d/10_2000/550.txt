Drew, what is our ability to limit their request to interview people that 
report to Keith and Ray, this appears to be more of a fishing expedition that 
specfic questions.   Please let me know--  MK


   
	
	
		






Today, I received a data request (attached) which provides more specifics on 
the interviews to be conducted in Omaha. Please note that they have asked to 
meet with Keith Petersen and Ray Smith on an individual basis.  If the FERC 
deems it necessary, they will interview individuals that report to them.
