Yesterday at the regulatory roundtable it was decided that we should file 
some brief comments in the FERC Sept. 19 technical conference proceeding 
(PL00-1).  These comments are due today & I need to get them to the 
Washington office by noon.

Let me know if you have a chance to read it & have any comments.  Sorry for 
the short notice.
