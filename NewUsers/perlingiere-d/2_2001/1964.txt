I have a few questions re PSNC.

 Are you comfortable w/ Scana as guarantor?
 Which agreement do they want this to cover?  I see they currently have GISB 
and a Master Purchase Sale Spot.

Finally,  if you want to use this form,  I want to included additional 
language to strengthen our position.  As is this is very weak and loose.

Please advise,
