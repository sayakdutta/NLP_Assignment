We are ok with your Addendum to the agreement.  However,  there remains 
Section 3.2,  we discussed earlier.  Because this is interruptible gas we 
prefer Spot Standard. 

Also,  with regards to the signatory.  Is Mr. Roy VP for Atmos Energy 
Corporation?

I will prepare an additional GISB for United Cities.
