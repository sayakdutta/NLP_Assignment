Further to our conversation,  attached are ENA's Special Provisions to the 
GISB along with revisions to certain sections.    With regards to the payment 
guarantee,  in the second paragraph please change "10 days" to  "five 
business days"  where it appears.  For   Section 2.4, please change ENA to  
confirming party, and in Section 3.2 change to  Spot Price Standard.  

Finally,  we  purpose the following language for  Section 10.1.
