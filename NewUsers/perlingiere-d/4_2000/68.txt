 Here is the list of the top 40 with the information pertaining to deals and 
activities. I have made a recommendation of what type of contract or to 
terminate contracts.  I will be out until April 14th. Hopefully by then you 
will be able to get some of the Enfolio's and GISB's out and credit will be 
able to supply to you the final sheets you are missing.
