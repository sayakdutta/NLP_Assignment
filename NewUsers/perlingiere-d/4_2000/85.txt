Good to hear from you.  I saw Lee he said the computer was not working, so I 
haven't tried to e-mail.  Are your aches and pains getting better?

Things are about the same with me.  No great mergers or acquisitions in the 
are of romance.  Miss you terribly.  When do you start treatments, and when 
are you coming back?

I know your dogs are glad you are home!!

Take care and know you are in my thoughts and prayers.
