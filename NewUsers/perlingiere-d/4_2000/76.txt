Rob,

I have researched your question regarding a confirm from ENA for the April 
2000 delivery of 5000 MMbu at 2.77.  This transaction was papered under ENA's 
General Terms and Conditions.   A conformation was sent to Arizona Public 
Service on 3/29.

I hope this clears up any confusion.  If I can be of further assistance, 
please do not hesitate to contact me.

Regards,
