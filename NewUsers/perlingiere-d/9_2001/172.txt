Great!!

 

The one for WIC is the top one - CIG Gas Daily +.10 #1019833.   
The second two lines are the Index - .10  (it's split in 2 lines for their 2 areas of production with different btu factors)
The fourth one is the Gas Daily volume that we are pricing on a daily basis.


I will be in Houston tomorrow and will plan on attending the 10:00 meeting in Gerald's office.

See you then,
Theresa


 

Which one the Kennedy's is WIC?

 

Debra,
Here is the spreadsheet for September confirms.

The green column is Mcf and the purple column is MMBtu at the wellhead.

Also, on Kennedy we are pricing her Gas Daily gas on a daily basis throughout the month so I guess we'll have to send her confirm after the month is over. (or state that the "minus number" is determined on a daily basis)

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Theresa
