Majed and/or Debra,
We have reviewed your comments regarding our Gisb special provisions which
incorporate your provisions.
Attached please find the document with some of our comments.  In particular,
we would like for you to articulate why some of the marked provisions are
outright unacceptable.  I hope that we can work together to create
compromise provisions which will be accetable to all.
Where possible, feel free to suggest alternate or edited language that
solves your objections.
Where entire provisions are unworkable, please give us some indication of
why you have reached that determination.
Also, please find a revised cover sheet atteched as well.
Do not hesitate to contact me to discuss these further.
Thank you for your time and consideration,

Sincerely,

Scott Gladish
