713-646-3491 to my attention.  Many thanks!

 

I will fax you  copy of the Secretary of State Certificate.  I already have
sent the overnight package.  What fax number should I send it to?





 In addition, we also need a letter or other documentation from you
regarding the name change in order to update our systems.

 Thanks
  Dp
