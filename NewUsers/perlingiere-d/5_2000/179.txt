Debra,

We've mistakenly written up an Annex B for the referenced Counterparty as if 
the deal were Financial.  Can you please create the correct Annex B with the 
same Credit Terms as the attached below and forward to Jennifer Blay in the 
Physical Confirmations area?  If you have any questions, please call John 
Suttle.  Correct Deal # is ni3797.

thanks,
Joe Hunter
