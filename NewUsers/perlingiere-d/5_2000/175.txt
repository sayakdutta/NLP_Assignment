PG&E Texas Industrial would like to setup a GISB under HPLC.  We currently 
have one with ENA, and they are telling me that they can not do business with 
HPLC until they get an agreement in place.  Would you please send to Steve 
Kennedy with PG&E Texas Industrial (Fax 713-371-6906) the information he 
needs for him to send us a GISB.

If possible, could we send that today.  If not, tomorrow at the lastest.  If 
that can not happen please call me and give a status so I can call Mr. 
Kennedy and give him an ETA.

Thank you!

Julie
