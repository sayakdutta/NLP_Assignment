With regards to our discussion concerning ENA verses ECC,  the delivery point 
will determine which company to use.  If the delivery point is a border 
point, I will write and agreement for you with ENA.  Also, if the deal is 
made in Houston I can write the agreement.

I hope this is helpful.  Please let me know if I can be of further 
assistance. 

Regards,
Debra Perlingiere
