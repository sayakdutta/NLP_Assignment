You were thanking me too soon for the info on the confirm.
I gave you the wrong information. (Alan Koelemay just called me.  I told him 
that it was my fault and we'll be sending him a new one.)

The price should be:
Inside FERC CIG Index minus $.67 not Gas Daily minus $.55 (that was the 
purchase prices from April.  Which is the month I'm working on for 
allocations right now.  (Not that this falls as a valid excuse)).  All other 
information is fine.

Alan is throwing away the confirm you sent and is waiting for a new one.

My fax # is (303) 534-0552.

I'm sorry for the mix up.  (I'll never take a 2 week vacation again.  I can't 
get myself back into the swing)
