Tammi attached is a redline version of the draft with changes per credit to 
the "Material Adverse Change" found in Appendix "1",   I have also changed 
the date of the agreement.  

With regards to Section "4.7" found in the sample,  this does provision does 
not apply to Texican's agreement and therefore disregarded.
