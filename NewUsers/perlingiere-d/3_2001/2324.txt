Netting.  In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an 
amount in the same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each 
Party may be aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to 
pay through netting, in which case the Party, if any, owing the greater 
aggregate amount may pay to the other Party the difference between the 
amounts owed.
