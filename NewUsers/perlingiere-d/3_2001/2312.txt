Debra,  I have reviewed Markwest's proposed changes to the Master, and given 
the fact that we have since amended the ISDA with Markwest I would like to 
maintain consistency between the two agreements with respect to the credit 
terms.  This being said, I have attached an amended credit worksheet that 
highlights in Red the changes I would like inserted in the Master.  Please 
make these changes.  You will notice that I have increased Markwest's 
collateral threshold to $1MM and have agreed to both of their proposals to 
amend the Third Party Debt and the Collateral Multiple amount.  Also, with 
respect to their request to amend Section 4.2, section (ix), I would like to 
know how they define 'borrowed money' and if this change is going to be 
representative of Markwest, then why is it not bi-lateral.

Thanks
Russell
