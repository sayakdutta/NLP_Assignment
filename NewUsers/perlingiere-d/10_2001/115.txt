3.5. Netting.  In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an amount in the same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each Party may be aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to pay through netting, in which case the Party, if any, owing the greater aggregate amount may pay to the other Party the difference between the amounts owed.



 

 

Debra,
As discussed on 9/19, the e-mail below and attached documents reflect the
final status of the GISB/netting.  I'd like to get this wrapped up and
signed within the next 2 weeks, if humanly possible.  Let me know where we
stand.

Debra,
Now that we have the Master Firm Agreement nearly signed off on, I'd like
to get the GISB and netting agreements in place as well.  Attached below
are the GISB cover page and Special Provisions that my records reflect we
last agreed to.  I'd like to see Enron's new netting agreement because the
netting agreement previously sent to MW is a year old.  If you have no
changes to the GISB cover page and SP, we should nearly be caught up.  I
look forward to receiving the netting agreement from you.  Thanks.
