Should NDR cease to operate, then delivery to the third party would stop.

 

Debra:

Thank you for sending the WMBE letter for payment
arrangements.  But I forgot to ask you about a follow on
a conversation that we had a few weeks ago about any
language in our Enfolio Agreement that would speak to the
unlikely event that should NDR  go out of business that
the enduser would still receive the natural gas that they
contracted with us for.  This questions is very important
at this time as we are negotiating a term deal with a
major utility in the mid-west. Your timely suggestion or
direction would be greatly appreciated.  You can call me
at 301-516-1636 or by reply e-mail.

Thank you,
Rickey Hart
