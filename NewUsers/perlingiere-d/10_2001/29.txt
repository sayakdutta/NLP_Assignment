  Shary,

Regrettably we are unable to use your letter  regarding the amendment to
the GISB.  In that regard I have enclosed our Amendment for signature.
Please sign two Amendments and return both to my attention for final
signature.  I will  forward a fully executed Amendment for your records.


 

Regards,
