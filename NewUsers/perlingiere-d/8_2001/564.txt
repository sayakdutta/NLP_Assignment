 

Further to our conversation regarding long term deals extending into 2004, please see the attached draft of a Master Agreement between Enron North America Corp. and WPS Energy Services, Inc.  We would like to have the three transactions at issue confirmed under a Master.  Please give me a call at your earliest convenience to discuss any questions you may have regarding this matter.
