 Kathy attached is a revised amendment concerning "counterparty".  If you have not  revised and executed the amendment, please have the attached signed.  As you know, PG&E is defined as "Company" in Section 2.4.  Please send the executed amendments to my attention at the address below and upon ENA's signature I will forward an original for your records.
