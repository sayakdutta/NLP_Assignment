Debra,
Here are the negotiated terms for Enfolio. Please note the Credit Matrix for the thresholds and the changes in MAC provisions. I have removed the Financial Covenant clause and have changed the rating event from BBB+ to BBB-. 
If there are any questions, please call. In addition, this should be the final (execution copy) of the contract, so please bring the document for Credit's initials prior to sending.
