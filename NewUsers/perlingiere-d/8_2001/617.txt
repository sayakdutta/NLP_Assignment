How about Friday?

 

I may go walk tonight or tomorrow, but as I said before, it probably would
not be until 7:00 or 7:30.  Let me know if you decide or you could just give
a ring (297-1875 as you probably remember) if you make a last minute
decision and see if it works for both.





Did not go out because of the heat and not feeling well. Would like togo
one night this week.

   How are things?  Did not see you out walking.  I was pretty busy over
   the
   weekend myself.

    We did not go out due to heat. Maybe one evening at the end of the
   week?

      I will NOT give out my #.  I have not been, hope to go this fall.

         Have not gone yet, but planning to in October.  Jo Ellen and Bob
   are
         coming
         down and we are planning to drive out for about a week.  Should be
      fun.
         Charlotte and Bill are going to visit in September but we probably
      will
         not
         go much further than San Antonio.  How about you?  Are you going
   or
      have
         you
         been?

         I did not understand your message about your phone number.  You
   will
      or
         will
         not email it?


         

                           

         Are you going to N Mexico this year?  I will not give my number
   out
      over
         the net.  So email

            You can give me your home phone too if you would like in case
      there
         is a
            good chance with short notice, OK?


            

                                    

            I am not playing the game this year,  thanks anyway.  Regarding
      the
            dogs,
            why don't you email someday that is good for you and we can
   meet.
         Tiz
            cannot take the heat and I will leave him behind, but Gen
      desperately
            needs
            to get out.

               Do you need St. James Place and/or Illinois Avenue?
