Concerning ProLiance,  we have tried in the recent past to negotiate with 
much difficulty a Master Gas Purchase Sale Agreement  with this customer.  
There are significant credit and legal issues surrounding  ProLiance.   Enron 
Credit has refused to grant a line of credit as a result of these issues and 
will not ok a GISB.     In addition,  ProLiance has proven to be most 
unreasonable with regards to terms in the Master.   

Please give Russell Diamond or I a call if you have any questions and or 
comments about ProLiance.
