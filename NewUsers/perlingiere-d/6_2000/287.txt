Please give me some information regarding the gas contracts referenced in 
your e-mail. Are you working with Brant Reves in credit?  I am unclear as to 
the "gas contracts".

Thanks!

Do you know what this is about?  Credit says we have a $100MM guarantee from 
this company guaranteeing their entities including the one named in the 
guaranty.

     Attached for your review is a guaranty agreement from Aquila Energy.
Please let me know if this is acceptable.  Also, gas contracts are ready for
execution, will you be initialling them  prior to execution?

     Thanks.
