Debra,

I'm not sure we wouldn't prefer to have it kept as Houston Pipe Line
Company.  We have been filing with the regulatory bodies all expenses under
HPL, since November of '99.  So, what I would like to have happen, even if
it was a mistake, is have the contract assigned to HPL.  This will keep our
records with the PUCT and FERC the same.  In either case, I will still need
documentation in our contract files to show the assignment.  I appreciate
your help, and please let me know what your thoughts are on this matter.
