Tracy,

Enron North America Corp. does not cover trades with Enron Canada.  For gas 
delivery in Canada, you should consider an agreement with Enron Canada.  

Also,  for long term firm transactions with ENA, you should have a Master 
Agreement.  I hope this clears up any confusion.  If not, please give me a 
call.
