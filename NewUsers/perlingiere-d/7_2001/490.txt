  Regarding SJ,  the Master Gas agreement as drafted and sent to the customer included a Gty to ENA for 7mm.  As stated below, Darren has requested a Gty from SJ to ENA for 8mm that covers physical gas and financial trades.  Have they sent us a gty or are your drafting one?  In any case please let me know.  I need to revise my draft and secure a copy for use as an exhibit to my Master.

Thanks

This is a new worksheet for South Jersey. The threshold has been adjusted down to allow for financial trading under an ISDA(also working on that worksheet). Ann Koehler, in the financial legal group, was drafting language for amending the current incoming grty to include swap language. I am uncertain as to whether the amended grty can be applied to both contracts. If so, we need to have it increased to $8MM and indefinitely extended. Please coordinate with Anne.
