I was away June 29th and July 1-10.

 

That was in reference to the last pay period.  What dates were you gone for vacation?  Thanks Miss Sunshine!

 

I have no exceptions other than vacation, thanks!!!!!!!!!

 

Debra,

I forgot to get your time from you before you left for vacation, so I have entered straight regular time for you.  Please let me know if you have any exceptions, and I can make retro corrections one pay period back. Hope you are having a great vacation. Thanks!
