 Thank you for your e-mail.  I have been away on vacation and apologize for the delay.  I am drafting the agreement this afternoon and anticipate sending a draft via  e-mail  later today.

Best regards,
Debra

 

Debra,

I was just checking on the status of the Kentucky Utilities and Louisville Gas and Electric contract.  Is there anything I can assist you with from LG&E?
