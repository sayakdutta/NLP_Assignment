i heard this yesterday!  perfect example of the state of our economy!




Sweet....













If you bought $1000 worth of Nortel stock one year ago, 
it would now be worth $49. 

If you bought $1000 worth of Budweiser (the beer, not the stock) one year
ago, drank all the beer, and traded in the cans for the nickel deposit, you
would have $79. 

My advice to you is to start drinking. Heavily.
