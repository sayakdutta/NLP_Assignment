I also talked to the manager of the East region scheduling group and he said he would have HR call you for a screening interview, so be ready.  Call me anytime after about 11.




Thanks Tori! I filled out the internal ref. form today.
I'll try to call you tomorrow to follow-up, I've got a few
questions and I'd love to hear your ideas.

Regards,
Fritz
