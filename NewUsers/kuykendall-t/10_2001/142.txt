david - where are we on this?  is there any hope of getting this done?

 

Tori,

	I just wanted to let you know that we haven't forgotten about you.  Kim Alexander who has really been the authority on the pricing information was involved in an auto accident this previous Sunday.  He'll be returning to work next Wednesday and would be able to complete this much faster than anyone else trying to pick it up.

I'll keep you informed next week as to how it goes.

Thanks for your patience,

Dave

I sent this message to colin originally and, since he's out, I am forwarding it to you.  I'm not really sure who the appropriate person is.  I also just realized that I forgot to 
include the attachment on the original message - oops.  Anyway, could you take a look at this sheet and let me know what you could come up with?  
I'd like to build something that looks like the "price sheet" tab. Thanks.

This is a spreadsheet that we used to have in our fundies packet a while back.  It is no longer being maintained, but I was wondering if you could cook something up that looks similar to it -- linking to the fundies price database.  Let me know.  Thanks.
