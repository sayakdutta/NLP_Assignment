that works for me





OK guys - I need help deciding what gift to get for the shower.  Jennifer's
registry can be viewed on the internet at www.babiesrus.com.  I was
thinking we could get her one of the more expensive items since there are 5
of us pitching in.  Susan suggested the 3 way pack n' play portable playard
-- sounded good to me.

Let me know what you think.  My plan is to go pick something up next
weekend.

Thanks.

Dana

See updates in the food section.




I'll keep track of the gifts while Tripp opens them.




Thanks for all the updates:




Please see updates:

Suzanne, FYI regarding the music, Susan said you can always switch on a
Satellite TV Music station--she has at least 20 according to type (Jazz,
Classical, etc.--you and Scott probably have the same thing). But, I also
know you guys have a fabulous collection of CDs.


List of Action Items

*    Buy and send invitations including directions to Susan's place by
October 22nd (We decided to have it at Susan's because Tripp is planning to
invite 15-20 women; Chris' and my place would be tight for that many to sit
together.) -- Pam (Susan created a beautiful PowerPoint invitation that we
may use; I will take care of this item though, so I can field RSVPs etc.)

Hey there! Hope you all had a great Labor Day Weekend. We sure did.

I wanted to get the ball rolling with Tripp's shower. Below is a list of
action items we will need to do.
1) Let me know if I need to add any items that I may have forgotten.
2) Please sign up for what fancies you. (Keep your receipts and we will
divy
costs at the end.)
I will resend the list with updates as I get them.

Hello Ladies!

I've talked to all of you and you all have expressed interest in
co-hostessing (if that is a word) Tripp's baby shower. I just wanted to
send
out an initial email to let you know where we are and a date.

*    After perusing a calender and talking with Tripp, the planned date
is Saturday, November 10th. (I know the time between Thanksgiving and New
Years is crazy for everyone and right after New Years is cutting it close
since Tripp is due Jan. 20th plus or minus 2 weeks.)

*    It will be a brunch (11-1ish).

*    Tripp will send me an invitation list around October 1st.

*    At this point, Tripp is undecided on whether it will be just a girls
shower or a couples shower.

*    Tripp is thinking that it may be about 15 people max.

*    The default venue will be my place; however, Susan has offered to
use her place which I may need to take her up on because our living room is
really only good for 10 people max. Susan are you still okay with that?

As we get closer, I will send out a list of things we need to do and let
you
pick what you want to do. Or let me know before then if there is anything
you are dying to do.

See you soon!
