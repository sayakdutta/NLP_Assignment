Hey..

The ISO forced balanced our PORTFOLIO for SUNDAY. They shifted EES load from SP15 to NP15 with Congestion and paid a lot of Congestion in the process. The Amounts are in The PGE3 LOAD zone under EES2. The amounts are as following.

HE8	8
HE10 	5
HE14	46
HE15	40
HE16	40	
HE17	44
HE18	40
HE19	24

Could you please make sure to charge EES with the congestion charges and not RT.

Thanks.
Geir
