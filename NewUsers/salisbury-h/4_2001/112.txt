HE 01 78 MW to APS  (APS took the power)

Then for HE 3-6  the power was sent to PACE for the original deal price at PV.

John at PACE was going to leave good notes to his prescheduler about this cut. I did not do anything HA to manage the cut (in enpower, Lotus notes ) as JOhn at PACE did not consider this a HA cut but a DA cut that nobody knew about. We left it up to the preschedulers to agree on this cut.

if you have questions ask me,
Monika
