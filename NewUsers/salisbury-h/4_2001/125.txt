I am interested in three tickets per game and would like to attend from five to ten Beavers games and one to two Timbers games.

Thank You,
Holden

Trading, Origination, Asset Services, and Community Affairs have purchased a box suite (17 seats) at PGE Park.  This entitles these groups the opportunity to have a total of 17 people attend each home Beavers and Timbers game.  The Enron PGE Park Committee (comprised of some employees from the groups above) is working together to ensure equitable distribution of tickets so that everyone on the floor will have an opportunity to attend games. 

In order to allocate tickets in the most beneficial way to those who are interested, please respond to the following questions by Monday afternoon, April 30.  If you would prefer to reply verbally, stop by Debra's desk and she will write them down.  Debra also has information about the games if you have questions.

Are you interested in attending any Timbers soccer games?  
If yes to Timbers games, about how many games would you like to attend?  
If yes to Timbers games, how many tickets would you be interested in getting?

Are you interested in attending any Beavers baseball games?  
If yes to Beavers games, about how many games would you like to attend? 
If yes to Beavers games, how many tickets would you be interested in getting for each game?

If you have no interest in attending Beavers or Timbers games, please let Debra know.

Keep in mind that there must be at least one Enron employee with guests.  Tickets cannot be given away or sold.  Contact Debra if you have any questions.
