The prices on deals  683397 were 672851 changed and the deals now need to be autoscheduled.  Can one of you please take care of this?  If a price is changed outside of a certain window, the deal then needs to be autoscheduled in order for it to go to Unify.  Gwen Williams will submit a DMS entry for these deals.
