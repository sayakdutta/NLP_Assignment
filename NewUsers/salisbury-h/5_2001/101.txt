HE 23 - 27mws
HE 24 - 28mws

We are long for these two hours tonight.  Please sell this length at Palo and notify IID of the schedule.  They are aware that it is going real time.  The schedule is IID generation with an EPE generation exchange so it is sure to be a problem.  Please make the deal under STSW and link it to enpower deal numbers 587854 and 591302.

Please call me at 503/807-5669 if you have any questions.
Thank You



 The original path was IID(G)PV(EPEXCHANGE)-BPENERGY-PNM-EPMI-CISO for 50 mw's lightload, we were cut HE 23 by 27mw's & HE 24 by 28mw's.  Please refer to EPMI tag number 21935.  We were unable to find a buyer for the 55 mw's of length we now have.  We spoke with everyone in the upstream and they agreed to settle this schedule real-time.
