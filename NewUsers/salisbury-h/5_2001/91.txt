I would like to keep my current leather type chair.

Thanks,
Holden

On Monday, June 4 and Tuesday, June 5, we will be replacing any desk chair that is currently not a 'mesh'  Aeron chair.  If you are happy with your current chair and do not wish to have it replaced or have special requirements, please let me know as soon as possible.

Thanks!
Amy
