To Radonna or responsible party:
 
I would like to give my 30 days notice to move  out today.  Please let me know if you need any further information than  given.  Our address is 3354 SW Beaverton-Hillsdale Hwy, tenants are  Holden and Tamara Salisbury + family.  We have our new house on June 1st  and would like the opportunity to recoup our June rent.  Please let me  know the best way to accomplish this.  I can be reached on my cell phone  if you have any questions.  The number is 503/807-5669.  Radonna  informed me that email would serve as a valid form of written  notice.
 
Thank You,
Holden
