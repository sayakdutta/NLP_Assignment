notice


REGARDING THIS TEST, A QUESTION HAS ARISEN ABOUT ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN
SHOULD ANOTHER (NONTEST) UNIT TRIP DURING THE PERIOD WHEN AGC IS
SUSPENDED FOR THE TEST.
The CMOPS Chair, the Test Director and WSCC Staff discussed this
question and all are agreed that the control area(s) affected by
tripping of a unit not intended as part of the test should return AGC
to service and attempt to meet DCS requirements.

notice


To all WSCC Control Area operators

This is the 7 day notice of WSCC System test on May 8, 2001
for the proposed Frequency Responsive Reserve (FRR)
 Operating Policy obtaining the system response information
 under the existing MORC spinning reserve policy.

The WSCC is proposing changes to the Operating Reserve policy
 that would change Spinning Reserve practices to newly proposed
 Frequency Responsive Reserve (FRR). The new policy specifies
 the minimum MW component of FRR that should be achievable in
 60 seconds. A Summer(Fall) test is also being planned for June 7.

**
During the generator dropping tests all WSCC Control Areas are to
 suspend AGC 3 minutes prior and restore 4 minutes after the
 generator trips.

This is to have unhindered governor response throughout the system.
**

The test sequence is similar to the June 2000 WSCC System Test

WSCC Frequency Responsive Reserve (FRR) generator dropping test
 May 8 (light loading)

All times are in Pacific Advanced Time (PAT) and are subject to change
 when the tests are finalized.

instructions in
the April 16, 2001 letter e-mailed to the WSCC Area coordinators.
