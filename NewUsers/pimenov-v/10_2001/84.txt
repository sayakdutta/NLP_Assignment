Constance,

I was on vacation from October 4th to October 19th and I didn't submit my timesheet yet. I tried to do it on the HRonline web-site, but the procedure is too complicated.
Is it possible that you or somebody else in the HR department mark the vacation time?
I would really appreciate that.

Thank you.

It's That Time Again!



This memo is a reminder to log onto eHRonline and complete your timesheet.

Remember, you only need to submit your time if you have exceptional time, i.e., vacation, sick, holiday, etc., 
or if your rotation information has changed.  Enron does not track overtime for Analysts and Associates.

Thank you for your cooperation.
