Hi everyone!

Dave's birthday is on Saturday, November 3rd and we would love for you to
join us.  We are planning to eat at Buca di Beppo on the Buffalo Speedway.
I have reserved the Pope's Table for 9:00 p.m.  If you would like to come,
please RSVP.  Feel free to invite whoever you want to come along.
Here is a map to the restaurant.
