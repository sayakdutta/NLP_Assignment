Hello to everyone.

I hope each of you can make it tomorrow, but if you can't I hope we can still keep in touch.  I'd love to have your address, email (external), birthday, and phone number. I'd also like to thank each of you for your friendship during this past year.  It has been great working with you!  Peace and blessings to all.

Alejandra
