Alejandra, that's definetely shouldn't be in my book.

Great catch!!!

 

Vladi:

Please take a look at deal 942732.  It's a deal that was booked today (10/31) for December delivery. It was booked in July, but it's on CGT/Appalac, and since this is not one of your points I don't think it belongs in your book.  Please let me know.

Thanks,
Alejandra
