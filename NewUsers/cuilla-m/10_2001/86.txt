Jason,
Hey man just wanting to see what's going on. From what I've heard you've 
been doing an okay job with my P&L. Only been able to check the market a 
couple of times-it doesn't look like too much has happened. How's the Mid 
Continent? Can't wait to get back-I hope you didn't take my job back. I'm 
here at the London School of Economics and their sytems won't aallow me to 
get on enrononline. Well, have a fun trip down to Beaurevage(sp?) see you I 
guess on Tues.(I'll be there Mon) Tell Martin not to lose all of that P&L 
you made me seeing how he is trading on triple coupon day.

Later,
Denver
