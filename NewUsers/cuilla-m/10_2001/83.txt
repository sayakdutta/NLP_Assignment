Martin,

Coral Energy Canada is billing ENA for 3 deals for the production month of Sep-01.  However, I cannot find anything in the system which matches these deals.  Upon contacting Coral, they have stated that you are the trader on each of these deals.  The Coral Energy Canada trader is Shane Lee.  The detail for these deals is below.  Please advise as to where they might be in the system or what my next step is to be so that I may settle this account.
