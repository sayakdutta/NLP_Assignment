Stephanie - please make sure this gets rebooked and confirmed at a trade directly between ENA and Direct Energy

Cc: Oh, Grant; Boulanger, Patricia


Martin, the deal I mentioned to you this morning is #113186.  Presently we are buying from you and selling to Direct Energy Marketing Limited.  We need to step out of this deal and have you paper the trade between ENA and Direct.  If you require any information regarding this counterparty or contact information, please contact Grant Oh in our office.
 
Thanks
Laura
