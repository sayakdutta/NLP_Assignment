i talked around and letter not necessary and refund takes 2 months so still have some time





1.  Follow up letter to the folks you spoke with yesterday re nice to meet
with you, etc.
2.  When you get a minute, can you please follow up on the $165 refund we
were suppose to be getting back due to our flood survey?
