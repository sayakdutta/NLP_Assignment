I talked to both Carmax and Honda and basically all we need to do is go in (before 5pm so Carmax can talk to Honda) and bring your info for the loan.  They call Honda and get a payoff which is $4050.10 and then cut us a check for the difference.  We should probably do that about 4pm on the 13th then we can go pick up the Lexus from Dorland.
