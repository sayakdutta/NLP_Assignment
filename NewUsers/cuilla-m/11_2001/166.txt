 	 Scientists kill mice with dance music

Scientists who forced drugged mice to endure fatal doses of loud dance music have been accused of " despicable" cruelty by animal welfare campaigners. 

The study by Cambridge University examined how loud music strengthens the harmful effects of methamphetamine, the drug commonly known as speed. 

Wendy Higgins of the British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection, said: "These sick experiments are absolutely despicable. Just because people choose to take drugs and go to raves doesn't justify subjecting animals to suffering and death in a laboratory." 

The scientists, who used a total of 238 mice in the experiment, concluded that loud music strengthened the toxic effects of methamphetamine in animals.
