Veronica,
 
Can we stop this direct deposit or will he need to fill out a form to do so?
 
Thanks

Please assist w/the following and let Martin know when you have completed.  Thanks much.



I have a direct deposit from my paycheck to the credit union for my car payment.  On Friday, I paid off my loan and effective my November 15, 2001 paycheck would like to stop the direct deposit to the credit union.
 
Thanks,
