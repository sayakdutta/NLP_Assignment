Have you had a chance to look into this?  Robert Hills with KCS is wanting payment for this deal.  Thank you.

Martin,
	This Sitara deal #270180 ends in June 2001.  However, I received an invoice from KCS for July production at meter #36381.  At Edwards #2-19 they are invoicing me for a total of 62 MMBtu, and at Russell #1-20 they are invoicing me for 124 MMBtu.  Should this deal have been extended to include July, or is there another deal out there?  These deals do not show up in Unify.  Please advise.  Thank you.
