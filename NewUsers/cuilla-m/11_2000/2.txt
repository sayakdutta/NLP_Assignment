Looking at Earnings estimates I think they are under estimating the long term 
shift in natural gas prices.  90 days ago they had next year earnings $.17 
under this year
and only resently have they started to raise 2001 earnings to account for 
were prices are.  I image that are still under estimating next year earnings 
based on where
the strip of natural gas is.  I don't think most people expected gas next 
summer to be trading over $4.55
