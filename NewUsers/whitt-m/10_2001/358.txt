You know that ENA sold our pipeline assets to Northern Border Partners in Q3 of 2001.  That is what became Crestone.  The list I gave you is of who we do business with now.

 

Thanks, Mark. We have Bear Paw on our list - will check on the others.

 

Enron North America does transactions with the following companies which may be considered Enron Affiliates:

Crestone Energy Ventures
Bear Paw Energy
Lost Creek Gas Gathering

All three companies are primarily gas gathering companies.
