That should keep you busy!




Let me know when your in town.  I will do the same when in Denver.  I guess you heard we bought Can. Hunter.  Another 500+/- per day to sell up North.  FYI




I suggest that you build a boxing ring in the back yard!  Let's try to get together soon.  Sounds like we have both been too busy!




He weighed 8.8 out of the box (I will never admit to saying that).  He then lost back to 7.2 while in ICU but is back on track to 9.2 after three weeks.  He may have a chance.  Lance, the middle man, is one bad mother fro!!!  He takes Luke tot he mat daily just fro sport.  I'm going to have to let Luke defend himself soon - currently we have been telling him he can't hit Lance, but Lance pushes him on a daily basis - must have gotten that from his mother!!

How much does Logan weigh?  Does he stand a chance against his brothers?




Both mom and baby (Logan) are doing much better




How is the little one?  I'm sorry I missed the date!




I missed being there!!!




I don't know why it did not go.  It was huge!  He called it within 15
yds. and took it with a bow.  We missed you in Jackson! Weather was
great, so was the fishing.




Mark - whaaaa sup.  I did not see an attachment - was it big????
