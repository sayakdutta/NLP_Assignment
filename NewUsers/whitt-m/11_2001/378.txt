Plan on a couple of hours.  I am not sure about lunch.  I may already have plans.





Having major problems with my server for some reason.  Can't stay connected. 
  9:30 sounds great.  How much time should I plan on spending down there?  
Planning to take me to lunch as well, or is this strictly a business 
meeting?  Thanks again....Christina
