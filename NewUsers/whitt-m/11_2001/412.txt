It's up to Paul Miller

 

The only other thing would be if you wanted to add intrastates systems (like OTTCO) and then the pipes at either end of I-80 like Trailblazer, KM, PSCO, KRGT, NWP, Overthrust, and Questar.

 

Am I right about the WIC, CIG and Williams?

 

I'll chat with Paul and take care of it.  We have stopped getting access to Dwights outside of the Rockies, so I am looking for production data from other sources.  As soon as I get something reliable, I will update the production maps and get copies to you.

Do you guys have a map showing the interstate grid for the 1-80 corridor?
