Notice on the tags when we go hourly could be 30 minutes or less.   Additionally, if we use them as sink when we go hourly, they will have to be part of the day-ahead tag.   If these issues are not crystal clear with them, I have no interest in even showing an offer.

 

TEA is ok with allowing hourly scheduling from either internal units or to the border, as long as Enron is handling all scheduling and tags and gives sufficient notice for schedule changes.  I assured him that we would handle those functions.  So, we need to offer for: 
	1)  June-Sep'02, 20MW, 5x16
	2) Cal'02, 20MW, 5x16

We need the hourly option to allow for non-GTC sources, but we will deliver into-GTC border hourly.

 

TEA will let us go hourly 5 times per month and change the source if we go hourly, as long as the source remains a unit on the Ga-ITS.  However, he doesn't want a full 50MW block in the June-Sept period, just 40MW.  The 40MW is actually already at the high end of his range (needs 30-40MW for June-Sep).

 

Will he let us go hourly at least 5 times per month and change the source if we go hourly.   This essentially would require they provide parking and lending for up 20 MW in the Cal and 40 MW in the June-Sept.   Can we at least get a 50 MW block in the June-Sept period?


 

An offer from any Scherer unit(s) would work.  He understands the odd lot will demand a premium, but I can't talk him into a round 50MW.  So, 2 pieces of energy: 
	1)  June-Sep'02, 20MW, 5x16
	2) Cal'02, 20MW, 5x16



 

Ask him if Scherer 1,2,3 and/or 4 would work?   Let him know that an odd lot would command a $2.50-3.00/Mwh premium on top   In addition, even if we used Scherer, it would be from any one of the facilities therefore the transmission would need to be able to use any of the Scherer units as a source.

 

TEA is looking to buy 20MW, 5x16, June-Sep'02, into MEAG.  Also looking to buy 20MW, 5x16, Cal'02, into MEAG.  I told them we may be more willing to offer into GTC.  His response was he would need to know which facility or interface would be the source (I suspect this is so he can reserve ahead to use his network transmission).  

Any interest?
