I'll pay the extra $'s.   I would like No. 480 in the new garage.

 

Kevin,

I spoke to Louis Allen...he is sending over a fax of the reserve spot for you...however, I was not sure if you new that you will be paying an extra hundred dollars for the spot.  Please let me know what you want to do.

Thanks
