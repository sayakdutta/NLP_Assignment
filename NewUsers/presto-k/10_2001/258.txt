Late afternoon.   Have Fletch and myself interview.   He has already been in here for one interview.

 

Yes,

Placed a call to him today to setup an interview.  Any times work better for you and the rest of the crew ( late afternoon or early morning 5:30am)?  

 

John,

What about Eric Benke?   Did you review his resume?

 

Kevin,

I didn't work with Ravi directly, however I believe he is extremely well qualified based on his experience. He would likely be a good asset for the group however I do not know exactly in what role (perhaps mid marketing or orig. or as a quant/trader).  What I am not sure of is if he wants to trade.  I will talk to him today and will get back to you.


 

Your thoughts on this guy for SE cash and/or term spread trader?

 

Folks Ravi looks like a real strong candidate that we should consider.

He could be helpful in the Ontario market as well.

Thanks.

 

Hi, LLoyd, thanks for your time and information. Here is my background information.  I will check with John Suarez and others to get an idea of the scope and depth of the opportunity and will give you my response ASAP.  In the mean time, if you want me to talk to other please let me know.
