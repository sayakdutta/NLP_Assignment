Please follow-up with this gentleman.   Never know.

 

Kevin --

I received this note from the EES Business Center.  Can someone from your shop follow-up?  I called this gentleman and couldn't get a definitive answer related to how the power is being generated or how much.  This may be a wild-goose chase.  I'm just not sure.
