TJ has my calender.   Just about any afternoon will work with this group.

 

Kevin,

Let me know your availability (and whoever else you think needs to interview him) and I can setup phone interviews.

We'll go after him.

 

Yes - good guy.  I think he is moving with Marcello into their new cross commodity group.  But he's bright, agressive and worth trying to get.

 

Do you know this gentleman.   Suarez is high on him.

 

Kevin,

I have worked with this guy at EBS for the past year and think he is a good candidate for the group.  He has worked for Marcello Romano (he has a favorable view of him also).  He traded oil products at Goldman a few years back and is interested in coming to the U.S. from our London office.  

Let me know what you think.  Perhaps Louise can weigh in also if she knows him.  

John
