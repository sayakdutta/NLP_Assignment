Lloyd,
 
Hi.  I wanted to let you know that I have another offer that requires a response.  I am very excited by Enron and the opportunity to trade power.  However, I need to know where you stand in the hiring process.  Please give me a call (713) 533-9883 as soon as you have a minute.  I look forward to hearing from you.
 
Sincerely,
