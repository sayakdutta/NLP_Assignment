I would have interest if you package together 50-100 MW of these small units to create a more liquid block of power.

 

A few more details on this.  This is a 15MW QF on the FPC system.  They are offering 7x24 energy, 3 yrs. beginning 4/1/02.  The facility is near Tallahassee, but on the FPC system.  He said he would guaranty 80% availability off the unit.  The best bid he has on the table currently is $29.  When I run 80% availability on the model, your MID is $29.18 ($31.98 MID for Firm LD--for comparison).

Any interest in this product?
