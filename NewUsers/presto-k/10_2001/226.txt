Are all of these units in our database?

 


Please review the attached worksheet listing Transmission and  Generation additions. I have highlighted in green several
missing data items and/or date updates. Please provide the  information for the facilities belonging to your company.
 
There is also a question highlighted for the Rowan  unit.
 
I need your response as soon as possible. This data is due to  NERC on Friday.
 
 
 
Thanks!
