Thanks.   Sounds like you are having a blast.   See ya on Sunday.   How about them Canes.

 

Hey Kevin- 
I am doin really good, having lots of fun.  We went to the game today, it was SO COLD!!  We were on the 50 yard line right there on the field, the first row it was SWEET!!  I won $200 too because I guessed the score right on.   
About the keyboard, I'm not sure it still has a warranty i will check when i get back. 
Seeya, 
Matthew
