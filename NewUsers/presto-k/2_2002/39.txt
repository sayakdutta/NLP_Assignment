Could you meet with the son of a client on the captioned item?  He'll be here the week of Feb 11th; I'm out of town.  I

don't yet know the dates.  He is Eric Fabrikant, son of Charles, Chrm & CEO of Seacor Smit (NYSE: CKH).

Eric wants to be in the Energy business and is meeting several exec's that week.  Yes, you could be one.  I would

appreciate your help.

Best regards,
