If I picked 6102, why am I getting 6103?

Yes...you picked 06102...I will get your things from down stairs.  Looks like they are ready to move in the attorneys now.

Is this the office I selected?    Please confirm.

Here are the office locations that Louise has assigned: 

Calger  06105 
Presto  06103 
Shively 06102 

T Jae, it was decided today that legal will move over here this weekend.  Can you please arrange for Kevin's things to be boxed up so legal can move in downstairs over the weekend.

Ina, if there are any of John Arnold's personal effects left on 5 can you please have them boxed up? 

If we can hold off until next week to set the new offices up I'm sure that Darren and David would be very grateful! 

Thanks for your help!
