My guys are telling me that all of the broker sheets we collected are now in your hands.   The validation for East Power should be very easy because we collected broker quotes almost every day and marked curves nearly every day.   If there are gaps, please let me know.
 
With respect to vol curves, I am having Wang and Stalford go back and validate.




Thanks for your help with this.  We are validating everything from December 3 until the present.

I agree with the delegation except for Chris Dorland.   Tim Belden needs to determine who validates the West Power curves.   With respect to vol curves, Steve Wang and Rob Stalford need to validate.
 
What time period are we validating?

FYI - I spoke with Kevin today and he volunteered the following individuals to help you curve validation. 
Chris Dorland - West 
Doug Gilbert-Smith - ERCOT 
Dana Davis - NE 
Fletch Sturm - MW/SE
