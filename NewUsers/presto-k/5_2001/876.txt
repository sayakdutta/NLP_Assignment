Thanks. 

  

Kevin, 

This is for the full requirements uncertainty associated with green mountain and includes a reserve against teh liabilitiy exposure for the QSE agreements.

Please let me know if you have any other questions,

Did you get this reserve cleared through Lavorato?  If you have not, can you do so immediately. 

Thanks, 
Stacey
