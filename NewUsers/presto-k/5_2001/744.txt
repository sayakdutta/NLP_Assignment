Background on Meeting:

Enron's Environmental Strategies group will convene an "Emissions Strategy Meeting" on Friday May 18.  
Based on very positive responses, we expect participation from a number of commercial groups from within Enron -- including Enron Europe, EES, ENA, ETS, EGM and others.

The meeting will be held from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. (including lunch) in room 8C1, 8th floor of the Enron Building.  (Representatives of Enron Europe will participate in the morning session by video conference, and others from various locations will participate by telephone.)

The objectives of the session are to:

1) provide Enron commercial and support groups with the latest information on emissions regulation, markets, and Enron's advocacy efforts worldwide, and

2) receive feedback on commercial interests and input on policy options so that we may develop the best business and policy strategies for Enron in both the short and long term.
