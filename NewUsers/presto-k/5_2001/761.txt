Chuck -

could you please put a spreadsheet  together (like BECO) that summarizes all of the active curves we are using to price this deal.

Thanks,
RH


Rogers,

I understand that I need to brief you on the NYU Medical deal regarding the structure etc..  We are expecting to close this on Friday, the 11th, for which we will be getting executable pricing tomorrow.

The term of the deal is : 6/01 through 12/02,
Fixed generation only price: $99.78/mwh (including ICAP, and ancillary services)
Total no. of accounts: 28, all behind ConEd Zone J, and we will be signing 5 separate contracts with the 5 different legal entities.

Please let me know if you need me to provide any additional information.

Thanks,
Bani
