Dear Ms. Fraser:

Downes Associates, Inc. is working with several wholesale and retail
electric customers in Pennsylvania and Maryland. We are developing contact
lists to use for RFP distribution in the near future.  We also have a need
to create a similar list for natural gas suppliers.

Please provide the following information via return e-mail or forward this
e-mail to the most appropriate representative in the Enron organization.

1. Contact information for your representative who should receive an RFP for
wholesale electric power supply in the Pennsylvania/Maryland area.

2. Contact information for your representative who should receive an RFP for
aggregated retail electric power supply in the Pennsylvania/Maryland area.

3. Contact information for your representative who should receive an RFP for
aggregated retail gas supply in the Pennsylvania/Maryland area.

Information should include:

Name
Title
Company/Division
Mailing Address
Phone
Fax
E-mail

Also, please answer the following question.

4. Do you use any electronic platform to receive load data for pricing and
bid such as the UniGrid for electricity or Aquila/RFP:YourEnergySource for
gas?  If so, please specify which platform you use.

Thank you for your consideration in this matter.
