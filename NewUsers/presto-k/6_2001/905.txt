Good to hear from you and thanks again for the baby gift - much appreciated.  The family is great - Caitlin just turned 3 and Dane is now 4 months old.

I hope Fran and the kids are doing great - how's your new addition?   We will be going to Miami Sept 13-16 (Miami revenge on Washington) and hopefully we can hook up for a beer.

As far as the guy from Citizens - we really don't know that much about him.   Where is Tony Altman - under a bus somewhere?

 

Kevin:

I got your voice mail this morning.  I've heard of snail-mail, but that
kind of delay really is impressive!  I thought maybe the package got lost,
or more likely, pilfered by one of your unscrupulous co-workers (just
kidding).

In any case, now you have my e-mail address.

Also, we have a new president of the unregulated trading shop (if you can
call what we do "trading") - Mark Maisto from Citizens.  Seems like a sharp
guy.  Do you know anything about him?

How's Evelyn, Katlin Page and the new one doing (I forgot his name - Kevin
Jr.?).
