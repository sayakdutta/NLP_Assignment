Not sure if you have seen this yet.  But NESCAUM has compiled a list of power plants they could find that have committed to install SCRs, sample SCR experiences (and the timing of outages to install SCRs), and an aggregated look at the states' NOx allowance budgets vs. SCR commitments. (paints a good picture of who has yet to pay the piper.)  It might be a good way to double check & update some of the research efforts you were undertaking last winter.

Let me know if you have questions or need additional information.
