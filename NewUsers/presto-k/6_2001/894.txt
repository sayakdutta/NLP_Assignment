The highlights I would focus on are:

1) East Power has traded over 600 million MWh's YTD 2001 (compared to 450 million MWh's for all of 2000)
2) Averaging 350 trades per day on EOL for 2001 YTD (compared to 100 in 2000).   In the last two weeks, EOL daily transactions have averaged nearly 500.
3) Significant improvement in liquidity in all markets - EPMI now trades actively through 2005 in nearly every eastern market.
4) Positive P&L in every Eastern region
5) Outstanding return on VAR.

 


Kevin,

Could you please get Jeff Skilling the information he is requesting....please let me know if you need anything from me.

Thanks Tjae
 

Hi Tjae-

Jeff Skilling has requested some bullet points about Power Trading before the Floor Meeting. He likes to tailor his discussion to the groups and needs some highlights about your activities. If you or Kevin could send me bullets about the last few weeks or one month's worth of information, that should be enough.

Please call me if you have any questions.

Tjae-
Here is the invitation to be distributed via email to your Power Trading Houston employees.  Please send it on or before 
June 4.  Generally, they like to have feedback from everyone who is present for Jeff's meetings!  Please distribute via email before the presentation, if possible.  Most groups use it as a reminder memo the day before or the morning of the meeting. It is entirely up to you. 
    
Let me know if you have any questions.
