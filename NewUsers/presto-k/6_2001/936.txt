Could you take a crack at a draft for the Skilling/Lay presentation.   The presentation should focus on supply/demand (97-02), RTO progess in each region, and the progression of heat rate curves (expanded last year and compressing this year), pricing history, volatility graphs, etc.

Thanks.

 


Can you guys start putting a high level presentation together for your region for a presentation to Lay and Skilling.  I'll try to set up the date or dates but can you guys send me something tentative by next Wednesday.  Touching on the past and how its changed vs current and forward would be a good way of looking at it.

Liz can you try to set up a date 2 weeks from now with Skilling and Lay.  Tim were you going to be in Houston this month.  If so it might be easier to do it then.

Per our conversation on yesterday..... Greg wants your guys (their show - give them the face time) to prepare a presentation on Natural Gas & Power Fundamentals. Can we pull this together in the next couple of weeks?

Many Thanks,
