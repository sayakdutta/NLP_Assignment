I think you forgot the cash postion.  I would rather have on-line valuation, even if the $'s aren't perfect.   I like to look at my personal equity portfolio (includes Enron hedging) separate from Enron granted stock and option value.   

One portfolio is liquid and the other is not and I monitor differently.

 

Mr. Presto,
Why don't I just do this for you on a monthly basis? Please see attached PDF
Acrobat file. Please elt me know if you have trouble opening it.

Thanks,
Hank Emery







Thanks.

   Mr. Presto,
   I'll work on some things. let me play with it for awhile and I'll see
   what
   we can figure out.

   Thanks,

   Except it can't be negative because they were grants at no cost to me.
   The problem is the combination of restricted stock which is total market
   value and options which is gain/loss need to be added together to get
   total
   portfolio value.

   I was hoping you could trick the system so portfolio value was accurate.

      Mr. Presto,
      That is true, I was wondering if we shouldn't just figure that the
      Gain/Loss(Difference between the current market value and the cost
      basis)
      represents the actual value of the stock option portfolio. Does that
      make
      sense?

      Thanks,
      Hank Emery

      
                        

      The options are not valued properly.   The market value is calculated
      based upon the value of the underlying, which grossly overstates the
      market value of the portfolio.  The restricted stock (basis of $0) is
      valued OK, but the options are not.

      In addition, the year restricted stock and option grant is not yet in
      the portfolio.
