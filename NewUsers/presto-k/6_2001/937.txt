I agree.   We don't know the base value of the current deal, so how can we make an incremental value decision on a restructuring.   

 


Kevin -

I do not think we should restructure until we have completed ausit and re-booking.  I have expressed this and we have made all efforts to prioritize and work with the deal teams.  This will continue to be my message unless you feel otherwise.

	We currently have several deals that are in the process of being restructured and/or unwound.  The same issue that came up with Quebecor has surfaced on these deals as well; are we giving away value by not having them booked correctly?  All the transactions that Casey and myself are working on consist of these types of deals.  We need to tell origination when they can expect to close these deals.  This will of course depend on how much remodelling needs to be done.  Can everyone meet at 4:00 today to discuss this?  The meeting shouldn't take to long.  Thanks for your time.
