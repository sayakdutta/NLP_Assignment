I will have TJ set up and Lloyd attend.

thanks.

 


Kevin,  Can I schedule a one-hour meeting with you sometime early next week?  If OK, I'll get TJ to find an afternoon slot on your calendar.  I would like to provide you with an East Desk IT state-of-the-union and make sure we are on the same page.

Thanks,  Steve
