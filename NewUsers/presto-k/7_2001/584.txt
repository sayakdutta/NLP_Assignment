The curve sheet is fine, but I totally diagree with the morning report and demand forecast.   I would not give these to the risk group.

 


Kevin I have asked Rika to provide these reports to the risk group.

This was identified in a Arthur Anderson audit that was recently done.  

This process closes the risk reporting loop between fundies, risk and trading.
