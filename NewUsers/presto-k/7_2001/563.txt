We should value the project.   A combined cycle in Eastern NY may make sense.





Any interest in pursuing this?  Project located in the Albany NY area.  Not sure how far along this is, but i think the developer behind this is not well-funded and is somewhat unsophisticated.  Please let me know if there's any interest

Please respond to Dan, 


We would like to speak to someone about the sale/purchace of the Glenville 
Project, a 520 MW gas-fired, combined cycle project located in the Capital 
District of NY. Who would we contact? 

The project has continued to be funded by GE Power Systems and is at a point 
where, according to their plan, permanent equity would enter into the 
project. The project is filing its Article 10 application after having 
invested substantial money and resources. The permit issuance looks good, 
energy pricing has held up well, and this project will be part of the first 
group to be licenced.
