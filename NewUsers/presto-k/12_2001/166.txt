I cancelled this over 4 months ago.   Someone might have assumed by terminal.

 

Kevin,
We are in the process of cancelling a majority of the Bloombergs at Enron.  Our records show that you have a system that has not
been logged into since November 7.  Could you please let me know if it is okay to cancel this?

Thanks!

Julie
