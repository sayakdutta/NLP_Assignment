Kevin & John -

We will likely experience significant exposure as a result of force majeure related to the recent WTC events.  A preliminary assessment is as follows:

Total exposure $7MM - $10MM.  This assumes we lose the entire contractual commitment.

Largest Exposure:  American Express - approximately $5.5 - $6.0 MM
Mass Market Customers: - approximately $1.5 MM

I am also anticipating additional credit related exposure.

We are assessing this exposure and will be determining how best to mitigate.
