I say we don't make any changes until we get in the new building and we will have a better feel for the vendors.

 

Zydeco is Cajun...do you have any other suggestions?

 

What is Zydeco?   No to Chinese.

 

Kevin,

Are yall ready for a change?  I have had a few people come over and leave suggestions for lunch...Zydeco, Chinease,  different type of Italian.  Please let me know what your thoughts are.

Thanks
