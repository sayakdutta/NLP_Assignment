Carson is done and I just talked with Suarez.   I told John he needs to make his decision based on the economics in his package.   150/150 is a great package for Suarez.   I would be uncomfortable increasing based on other areas where we may be short.    Good news on Craw.

Kevin,
 
Put Russell down as 100%.  He's in San Antonio this weekend with his visiting brothers and unfortunately, his contract is here in Houston.  I talked to him last night and he had Jeannie Sloan fax his doc to the hotel and he assured me he'd review it then or first thing this a.m.  I'm sure he'll find the language acceptable since it's merely a 30-day evergreen.  As for additional $'s, I personally guaranteed him $10k and gave him 50-50 odds on the 1-year contract we talked about yesterday.  He's in either way.
 
 I also called Suarez yesterday and left a message, but haven't heard back yet.  I'll lob another call in this morning around 10am.
 
Did you receive a faxed signature copy from Carson yesterday/this a.m.?
