All,
FYI, thought you might find this interesting.  This is the research report, by Ray Niles at Salomon, referenced in today's MW Daily.  A lot of it is pretty basic, but there were some interesting things--note thoughts on transaction hierarchy, comparison between energy marketers and financial institutions, thoughts on VAR and accounting standards.
