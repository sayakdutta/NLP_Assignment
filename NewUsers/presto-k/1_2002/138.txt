All East Traders will have East only trading rights except for me.    With respect to regions, assume the same organization as we ended with in early November.   The one change is Rogers in the SE along with Suarez, and Carson.

MW - Fletch, Russell, and Jason
SE - Rogers, Suarez, Carson
ERCOT - Doug, King, Schiavone, Saibi
NE - Dana, Benson, Gupta, Broderick, Thomas (off-peak), Misra, Rogers, Makkai, Step, Schneider
Options - Arora, Stalford, Wang, Gualy
Real-Time - Forney (ERCOT), Baughman (MW/SE), Miguel (MW/SE)

Remember, all of the desk heads will have gas trading authority as well.   None of the prompt month cash traders will be trading gas.

 

Kevin,

In an attempt to begin the setup of trading books and desks for Netco, we will need a list of desk assignments (i.e. which trader will be trading which region) and the regional organization (i.e. Northeast, Midwest, etc.) of such desks.  Also, will East traders be trading only east delivery points?

Thanks!
Casey
