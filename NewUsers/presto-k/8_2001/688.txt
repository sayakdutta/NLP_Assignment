Look forward to hearing from you.

Thanks.

 

Hi Kevin.  I just got your email and tomorrow I will be at Enron Field for  
the Astros game.  I try to be as flexible as possible for meetings and  
usually try to schedule them in the evenings or on weekends; whatever is most  
convenient for you. 
I anticipate getting home late tomorrow nite and will call you Wednesday  
evening if that is alright.   
I look forward to meeting with you and working with you on your new home. 
Thank you for your consideration.
