Rogers is meeting with Janet to sell this concept.   If necessary, I will follow-up.

 

Just to prove that I don't play golf everyday.

My good friend Ozzie and I met about site profile.  He agrees that it should be with Demand Side Management.  He also agrees that Jay should do it with him.  If it happens I will meet with them every 2 weeks to keep them on track.  

Now the problem.

Jay needs to agree not to be an originator.  Dave needs to agree with the whole concept.

Working You.
