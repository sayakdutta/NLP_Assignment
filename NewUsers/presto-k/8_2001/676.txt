Good info.   Consistent with reports from McGowan.   I am now short 02 at $39/ton and long 03-04 at $32.50/ton.   Love the spread given my view of natty.

Since the report is almost identical to info I have received from McGowan, I don't see any pressing need to call Alan.   You are certainly free to call him if you want.



 


Kevin -

I just received this.  You may want to read it and we can give Alan a call if you like.

your comment. I would be interested in your views of our views.
