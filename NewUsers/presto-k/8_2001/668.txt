Tobey -

I would classify URM as :

Trading 
Power

I'm working with the ISC on categorizing profit center numbers and setting up the EWS SAP hierarchy.

Please categorize URM as one of the following Business Activities:

Origination
Merchant Investments
Asset Operations


and one of the following product groups:

Gas
Power
Equity
Debt

Thanks!
