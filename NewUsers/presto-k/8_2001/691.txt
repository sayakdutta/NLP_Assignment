We would like you both to attend our 4 o'clock Thursday meeting next week (9/4) to give us some project updates and discuss the goals and timelines of your groups.  Feel free to bring anyone/thing necessary to help you convey the message.  If you have any specific questions as to the meeting objectives, call Rogers, Jeff or myself anytime.  Thanks
