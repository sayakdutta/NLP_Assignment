BEER! 
 
Would it focus if the lense cap were on? When i was focusing they looked like they should have turned out nice. Weird. I quess thats why we need to take pics with two cameras.



Well sure Joe?all the pictures before AND after your efforts were just perfect?.still trying to figure it out. Hand over the lens is the only thing I could come up with, because the settings never change (being that it is an auto focus unit) unless you force them. Weird?
 

 
does your camera work?

RRRIIIIIGGGGGHHHHHTTTTT
 

 
ok, whose the worst photograper you know

Actually Joe?the last 2 pictures that you took (incidentally, the only 2 pictures you took) were BLANK!!! Don't ask me why, but they were not exposed at all!!! So, I took one of Erik's shots, scanned it and blocked it. Worked out pretty well, I think. 
 

 
whose the best photographer

I finally found the damn trigger?or at least figured out what it was for!!!
 

 
Yeah, but who shot it?  Surely it wasn't BRIAN!
