HOW TO GROW MOLLYPOPS.
 FENNER HOUSEHOLD DOES A SWAP WITH MOLLYPOPS, AN LLC FOR FORWARD PRODUCTS,.  OF COURSE RECONIZE IT AS INCOME TO MOLLYPOPS, AND THAN THE FENNERS GET A SMALL BUSINESS LOAN TO PAY FOR THE SWAP, USE YOUR HOUSE AS COLATERAL. OF COURSE YOU WILL HAVE TO MEET THE 3% NON CONSOLIDATION RULE TO KEEP YOUR PERSONNEL AND BUSINEES AFFAIRS SEPERATE. YOU COULD GET e TO PUT UP 1000, AND ASSIGN HIM MAJORITY OF THE PARTNERSHIP. AND TO MAKE HIM FEEL BETTER, YOU COULD SET UP A RESEVRE ACCOUNT TO PROTECT HIS INVESTMENT. OH YOU MIGHT HAVE TO GARUNANTEE HIM A 15% RETURN.




Actually, he's from Enron (thus the question).  I saw some of that in the
paper.  Unbelievable (agreed).




ISNT ANDERSON YOUR AUDITOR? IS THAT A CONFLICT?

YOU SHOULD READ SOME OF THE POWERS REPORT. UNBELIEVEABLE!




My buddy up here knew a guy he had listed as a reference from Andersen, so
we got the inside scoop.

Any prospects out there?




dont know who that is. i can find out if you want me too. I know a few
people in RAC. things arround here still suck. i am doing a little stock
trading and trying to find a job. basically doing the bare minimum to keep
the paycheck




Do you know of a Chris Gray?  Probably a long-shot, but he worked at Enron
in the Risk Assessment and Control group.

What's up w/ you?  What's the latest?
