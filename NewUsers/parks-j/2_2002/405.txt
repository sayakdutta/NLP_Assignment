LOWER, however it doesnt break soon. it will consolidate. dont see any big rallies or major pull backs




What's it trying to do here?  I feel like we may trade up a little as people
start to grow "bored" w/ the acct'g issues, then will resume the downtrend
as people see bad news in the economy.  What do you think over the next week
or two?
