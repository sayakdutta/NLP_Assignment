you let me have access to girl man Myers?

 

Joe, 

I promised Chip something in writing by lunchtime tomorrow.  Please let me know if you can't be done by then.  If memory serves me there wasn't much more that needed to be done.

Talked to Chip.  We do need Cash Committe approval given the netting feature of your deal, which means Batch Funding Request.  Please update per my previous e-mail and forward.

Thanks
