ISNT ANDERSON YOUR AUDITOR? IS THAT A CONFLICT?

YOU SHOULD READ SOME OF THE POWERS REPORT. UNBELIEVEABLE!




My buddy up here knew a guy he had listed as a reference from Andersen, so
we got the inside scoop.

Any prospects out there?




dont know who that is. i can find out if you want me too. I know a few
people in RAC. things arround here still suck. i am doing a little stock
trading and trying to find a job. basically doing the bare minimum to keep
the paycheck




Do you know of a Chris Gray?  Probably a long-shot, but he worked at Enron
in the Risk Assessment and Control group.

What's up w/ you?  What's the latest?
