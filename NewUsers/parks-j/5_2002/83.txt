Ok with Freds. and Playa. Dont know anything about Galveston, need more info( days?).




We need to decide about the Playa del carmen trip.  THe cheapest airfare we
have found is $426.  THe trip would probably end up costing us a little over
$1000 (per couple) not including food.  Our thought are to leave on June 13
and return on June 16 so we would be there over our anniversary.  I am
thinking of taking that whole week off if we decide to go to Fredericksburg
and then Galveston (Gene's got that hotel room at Moody Gardens) the early
part of the week.  WHat are you thoughts?
