Ms. Fraser:  I've attached two versions (your choice) of the NatGas
presentation.  They will need an overhead projector and an easel/flipchart
for their presentation.  They will also meet you Sunday at 7:45 at the St.
Regis Hotel for dinner.  Have a nice weekend.  Any questions please feel
free to contact me.
