Si, la cabana es me casa. Habla con ti, esta sabado

 

yes-I am coming or all of us are coming for at least part of the party.  My
nephew/godson #2 birthday is the same day.  So I will be by for a bit.
I will see you then.

By the way, I am assuming that the "cabana" is at your house.  Is this
correct?
