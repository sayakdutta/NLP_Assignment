IN? WHEN?





I am IN!!! Would like to be there by 6:30 or so...maybe later. Zander is "out"...unless he brings Jake. Someone forward to Chambers...you know he's in.

								BC




Zero response from my last effort on this matter. Are your emails working 
men?

Zander called and suggested we attend the CCA crawfish boil function to be 
held Thurday May 2, 2002. Reasonably priced event, beer, mud bugs and we can 
sit back and watch pig win raffle prizes.

I'm in
