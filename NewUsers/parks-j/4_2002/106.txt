things are well, slowly ramping it up and gegtting back into it

 

For VAR 95 using a Delta gamma approach
1.645 * position * price * daily vol = VAR 

Remember daily vol is implied vol divided by sqrt of time or 16 in this case.

How do you like your new digs?

 

hey, how are you? can you send me an example of how you callculate var on contracts.

for example: price is 3.10, 100 contracts, vol. 60%
