The latest imbalance report from TXU reflects an imbalance of 228,852 on k 1671 as of 12/01 production.  TXU is sending a new report as of 1/01 production.  I will forward that imbalance value when I receive the fax.

 



 

i was looking at march - but i guess january would be the lastest we have.  so yes;

 

as of what time period - Jan. 2002?

 

can you check out what our imbalance is on TXU gas distribution is on K#1671?  unify is only showing a beginning balance of
72134 mmbtu's, but the trader (joe parks) thinks we have around 500000.
