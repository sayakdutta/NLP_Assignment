HEy, i will talk to Kim about saturday. Saturday it should be clear out there. the question will be friday. the long QQQ  is a short term couple of bucks type trade. think its got 35-36




Technology is not quite where it needs to be yet. I s/b able to simply think
about moving $$ and making an investment, as I don't seem to have time these
days to get online and do it!  I just watch the virtual gains slip away...

By the way, I'm still looking to get out to KC this weekend, but I can't
seem to figure out what the weather is going to do.  The San Antonio
forecast looks different than KC's, so I can't tell what the chances of rain
are on Friday and Saturday.  Want to make sure it's worth while.  What do
the "models" say?

Of course, if you don't go, I'll probably blow it off anyway (no pressure).




Yes, i can make a little money on the long side of a market
