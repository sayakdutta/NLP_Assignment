We still have not received the May LILCO invoice, nor the July Swing Rate.
Please advise when we will receive this information.

Thank you!






cc:






Demand charge for July:  .60

The swing rate will be on the July invoice which is scheduled to go out,
along
with June, in about 2 weeks.
May's invoice should go out next week.
