During the routine weekly sampling of the PG&E system, it was discovered that 
approx. 3 oz of liquid had collected in the new filter separator in the PG&E 
C/S yard.  A request was made to analyze the liquid for not only PCB's but 
also pH to determine if the liquids resulted from the caustic and water 
cleaning of the upstream portion of the pipe leading into the PG&E C/S .  
This is the first occurance of liquids at this location since this new filter 
separator was installed and put inot service.
