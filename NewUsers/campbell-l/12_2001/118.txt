 Adel, please send this blank matrix to the project manager and have them complete the title information amd items A through E in the upper box on the first page, then send it to me. This will greatly  assist me in determining what permits, plans and other regulatory documents will be requried.

thanks

Good Morning - 

Attached are two PAF for a retire and install a by pass valve on Unit #9 at Spraberry.

 << File: PAF Plug valve.xls >>  << File: PAF Plug valve ret.xls >> 

These projects are completed.  Do you mind filling out an environmental matrix for this project.  We need to send the matrix in with the completion package. We are ready to send the package to Houston.

Thanks for your help

Adel
