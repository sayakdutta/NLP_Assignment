There was once a man who didn't believe in God, and he =20
didn't hesitate to let others know how he felt about religion and =20
religious holidays, like Christmas. His wife, however, did=20
believe, and she raised their children to also  have faith in=20
God and Jesus, despite  his disparaging comments.  =20
=20
One snowy Christmas Eve, his wife was taking  their children=20
to a Christmas Eve service in the farm  community in which they=20
lived.  She  asked him to come, but he refused. =20
=20
"That story is nonsense!" he said. "Why would  God lower=20
Himself to come to Earth as a man?  That's ridiculous!" So=20
she and the children left,  and he stayed home.  =20
=20
A while later, the winds grew stronger and the  snow turned=20
into a blizzard.  As the man  looked out the window, all he=20
saw was a blinding snowstorm.   He sat down to relax before =20
the fire for the evening. Then he heard  a loud thump.  =20
Something had hit the window. Then another  thump. He  =20
looked out, but couldn't see  more than a few feet. When the=20
snow let up a little, he ventured  outside to see what could=20
have been beating on  his window.  In the field near his=20
house he saw a flock of wild geese. Apparently  they had been=20
flying south for the winter when they got  caught in the snowstorm =20
and couldn't go on. They were lost and  stranded on his farm, with no=20
food or shelter. They just flapped  their wings and flew around the field=
=20
in low circles, blindly and  aimlessly. A couple of them had flown into=20
his window, it  seemed.=20
=20
The man felt sorry for the geese and wanted to  help them. The barn=20
would  be a great place for them to stay,  he thought. It's warm and safe;=
=20
surely they could spend the night  and wait out the storm. So he walked ove=
r to=20
the barn and  opened the doors wide, then watched and waited, hoping they =
=20
would notice the open barn and go inside. But the geese just  fluttered aro=
und=20
aimlessly and didn't seem to notice the barn or  realize what it could mean=
=20
for them.  The man tried to get  their attention, but that just seemed to s=
care=20
them and they  moved further away. He went into the house and came with  so=
me=20
bread, broke it up, and made a breadcrumbs trail leading to  the barn.  The=
y=20
still didn't catch on.=20
=20
Now he was getting frustrated. He got behind  them and tried to shoo them=
=20
toward the barn, but they only got more scared  and scattered in every=20
direction except toward the barn. Nothing he  did could get them to go into=
=20
the barn where they would be warm  and safe. "Why don't they follow me?!" =
=20
he exclaimed.  "Can't they see this is the only place where they  can survi=
ve=20
the storm?" He thought for a moment and realized  that they just wouldn't f=
ollow=20
a human. "If only I were a  goose, then I could save them," he said out lou=
d. =20

Then  he had an idea. He went into barn, got one of his own geese, and carr=
ied it  in his  arms as he circled around behind the flock of  wild   geese=
.  He then released it. His goose flew through the flock and  straight into=
 the barn--and one by one the other geese followed it to  safety.  =20

He stood silently for a moment as the words he  had spoken a few minutes ea=
rlier replayed in his mind: "If only I were  a goose, then I  could save th=
em!" Then he thought about what he  had said to his wife earlier. =20
=20
"Why would God want to be like us? That's  ridiculous!"  =20
=20
Suddenly it all made sense. That is what God  had done. We were like the=20
geese--blind, lost, perishing. God had His Son  become like us so He could=
=20
show us the way and save us. That was  the meaning of Christmas, he realize=
d. =20


As the winds and blinding snow died down, his soul became quiet =20
and pondered this wonderful thought. Suddenly he understood what  Christmas=
 was=20
all about, why Christ had come.    Years  of doubt and disbelief=20
vanished like the passing storm. He fell to his knees in the snow, and  pra=
yed his first  prayer: "Thank You, God, for coming in human form to  get me=
 out of the storm!"
