Ray, Kay had mentioned that your team was having an OCD inpsection this week (Wednesday?).  Ive tried to contact you a couple of times to see if you might need some help, but was unsuccessful.  Is there something wrong with your phone?  Give me a call if you feel uncomfortable about any issue prior to their visit. I will be in the office on wednesday but gone from 11:30 am-1:45 pm.  Let me know how the  inspection went.......
