Steve, you have been given all the written permit history and portable 
analyzer correspondance from myself to and from the State of New  Mexico.  
All of my air permit files were copied and sent to you previously.  If there 
is confusion, I apologize but everything that has been agreed to by the State 
of New Mexico has been made available for review and use.

If I need to sit down with you and or others to go over this, let me know.

    This will work just fine, just after the call is made to me concerning a 
NM Audit, please send me a lotus note concerning this request.  
Their have been to misunderstandings and confusion concerning portable 
testing in New Mexico and I need this for my protection.

Again if their are any questions or concerns pertaining to this request, I 
encourage anyone to call.

Steve due to New Mexico's new focus on conducting surprise inspections, there 
may not  be the opportunity of advanced notice.  In  the effort to keep 
everyone in the loop,  notification will be made to those individuals when I 
receive a call from the state.

         In the future if their is a request for portable testing in State of 
New Mexico, or if the AQB is performing an audit at any facility, I will 
support and go where ever necessary day or night.  

       I would only ask that after the call that this is put in Lotus notes 
for my personal records.

I'm sure you can understand.

If anyone has any questions or concerns please feel free to call.
