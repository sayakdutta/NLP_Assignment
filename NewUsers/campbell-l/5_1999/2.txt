Just a short message to apprise everyone of the cleaning results performed on 
the filter separator from the Transwestern M/S.  Wipe tests taken of the 
interrior portions of the separator prior to cleaning revealed PCB results 
of: 360, 500 and 520 microgram.   This was not a standard wipe taken of a 
specific area.  These wipes were taken over large areas to determine 
presence/absence of PCB's within the separator.  After the cleaning operation 
was completed, three wipe samples were taken of the interrior portions of the 
separator.  All results showed non detect at less than 1.0 microgram.  I feel 
we can be fairly certain that the separator is free of residual PCBs.  

Jeff, would you pass this information on to your counterpart for PG&E?
