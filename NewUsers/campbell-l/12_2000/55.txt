Markets Committee Members:  A meeting of the Working Group of the Markets
Committee has been scheduled for Wednesday, December 13, 2000 from 9:00 a.m.
to 3:00 p.m. at the Holiday Inn in Holyoke, MA.  The meeting's agenda
consists of two items, both of which involve MR 17: (1) Transmission
Congestion Compensation and (2) Structural Screen for OP-4 (bid cap) type of
conditions.

Attached is a file containing two exhibits that provide congestion
information that, hopefully, will aid in the group's discussion on the first
item.  With respect to the second item, we will forward to you any materials
we receive.  If you can not make the meeting in person we have arranged for
a conference call.  The dial-in number is as follows:

Telephone Number:  (212) 293-3100
Passcode:  7837367

Thank you.

Don.

Also, attached is the directions to the ISO which show where the Holyoke
Holiday Inn is located.  As you get off 91 North you will see it on your
left just past the gas station at the corner of Whiting Farms Road and Lower
Holyoke Road.  To your right is Holyoke Mall.  If you should have any
questions, please give Susan Dumond a call at (413) 535-4097.
