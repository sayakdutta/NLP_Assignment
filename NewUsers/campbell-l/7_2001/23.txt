I'm Chi's cousin.  We grew up in Palacios together.  I used one of her email
list to send this out because I recognized most of them. I apologize if I
caused any problems.




     who r u? r u a friend of Chi's?

    









   
   Just in case you are having some downtime.  This game will test how well
   you
   know yourself and your fellow Asians.  I hope that it doesn't offend
   anyone
   - no, it's not lewd, it's kinda funny. Enjoy!
