NON-BROOKLYNESE DICTIONARY
* Staten Island is  where all of NY dumps it's garbage. The garbage now looks like a small Mountain  Range with seagulls always in attendance.
** BQU = Brooklyn/Queens Expressway  - The place where you take your life into your hands by entering from the "on  ramp". You have to reach the speed of 60 mph to have any hopes of entering and  you have to have breaks that can stop on "a dime" when your hopes of entering  are dashed by a 18 wheeler barreling down on your position.
