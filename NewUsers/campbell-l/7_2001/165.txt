George, Dave Cobrain of the NMED has verbally approved of the soil 
characterization work plan which you submitted to him for review and has said 
that we can begin work as soon as the plan is approved by the OCD.  I have 
not heard from Bill Olson of the OCD yet.  Dave was going to inform the OCD 
that their office has given approval of the plan and that this might expidite 
Bill's review process.  Ill let you know when I hear from the OCD.
