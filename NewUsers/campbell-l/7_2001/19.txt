	i agree.


 

Hey Larry,

I made some changes to 7-19...

695979.1 & 695995.1 - had extra hour (HE 23) - I zeroed this hour out (NYISO 5081505)
694766.1 - missing HE 11&12 per PJM & NYISO - I added these two hours in

Please check these changes and let me know if you do not agree with them.

Thanks,
Michael
