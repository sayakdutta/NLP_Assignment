I spoke with Ken Jacobs, with the Forest Service in Flagstaff, concerning his 
agencies approval for the turbine construction at Station 2.  As a condition 
of the approval from his agency, he has requested that all the ponderosa pine 
trees to be removed for the turbine construction activities be flagged for 
identification.  After the trees have been marked, we are to then contact him 
so that he can visit the site and make an evaluation as to whether the Forest 
Service will charge us for the tree removal or whether no additional charges 
will be incurred as a result of the construction activity.  The charges will 
depend upon the calculation of how many board feet of lumber there are in the 
trees which are flagged.

As this activity is included in the time line for completion of all permits 
and approvals, please contact me when the trees have been tagged and flagged 
and I will contact Ken Jacobs so that he can make a site visit.
