On behalf of EOTT, an environmental records review was completed for a block 
of Koch crude oil pipeline assets located in south Texas.  There were no 
issues or environmental deficiencies identified during the review.  A due 
diligence was recommended to verify confirmation of the housekeeping  
activities presented in the records review.

The air permit modification for the La Plata C/S was received from the state 
of Colorado.  This modification allows for additional emissions and fuel use 
as a result of  a change in gas quality supplies in the San Juan basin.
