Under the regulations of the state of Arizona, facilities which have a 
pollution prevention plan (sta.1, sta. 2 and Needles) are required to have an 
annual training to evaluate pollution prevention activiies.  I have scheduled 
with the above three facilities to have pollution training on the following 
dates:

  Kingman team June 21

  Flagstaff team June 22

This training is to be completed by July 1 of every year.  This training will 
last for approximately 2-3 hours.  Employees that works at any of the three 
facilities are required to be present for the training.  Your participation 
in this will be greatly appreciated.
