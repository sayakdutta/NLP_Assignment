Lorraine, Ill give you a call this afternoon.  By the way, did they test the 
liquids for PCBs?  I havent heard from the Gallup team on whether they have 
gone and checked for collected liquids at their I/C's.  Rick, can youcheck on 
this for me?




Larry - Today I met with representatives from PNM and we discussed the 
information set forth below.  PNM recently tested for liquids at Rio Puerco 
and found liquids, specifically C5+ and think this is coming from TW.  Please 
call me to discuss.  Thanks.

We went out to our Rio Puerco interconnect and tried collecting a liquid 
sample for PCB sampling, but
had no liquid to collect.  So, Larry if you can let Lorraine know that we 
were unsuccessful in collecting this sample
I'd highly appreciate it. Thank you !
