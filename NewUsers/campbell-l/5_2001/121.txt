Arnold, I  have attached a spreadsheet showing what information I need to 
complete the air permit applications.  I have set the Flagstaff site as the 
model, due to its elevation and temperature which is the worst case site.  
Let me know if there are any problems with the attached data request.

Arnold, I assume that when you say you are at the factory, you mean Italy.  
If so, is it possible for you to get a fax?  If so, I could fax over to you a 
template of what information I need.  If not, Ill give you a list of the 
engine parameters.  Let me know...







Larry,

could you draft a template for NP the way you want them to give the
emissions warrenty to support your filing.


we are at the factory and could care of this now.

Arnold
