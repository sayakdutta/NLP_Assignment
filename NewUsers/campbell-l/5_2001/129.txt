Bill you may want to sit in on this if you have time.  It seems we have items 
of concern that were identified during the consolidated audit at Bakersfield 
which were tied into  a previous agreement with Koch for which the action 
team did not know when the action items were prepared.  The action dates are 
approaching and   Scott and I are having a hard time getting clearification 
on how to initiate getting the the action items started due to the 
responsibility of Koch for some of the items.  Ed, the attorney for EOTT,  
will be requested by Lou, to notify Koch concerning their responsiblity.  If 
this sounds convoluted, then you know as much as I.....
