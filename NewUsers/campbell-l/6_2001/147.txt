I dont know if you guys are doing this, but a requirement to your air permit 
states that the facility is to report the number of hours of operation each 
year to the Air Quality Bureau for the Catepillar generator.  The report is 
to be submitted by January 31st of each year.  If we need to discuss this, 
give me a call.
