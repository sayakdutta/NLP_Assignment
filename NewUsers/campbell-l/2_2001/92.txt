Thanx, George.  Please let us know what their initial reaction and evaluation 
is of the conditions at Sta. 6.  Im interested in what their thoughts are 
with respect to the remediation of  the sandstone fractures and movement of 
condensate with PCB's..

Larry,
I contacted Norm Moreno at the POEP this afternoon. He said that he would 
contact Ed Steadman, Associate Director at the EERC, and pass along my name 
and number so that Ed could contact me. Norm said that he would prefer to do 
it this way rather than to have us initiate the first contact. The other day 
I found the web site for the research center (www.eerc.und.nodak.edu).
