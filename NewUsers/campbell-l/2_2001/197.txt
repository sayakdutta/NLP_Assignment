  Public Statement by the Rev. Jesse Jackson

  Due to the great consternation caused by the
  revelation of my act of procreation, I accept my
  obligation to give an explanation to the
  population for my act of copulation.

  I gave in to temptation, for the anticipation of
  sexual gratification, that I could not obtain through
  masturbation, resulted in my fornication.
   I accepted her invitation, and provided her with
  excitation, stimulation, penetration, replication, and
  liberation.

  She provided lubrication (to avoid inflammation) and I
  wore condoms to avoid contamination. She cried  for
  duplication but I insisted upon
  termination, in spite of her fascination with
  variation.

  This has caused me great aggravation, and the
  agitation and provocation of the media has resulted in
  my humiliation, denigration, and
  degradation. My wife is considering castration, which
  would require my hospitalization.

  Pray that this matter will find culmination in my
  sanctification and rehabilitation so that my plans for
  nomination to my ultimate vocation will not result in
  revocation and termination.I hope this proclamation
  has provided illumination and verification and will
  prohibit further provocation (or investigation).

  Sincerely,
  The Rev. Jesse Jackson
