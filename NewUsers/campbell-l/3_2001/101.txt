Byron as per the Red Rock expansion conference call today presented below are 
the emissions estimates for the auxillary engines at sta. 1-4.  Understand 
these are not actual emissions, but are emissions based upon potential to 
emit.  When these units were permitted actual testing data was not required, 
so each unit was permitted based upon an accpeted emissions limit from an EPA 
approved document.  This has worked out in our favor as the emisisons numbers 
presented in the EPA document were high, therefore, this will allow us to net 
more emissions, if needed.  Emissions are presented for a single engine only 
in tons per year, even though there are two auxillary units at each facility 
except Sta. 1 where they only have one auxillary unit.
