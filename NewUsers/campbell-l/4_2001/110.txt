Guys, look at the attached draft of a letter I plan on sending to the Laguna 
pueblo regarding Transwestern efforts to date of finding new technologies to 
address and remove PCB contamination from the groundwater at the facility.

You may remember, we had a meeting in January to hear the Laguna's concerns 
that Transwestern was not moving fast enough to clean up the site.  This 
letter addresses our attempts to find a solution to the PCB problem, and that 
remediation technologies are not presently available to operate effectively 
at the site given the sites unique characterisstics.  Id like to send this 
out on Friday or Monday.
