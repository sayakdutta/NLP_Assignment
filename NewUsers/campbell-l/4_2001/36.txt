Larry, I notice a posting for ENA East Power Service DE position in your area.  I would appreciate if you could give me a call concerning the position and any insights you may have about the Power Desk.  Also, if you could forward my resume to Edwin Coulter, it would be greatly appreciated.  Please keep this confidential.  Thanks, Jay
