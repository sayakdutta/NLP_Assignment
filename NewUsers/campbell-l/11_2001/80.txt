Ed I have been busy in Az and have neglected your email.  Sorry about that.  Is there a one page form that I can submit that will say that nothing has changed at a faility in the last 5 years for the below facilities?  Either that or I can write a one page letter stating this fact and reqeust that the OCD renew the permit again.  Which is best for you?
 

Here's a listing of the permits expiring over the next year or so:

	GW-90		Portales C.S.		Expires 2/27/02
	GW-89		Corona C.S.		Exprers 3/9/02
	GW-95		Laguna C.S.		Expires 3/9/02
	GW-109	Carlsbad C.S.		Expires 5/18/02
	GW-110	Mountainair C.S.	Expires 5/18/02
	GW-113	Eunice C.S.		Expires 6/19/02
	GW-283	Jal C.S.			Expires	6/24/02
	GW-285	Bisti C.S.		Expires 9/24/02

As you know, if you get your renewal applications in 120 prior to the
expiration date, the permit will not expire on the dates above, but will
extend until all paperwork is done on my end.

We need to go out and look at all of these at some point in time, but I will
get back with you to set up a schedule.

Take care and have a good Thanksgiving.

Ed
