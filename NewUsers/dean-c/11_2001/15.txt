I'll call you after the holidays.  I'd like to know which company and what your doing.
I'm staying at Brett's this weekend...even though he is Maryland.  Parents are building a home and moved into a Cracker 
Jack house for the next few months.

Interesting how we all turn out...   Give me a call when you get a chance.  New cell phone is 707-580-3020.  With a new company as of 3 months or so ago.
