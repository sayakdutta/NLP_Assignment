I don't believe that the agreement you had sent to me for Cochrane is the latest version. I thought we executed a new agreement with tiered volumes... can you have someone re-check this and get back to me.

We have faxed these.  Hope they help.

 

Eric, can you have someone fax to me a copy of the TCPL Cochrane shrink agreement and also the PC ( empress ) shrink agreement.  SPPC has asked me to help her figure out the deal she has and I need to refresh on paper issues. Don't know if there is a deal here or not? 

Thanks, BT
