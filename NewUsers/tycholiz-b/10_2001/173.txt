you know, can't trust those lawyers..... BT 

 

Its good to see Ray gets the same treatment from his own lawyer.

 

Spoke to Ray Welch.
They were supposed to meet with their lawyer yesterday - the lawyer never showed up.
They'll try to get their comments together in the next few days.
He mentioned that they were meeting internally on your transport swap structure Barry.
