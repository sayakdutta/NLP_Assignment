what date is this planned for. BT 

 

We would love to have you and Kim.  Might even be some snow by then.  Just let me know if you can make it so they can get a good head count.

 

I think we should still do this, and I may join you guys.

BT 

Dates please.



 

FYI

We are planning on joining Crestone for a combined Denver Christmas party.  The cost for our share will be approximately $1,000.  I know it is not cheap, but I think it is an important signal and morale booster which is critical at this time.  We have a long way to go in this deal.
