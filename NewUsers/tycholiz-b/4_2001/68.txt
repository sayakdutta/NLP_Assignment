My arguments remain the same regarding gas coverage. I believe that gas coverage responsibilities belong to west gas.  This coverage should be transitioned over to a marketing rep in west gas, and I would like that to be you.

Mark and Eric,

John Malowney here in the Portland office is trying to assist Louisiana-Pacific in financially hedging their overall gas exposure.  The attached e-mail and spreadsheet outline the basics.  Essentially, he would like to group their plants into 5 or 6 general pricing regions for parsimony.  At this point, we are looking for assistance roughly grouping these plants together.  Obvioulsy, If L-P is interested in this type of hedge, we will be contacting you for further assistance in obtaining quotes.  L-P has made it clear that they wish to deal with only one point-man at Enron and John has that role.  He is currently out of the office, so you should get back to me with any questions or needed clarifications.

Thanks for your assistance.  Please contact me by phone (503.464.8122) or e-mail.

Todd, if you're not the man that's fine but I'm hoping you are.... 

Attached is L-P's total natural gas volumes.  The plan is to financially hedge them at the various hubs in the $4.50 to $5.00/MMBTU range over a one year period.  They feel a longer time period would warrant a lower price/MMBTU.  I've listed the various states and or provinces but I have no idea as to the corresponding hubs.  I have already provided L-P with an ISDA which they are in the process of reviewing.   L-P would like to meet here in Portland to discuss our proposed plan on Tuesday April 24th.  Let me know when you want to discuss a game plan.  JOHN
