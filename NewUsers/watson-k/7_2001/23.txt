Kim/Morgan:

	Below is an update on our current progress.  Roger is available to meet with you, next week on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday.  If any of these days are convenient with your calendars then please let me know and we can set something up.  The 4 Seasons has been booked for the entire day and they will be providing us with 3 white boards for your afternoon brainstorming.  They were also able to accommodate our preferred lunch selection.  The Mad Potter has also been booked and they will be adding our deposit to the final bill.  I am finalizing the memo that will be sent out to all of your employees.  If you have any questions please let me know.  Thanks
