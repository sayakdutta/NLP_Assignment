Can we meet on Monday?  Perhaps after the TW staff meeting which ends about 3:30 to 3:45.  

Kim.

 



Thanks Kim,

Let me know when you have a few minutes to visit briefly. I know you're busy, so I won't take up too much of your time.

Jerry,

Steve Harris asked me to get with you and coordinate any outage planning input that you need from our group.  Please let me know how I can be of assistance. 

Thanks, Kim.
