Steve,  

Yikes, I thought you were on eSpeak the following week.  I am in Artesia on Tuesday the 6th and won't be able to help you.  I'll be sure to submit some questions for you to answer.

Sorry, 

Kim.

 


Let's  remember to take time to speak with Steve on "eSpeak", Tuesday, November 6, 10:00a.  If you have questions you'd like to submit prior to the broadcast, please feel free to forward them to me or Steve.

Transwestern Pipeline Company should be an interesting topic for discussion.
