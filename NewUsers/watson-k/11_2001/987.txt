Here is the protest-  MK

 

Attached is the CPUC's Protest, Notice of Intervention and Request for Tech. Conference and/or hearing filed yesterday in RP97-288-017.

The CPUC is protesting the revised tariff sheets filed Oct. 31.

In a nutshell, the CPUC argues "the fundamental issue that should be investigated  is whether the maximum recourse rate is in fact functioning as the FERC intended to assure fair and reasonable use of negotiated rates by a pipeline with market power."
