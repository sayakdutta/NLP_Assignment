After further discussion on this topic, we have decided to condition termination of the contracts so that Mavrix remains on the hook for reservation charges to the extent the subject capacity remains unsold or is sold at less than maximum tariff rates.  Attached is the termination agreement.  Thanks for your input.  Maria


Audrey, I will call you with instructions on executing originals.
