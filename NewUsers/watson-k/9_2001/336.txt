FYI, here is the cancellation of the Florence Hotel.  I hope to hear from the hotel in Positano and Rome (front end trip only) today.  Dennis, please confirm the cancellation of your front-end Sheraton hotel in Rome.  

Thanks, Kim.




WE HAVE TAKEN NOTE OF YOUR CANCELLATION.
WE HOPE TO SEE YOU NEXT TIME.
KIND REGARDS,
