Have you guys heard anything about shippers wanting gas at this point?  Let me know.  Thanks, Kim.

 



 

I'm with you.  If we can't make money, why enter into an agreement?   The team at Canadian is under the impression that they are going to be asked to run the units long term.   Not sure where this is coming from.
I think there are probably better places to put the units.




Randy:  I'm waiting to hear who has requested us to run the units, but if history is repeating, it is Duke wanting us to run them for 2-3 days to move their gas during an NNG outage.  I believe that even at maximum rates, we do not cover our costs.  No one in TW Marketing has heard from a shipper yet.  If it has been over a year since the units were last run, we have the option of abandoning them at any time.  What do you think?  Steve

I understand that there has been a request to run two units at this location beginning Thursday.  Is this a long term commitment?  I've been told that the units will need some work at some point if we expect them to operate on a daily basis.  




Mike Flynn - Canadian Team:  These units are candidates for abandonment.  What day were each of these units last run?  If they have been idle for over one year we can abandon the units under automatic blanket authority.  If we run them, however, it postpones the abandonment-under-automatic-blanket-authority option by another year.  Please let me know ASAP.  Steve
