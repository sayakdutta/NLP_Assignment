Steve,

FYI, the Risk Management and Reporting was allocated to TW for all 12 months of 2001.  However, since I came back to TW in May, Lee Ferrell left Enron in June and Sean and Richard moved to Jo's RC in November, the 15% number dwindled during the latter part of the year.  Martha and Bobby were the only ones in this RC that were part of this allocation all 12 months. 

Thanks, Kim.

 

 

Let me know if you have questions.  It may look confusing because there are TW cost centers listed also.

Je,  attached are the final 2001 actuals distribution %'s for the cost centers I am responsible for.  Please disregard the file I sent on January 21st.  

Please let me know if you have questions.
