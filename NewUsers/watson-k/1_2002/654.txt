Yes, 9:00am on Thursday will work fine.  Also, just FYI, Transwestern is off on a holiday, Monday, January, 21 for Martin Luther King day.

Talk to you Thursday,

Thanks, Kim.  :>)




It looks like Gaylen is going to take vacation on Friday, Jan. 18.  Would it be possible to move our conference call to Thursday, Jan. 17 at 9:00 a.m. your time?  If you have a conflict let me know - I'm sure we could call Gaylen on his cell phone on Friday.  Thanks Kim!
