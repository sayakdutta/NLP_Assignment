Mark and Mark,

We approve the costs to get real-time DTN feeds.  We would like to sign up for a 3 year agreement so that the $1,000 fee is waived.  We will have seven primary users right now:

Harris, Steven 
Lohman, TK
Lindberg, Lorraine
Lokay, Michelle
McConnell, Mark
Y'barbo, Paul
Watson, Kimberly

Thanks for all of your help on this.  Please let me know when real-time pricing can be installed.

Thanks, Kim.

Kim,

Below are the fees for the new DTN Nymex Price Feed for TW. Please let me know if you approve the fees and forward on to Mark Gigliotti for approval. He then will forward on to Steve Hotte and then Rod Hayslett. We then can cut a P.O. in iBuyit and faxed over to DTN to get the realtime feed started.

NYMEX 1st User Fee:			$60
