To All,

Please send me bullets by lunchtime on Thursday so I can give them to Steve by the afternoon.

Thanks, Kim.

Kim,  Steve is scheduled to take vacation on Friday of this week.   Would you please arrange to have all bullet items submitted for review by 3:30p on Thursday, January 10th?    

Thanks in advance,
