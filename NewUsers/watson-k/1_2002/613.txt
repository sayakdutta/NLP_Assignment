Ron, 

John would like to know what our HP is at these units and what type of units are they?  What is the age of the equipment?  Is this something we would be willing to share?  I told him that our run time on these units was less than 1,000 hours.  If we are OK sharing this info, would you either call him or email this to him.  If we don't want to share, just let me know and I would be happy to call him and let him know.  

Thanks, Kim.

Planning has discussed the possibility with Field Operations and have determined that TW could not justify converting all or part of either station to electric motor drive.  The total number of run hours in 2001 was about 700.  Most of that was at one station which would equate to less than a month total.  Concept was good but bad timing on location based on run hours.  I'm assuming you will pass this on to John Davis to break the bad news to him.  I'll do so if you want just let me know.
