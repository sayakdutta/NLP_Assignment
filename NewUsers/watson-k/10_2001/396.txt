John is for sure out of town, I think I will travel out with him for the weekend, but I have not confirmed it just yet.  If I find that I will be in town, I'll let you know.  Don't hold anything up for me. 

Thanks, Kim.

 

Is anyone interested?  Please let me know by COB tomorrow.  Thanks.

 

Lorraine:
