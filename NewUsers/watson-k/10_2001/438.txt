2001.




From whence shall we pick you up on Friday, assuming a 1 p.m. departure?
1400 Smith or 2001 Holcombe?




Sounds good. K.




I'm going to meet Gary at his house at noon on Friday, leave my car in
his
garage, then we'll drive down to pick you up (where?).  On Thursday I
can
swap cars at his house and bring mine home that night.
