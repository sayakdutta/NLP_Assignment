Do you have open conference rooms on your floor?  If not, we have a great conference room in 1336 that is just for us.

Just let me know.  Thanks, Kim.

 

Thanks Kim,  Friday 10:30 works well for Sue and myself.  Where would you like to meet?

 

How about Friday about 10:00 ro 10:30?

Kim.

 

Kim,
Per our conversation yesterday after the morning meeting, Sue and I would like to get together with you to go over Agave's plan for a future Park & Ride agreement.   Would you let us know what time is good for you? 

Thanks.
