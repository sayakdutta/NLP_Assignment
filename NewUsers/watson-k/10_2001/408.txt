Hi Kirk, 

I hope to have the revised contract for you late tonight.  Would you like to set up a time that Ron and I can go over it with you by telephone?  How about Monday or Tuesday?


Thanks, 
Kim.




Hi Kim-
Just wanted to check the status of the TW interconnect bids for Big Sandy (w
and w/o meter set, etc.).
Hope that you are doing well.
Best regards,
Kirk
