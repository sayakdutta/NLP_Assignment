I was informed by Lone Star that they have not completed their transaction with Sid Richardson and they will continue to take deliveries from TW until further notice.  (I suspect that they may not sell this asset, after all.)  Assume no sale for now, I will keep you posted if anything changes.  

Thanks, Kim.

Sorry -this should be Lonestar & not Longhorn.

It's my understanding that Transwestern currently has firm deliveries at the Lonestar Ward Co I/C which is bi-directional.  Lonestar is planning on conveying the line to Sid Richardson who will turn the line into a sour gas line.  As a result deliveries (&/or receipts) will no longer be made.   The Lonestar Ward Co I/C, is currently listed as a 311 point.    Upon Lonestar's conveyance of the line to Sid Richardson, the abandonment of the I/C point would be reported to FERC in the annual 311 Report only if ground disturbance would occur in abandoning Transwestern's facilities.
