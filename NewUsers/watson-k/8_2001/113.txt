Kay,

Thanks for the update.  Actually, I did not realize that Jeff's computer had Prophet X on it.  I would like to get together with you in the next few days and discuss the software package with you.  We may indeed wish to keep a user on it but I would like to understand it better.  I'm out of the office tomorrow, but will be back in on Thursday.

Thanks, Kim.

 

Steve and Kim,

Since Jeff Fawcett left, do either of you have an interest in giving his desktop access to Prophet X software (via the FIMI server)  to someone else in your group?  Since TW is still paying Jeff's user fee, I need to either have FIMI remove his permission from the server, or I can have them change the permission on the server to a different user.

Please let me know what you would like to do, and I'll take the appropriate action with FIMI.

Thanks,

Kay
