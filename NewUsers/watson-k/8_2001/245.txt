Audrey,  would you send an invite to Brad Holmes and Teb Lokey?  Thanks, Kim.  

Sorry, I tried hard to make sure we didn't leave anyone off.  

 

I would include Brad Holmes who is Ramona's Director (If you do not know him, I would take the time to chat with him.) and what about Teb Lokey.  

 

Donna, would you please check this distribution list and let me know if you think we might have accidentally omitted someone that should have received an invite?  I don't want to leave anyone out that should come.  Thanks, Kim.

 


Steve Harris would like to let you know that your hard work during the past few months has been sincerely appreciated.

A "Thank You Luncheon" has been scheduled to express this appreciation.  Please mark your calendars to attend a luncheon on Friday, September 7, 2001, from 11:30a - 3:00p at Jillian's, 7620 Katy Freeway.

We hope that each of you will be able to share this time with Steve and the TW Commercial Group.

Please RSVP to me by Friday, August 31.
