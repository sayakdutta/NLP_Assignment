Randy,

Listed below are some companies/individuals we have used in the past to provide translation services.  The first two would be the preferred.





interlingua - Muriel Dupont # 713-957-2040



If you are interested in using one these options I suggest we get a price quote first.  Since these people are scattered about in Houston, they like to do things over email if files are electronically available.  If not, I recommend using a courier service - such as City Central at 713-623-0303 (never had a problem with them).

If you have any questions or need any additional information please let me know.
