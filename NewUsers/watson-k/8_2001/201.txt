Hey guys and girls,

Janell has a Sheraton on the outskirts of town booked on the front end of t=
he trip.  I sent 17 faxes this morning to hotels in the city center looking=
 for something closer to our sights.  I received an immediate response from=
 the Hotel Condotti.  They have 3 standard rooms available.  I believe it i=
s a 3+ star hotel (I'm guessing from the prices they charge).  From the art=
icle in my book, they have recently remodeled.  They are located near our H=
otel Firenze between the Spanish Steps and Plaza Del Popolo.  The rate is 4=
30,000 Lire (approximately $215).  It's $25 more than the Sheraton but we w=
on't have to taxi between the city center and the outskirts of town which g=
ives us more flexibility to easily scoot back to the hotel as we fade with =
jetlag and eat dinner in town after a nap.  They also have a 72 hour cancel=
lation policy (there could be a slight fee to cancel, their fax just says t=
hey have a 72 hour cancellation fee), if we are OK, I'll confirm this cance=
llation with our reservation. =20

I think we should go with this.  I'm not sure how fast I'll hear from the o=
thers, if at all.=20

Please let me know your thoughts ASAP. =20

Thanks, Kim.
