Linda, you are so welcome!  I leave for vacation Wed., but when I get back, I'll call you.  I want to see your new digs!
 
Have a great week!
 
Thanks, Kim.





I just wanted say thanks for lunch the other day and as well of the ears.  It was great seeing you ya'll.  It's very busy over here today, give me a call and let me know when you would like to come over this week.  I will be taken Thursday afternoon off.
 

 
Thanks a Million for everything!
Linda
