Hi Jeff, 
 
John and I are also good to go for tonight.  We are open on flavors of food.  Some things that come to mind off the top of my head are:  Raven Grill, Goode Company (Mexican or BBQ).....I'm trying to think of some place that we could have drinks, beer or wine....we are completely open.  Any thoughts on some place close to your neighborhood?
 
John and I were planning on meeting at the house to join up.  I'll bring the maps/books etc.  Does 6:00pm sound OK?
 
Kim.





Kim, 

Lisa and I are certainly up for it.  I haven't given much thought to location yet, so put on your thinking cap and let's come up with place/time.  We're looking forward to getting together with you guys.  By the way, I'm in the office the rest of today and tomorrow if you want to give me a ring.

Jeff
