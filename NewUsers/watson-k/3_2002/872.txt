Mark,

After Earl met with Questar on last Wednesday Feb-20 my understanding is that:

1): TW will build all the necessary interconnect facilities and that Questar is responsible for total costs.

2):	In-service date is May-1 and that could be sooner if Questar will support us in purchasing materials

3): You have revised the agreement and it is based on the above term/ conditions

4): Earl has revised the Work.Order for routing and it is based on the above.


Am I correct on 1,2,3 and 4 ?

Thanks, Mansoor
