Sherry,

Thank you so much for your kind thoughts.  I sure have enjoyed working with everyone.  I will miss all the great personalities that we have assembled in ETS!  And, you can definitely count on me for being at The Nutcracker!

Thanks again, Kim  :>)

 

Kim, best of luck in your new endeavors -- hope to see you around at least The Nutcracker!!

Best regards,
Sherry
