I'm taking Dylan's and Mark's stuff, adding a bit, and putting it into memo 
format.  As I recall in class, he doesn't expect or want us to turn in 
answers to questions, per se, just a 4-page (or so) memo.  I have that 
right?  I'll circulate the memo later today, or first thing tomorrow in the 
AM.

Best,
Jeff
