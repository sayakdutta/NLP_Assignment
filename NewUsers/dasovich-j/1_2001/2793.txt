Greetings:

Attached is the draft.  I've attempted to capture everyone's comments.  The 
only piece that is not likely to go this evening is the piece providing 
comments on the Governor's specific proposals.  That will likely go first 
thing tomorrow morning.  You'll note that only one of the Governor's 
proposals currently has any comments attached to it.  Comments on the 
Governor's proposals are appreciated.  The remainder of the materials will go 
to the Governor's staff later this evening; so any and all comments on those 
portions are welcomed and appreciated.  Thanks to all for the assistance, 
particularly in light of the holiday.

Best,
Jeff
