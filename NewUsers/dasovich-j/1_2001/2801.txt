Thanks.  I think it makes sense to take out the reference to 15%.  It think 
the rest of it passes the "front page of the New York Times test," as the PR 
folks say.  Thanks again for your help on this.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff--looks good.

Is there any concern about our putting some of these thoughts in writing
and what might happen if that writing becomes public?  For instance, we
appear to advocate or at least agree with a 15% rate increase.  What
happens if that becomes public?  I will trust your and the PR group's
analysis of that issue--I just throw it out for consideration.  MDS
