We'll have an internal call to discuss this prior to launching any missiles.  
Jeanne, please have Mike give me a call to discuss.  Thanks.

I just got a call from Mike Day who is up in Sacramento where they are
considering legislation which would muck around with the TRA and TCBA
accounts.  The legislation, as currently drafted, would not undertake a
wholesale adoption of the TURN proposal to transfer all undercollections
from the TRA to the TCBA. 

Mike is trying to get hold of any analysis which was done which shows what
the current balances in the TCBA and TRA would have been if TURN's proposal
had been in place from day one. I know we put a halt on undertaking that
analysis when we learned that TURN was doing it for their testimony.
However, Mike seems to think getting something like that before the
legislature in the next few days may be critical.  If we had to undertake
it, how long would it take to get a product?

I have a call into Bob Finkelstein to see if they have already done the
analysis, but have not heard back.
