Greetings Kari:

Attached is follow-up information from the meeting that the Governor and you 
had with Ken Lay and Steve Kean last Thursday.  Tomorrow morning I will email 
three additional pieces of information:

Our specific comments on the proposals that the Governor raised at the 
meeting.
More details on the "demand buy-down" concept.
Information on Norway's version of the ISO, "Nord Pool."

If there's anything you need, don't hesitate to contact me at 415.782.7822.

Happy New Year.

Best,
Jeff
