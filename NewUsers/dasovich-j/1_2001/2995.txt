Tyson has had conversations with the Governor's office.
The Governor's office wants more information about what the meeting would 
"look like"/attendees, and has said that the idea sounds like one worth 
pursuing (but as we know, talk is very cheap with this Governor).
In response, Tyson and her very able helper are taking the 1.5-pager that I 
sent around and modifying it to describe the meeting 
optics/logistics/attendee attributes, etc.
They will forward it to me as soon as they've got it drafted.
Tyson hopes the document will seal the deal on the Governor's participation.
In the meantime, Tyson is trading calls with Doer and trying to line up other 
business face cards to assist in getting the business community to the 
table.  Any help/suggestions we can offer gathering up business folks would 
be useful, but seems that Tyson's going to have to carry that water.
Tyson said based on her conversations with Summers, he's squarely on board.
