Lamentably, I worked all week--no vacation time.  Thanks.

Sandi & Jeff,

I need to check with you both for "correct" Timekeeping concerns that I had 
input your hours correctly for last
week; that is, whether either of you ended up taking any time off last week.  
[Before I left, I had put you both 
down under "Work" hours for Wednesday through Friday (12/27 - 12/29).]

Please let me know today if I need to "adjust" any of your hours as 
referenced above.

Thanks!

Joseph
