Yes, I will let you know.  Mona was the one who agreed to this for ARM, so I 
thought she mentioned it to you.

if any of the associations are meeting with legislators, could we talk about 
it before hand to see if we want to have someone there?  The Latino Caucus is 
very important, and we have our own relationship with them..we want to make 
sure that they receive consistant messages
