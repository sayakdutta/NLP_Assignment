Jeff and Sue,
 
I have a potential lead which may be of interest to Enron.  However, I don't 
know if you have any interest in Eastern European projects.  
 
Who would you suggest talking to with regard to a Bulgarian power plant 
development?  It involves a 25 year requirements contract with the national 
energy company, the retrofit of two existing units and building three new 
hydro units.  Total around 450 MW.  Party with exclusive deal with government 

$160 million).  Any suggestions on how to proceed?  My guess is that few 
engineering companies are into financing these days, particularly in emerging 
nations.  However, what are your thoughts/suggestions?
 
Thanks, and Happy New Year!
 
Dan
