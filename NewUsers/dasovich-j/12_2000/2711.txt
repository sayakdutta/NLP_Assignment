I paged you yesterday with the info on size, construction start and 
in-service dates. You get it?

Attached is a draft letter.  I tried to get it down to one page, but it can 
use more reduction. I also need info on when the 750MW of capacity will be in 
service.  I am leaving on holiday, so someone (like Rick) will have to 
complete the letter.
