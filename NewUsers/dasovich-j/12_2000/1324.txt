Can we do a little planning tonite for this weekend? 

Cameron: 
Here are the directions to the place in Stinson.  Can you email to your 
invites?  Did you invite John E? 
We have the place from 5 PM on Friday evening till 10 AM on Sunday morning. 
Address: 
11 Sonoma Patio 
Stinson Beach 
If you're coming from the City and take Panoramic over Mt. Tam, then when 
you hit Highway One, make a right and head north toward town.  Go through 
town and make a left on Calle del Arroyo.  If you see the lagoon on your 
left, you've gone too far.  After making a left on Calle del Arroyo, make a 
left on Sonoma. 
If you're coming from points North, then you'll be heading south on Highway 
One toward Stinson.  After you've passed the lagoon on your right, you'll 
eventually come to Calle del Arroyo.  If you arrive in the town of Stinson 
Beach, you've gone too far.  Make a right on Calle del Arroyo, then a left 
on Sonoma.
