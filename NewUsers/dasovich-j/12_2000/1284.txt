Rick, Jim, Harry:

You will have the first status report for California by COB on Monday.  We 
will update that report weekly. If there's anything you need between now and 
Monday, please let me know.  Have a good weekend.

Best,
Jeff

FYI:  Yesterday, the California PUC rejected the utilities request to, among 
other things, raise rates and end the rate freeze.  The status quo prevails, 
at least for now.
