Professor Aceves:

Attached are a word and an excel file.  Both are formatted for easy print 
out.  Note that the excel file has two work sheets:  "balance sheet" and 
"income statement."  I'd be happy to provide you with a hard copy, too, if 
you would prefer a hard copy.  Just let me know.  Thanks for a great course.

All the best,
Jeff
