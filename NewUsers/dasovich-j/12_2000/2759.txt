That's a very good point.  I'll make the change.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff - instead of suggesting a specific rate increase - 10 or 15 %, I think 
we should acknowledge that a "modest" increase may be necessary and may in 
fact be desirable - but that the specific amount of increase should be 
reasoned and subject to well thought out evidence and hearings, not just 
determined by whim.  In general, we should not be overly prescriptive at this 
point and I know you agree with that.  Otherwise, I think you have captured 
the points excellently.
