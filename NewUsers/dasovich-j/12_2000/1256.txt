Hi Mary:
Well, the problem is likely just that I'm dense.  I log in, click on deferral 
and find a description of what one needs to do (i.e., fill out the form), but 
I've surfed around the site a bit and can't seem to find the form.  Am I 
(probably) missing something?  Thanks a bunch.

Best,
Jeff
