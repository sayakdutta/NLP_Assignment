Mike (Smith):
Since things will move pretty quickly from this point forward, we want to 
have a quick meeting to explore our legal options and how best to preserve 
them.  We'd like to have a kickoff call after the daily 10 AM (CST ) call 
that Wanda Curry handles.  Are you available after Wanda's call?  Say 11 AM 
CST?  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff
