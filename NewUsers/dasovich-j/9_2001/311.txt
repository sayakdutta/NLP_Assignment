Haven't heard anything about it, though Sue's been closer to these issues.

 

Do you know anything about this?  Can you offer any insights?

Diann and Mike,

Attached is a notice we propose sending to our customers that were overcharged UUT as a result of PG&E's billing practices.  Because of the UUT refund statute of limitations,  the sooner the notices are sent the fewer refund dollars our customers will lose.  

Please let me know if you would like to discuss the notice further or if it is acceptable for sending with the spreadsheets that Diann's group is putting together showing the amount of the potentially overpaid UUT.  

Thanks,

Jeff
