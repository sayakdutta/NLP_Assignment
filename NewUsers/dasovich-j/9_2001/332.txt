As far as i know, we can get together tomorrow night.




Hey, but when are you going to the dome tomorrow????  would there be time to get together?




couldn't agree more.  was just kidding.




sure, no prob, coke?  Really, truly, I intend to be quite normal and no fuss.  This is good for me.




meet for a drink after work?




Things is good. Our new ORA director is really engaging and starting to make some shifts around here.  good to have someone who cares, is competent, and tough.  
 
I'm off the bottle for a few weeks to get a true read on my cholesterol. Seems alcohol is processed first by the liver and is converted quite readily into fats that then become precursors to cholesterol ....  Feels good, easy to do......   




talked to karen.  thought we'd do bolinas weekend after your b-day.  andw e're around the weekend of your b-day, it's just that i've got class all day that saturday.  i think if karen's overly uncomfortable, we should just do the four of us.  we can always do dinner with david and nina.
 
how's things?





When you guys going to the dome? will we be able to get together for a few minutes before you depart on Friday?  Perhaps we could sit in front of one of your PCs and look a possible weekend spots for my b-day.

Also, I'd like to discuss the david thing....I'm interested in your view......
