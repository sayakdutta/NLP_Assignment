Really appreciate it.  I'll be up there this weekend.  If you, or one of your guys, want to drop by, I think that we could pencil it out in about 30 minutes.  Let me know if that works for you.  And thanks again.  Really appreciate it.

Best,
Jeff




Hello Jeff,

We're winding down a large project , about two more weeks, and preping
to begin another, but we should have a small window of opportunity to
get to your project, if you're still interested in having us do the
work.

So we need to meet or I need more info from you to get a good idea of
exactly what you want.

Please let me know.

Thank you!

Jim Docker
