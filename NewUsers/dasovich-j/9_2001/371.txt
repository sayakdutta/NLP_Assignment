My money's on Mirant/Reliant as the leak.

I talked to the LA Times, McGraw Hill and Bloomberg.  Found out that one of the five companies leaked the letter.  The LAT got comments from Reliant, Mirant, and Puget Sound.  McGraw Hill talked to Dynegy, and their comments were similar to ours. kd

An attorney for Reliant sent a letter on behalf of five Southern California Edison creditors (Reliant, Mirant, Dynegy, Enron, Puget Sound Energy) to SCE today requesting a meeting to discuss the terms of a forbearance agreement.  The following is the statement we are using with the media:


We are interested in getting paid and in discussing constructive solutions.  This letter is aimed at advancing that.  We have no plans at this time to participate as a petitioning creditor in an involuntary bankruptcy filing.  In fact, this letter is an attempt to avoid bankruptcy.
