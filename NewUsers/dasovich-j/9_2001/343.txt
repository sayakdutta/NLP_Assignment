Edison Utility Rescue-Plan Session Set for Oct. 9 by Davis
By Michael B. Marois 
Sacramento, California, Sept. 27 (Bloomberg) -- A special legislative session to consider a rescue package for Edison International's insolvent California utility won't begin until Oct 9., aides for Governor Gray Davis said. 
The governor had been expected to call lawmakers back Oct. 2. His aides didn't explain the reasons for the delay. The governor plans to make an announcement at 3 p.m. San Francisco time, Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said. 
Southern California Edison, California's second-largest utility, accrued $3.9 billion in debt under the state's deregulation law, which froze consumer rates and let wholesale power costs rise. Some of the utility's creditors are trying to put together a group of three to force the company into bankruptcy. PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric, the state's largest utility, filed for bankruptcy in April. 
The Legislature adjourned Sept. 15 without approving a $2.9 billion rescue package, prompting Davis to announce he would call lawmakers back to Sacramento to consider a new plan. 
The latest Edison measure may let the utility sell $2.5 billion to $2.9 billion in bonds to pay off its debt, secured by existing rates on about 20 percent of its largest commercial customers, Davis aides said last week.
