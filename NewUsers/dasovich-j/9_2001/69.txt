Here is a brief summary of the latest DA proposal floating around the Senate.  The provisions could--and likely will--change.  The leader of the Senate (Burton) is still expressing opposition to DA, so its fate remains unclear.  

No suspension of DA.
All customers must pay Edison undercollection, whether they've been DA or not.
Customers going DA must first clear any payables to DWR for power previously consumed but not full paid for.
Customers going DA must pay for DWR's stranded power costs caused by the customer leaving, UNLESS DWR has a net short position, in which case there would be no stranded costs and therefore no fees.
The bill allows customers to file a complaint with the PUC regarding DWR's claims of stranded costs.
Customers who choose green DA power (defined as 80% renewable) will be exempt from stranded cost fees so long as green DA load does not exceed DWR's net short position.
