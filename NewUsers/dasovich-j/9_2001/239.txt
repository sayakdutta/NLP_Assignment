Could you please refresh my memory of the other person in the group who's working on California?  Thanks a bunch.

Best,
Jeff

 

Jeff:

Works for me.  Thanks, Jennifer

 

For this week, we'd like to cancel both the Tuesday and Thursday calls and instead reschedule to Wednesday at 9 AM PDT (11 AM CDT).   We'll try to use the same call-in number. Scott, could you let Ken know of the plan?

Please let me know if this change presents a problem for anyone.

Best,
Jeff
