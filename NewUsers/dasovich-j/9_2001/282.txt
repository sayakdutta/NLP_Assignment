AReMers:

This memo from Angelides outlines what has happened and what still needs to
happen at the PUC before bonds can be issued.  He mentions that no appeals
to the DA suspension have yet been filed but that the deadline has not yet
passed.  When are we filing our appeal? I'd like to send out a news release
the morning we file the appeal if AReM agrees.

On another matter, just so we're all on the same page, Norm and I produced
the letter to Davis and legislative leadership which you all received
yesterday for final approval.  The Weintraub column handout has also been
mocked up and Norm is going to pick that up this morning from our office.
