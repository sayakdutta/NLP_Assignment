Greg:
Good talking to you.  Congratulations on your new role.  Sounds exciting (in addition to exhausting).

Based on our call, I contacted Perfect Commerce.  The two folks from their shop that will be in Houston are:

Ian Sullivan
SVP, Professional Services and all implementation of the product

Cameron Sellers
VP, Business Development

They'd like to meet sometime during the week of October 15th. Let me know if that works for you and Brad.  Or if you'd like to contact them directly, just let me know and I'll get you their numbers/emails.

I ran across Perfect when I was doing an MBA project--we were required to find a company that we could consult to on e-commerce strategy.

I've since found out that Perfect's doing a pilot with EES--acting as the e-procurment platform for products tied to EES' outsourcing deals.  From what I hear it's going well, and EES is enthusiastic.

The technology is very interesting:  soup to nuts e-procurement platform developed by Paul Milgrom (global auction guru and economist at Stanford).  Glad you guys can meet with them.  I think it's definitely worth the time--the technology may fit very well with Networks.

Best,
Jeff
