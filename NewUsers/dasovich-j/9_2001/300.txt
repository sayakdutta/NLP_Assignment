FYI.  Latest word is that Assembly, Senate and Administration staff have been locked in a room with orders not to emerge until they've struck a deal on the Edison MOU.  

Word on DA is not good.  Thus far it appears that the PUC "study" outlined in the letter from Burton & Co. to Lynch is as far as the Senate wants to go at this time, but folks continue to push.  Seems to be a possibility that, if the Legislature does reconvene, there may be a push by "green Senators" to pass a "green only" DA bill.

In addition, Lynch is setting the stage to have the PUC reject the rate agreement between DWR and the PUC on Tuesday.  This despite the Governor calling to vigorously lobby each of the commissioners.  Despite the strong arm tactics, it appears that Brown may be the only aye vote at this point.

The idea is that, if the PUC votes down the rate agreement, the only thing Davis will have left is 18XX.  

We'll report back with news as we get it.

Best,

I spoke to the three primary Senate consultants dealing with energy.  As of
9:30 a.m. this morning the Governor has still not officially called for a
Third Extraordinary Session, or, for the Second Extraordinary Session to
reconvene.  In fact, Senate staff is continuing to prepare for their annual
golf excursion next Tuesday. In addition, while staff from the Senate and
the Administration have met, the Administration has yet to produce either a
new version of SBX2 78, or, amendments to the existing version of SBX2 78.
Staff reiterated that they believe there is still no chance of passing SBX2
78 in its current form.
