Slight correction.  If, in fact, they actually come back next week, we'll likely stay with Tues/Thur.  If they end up NOT coming back, we may cancel regular call altogether, and continue for rest-of-year on "as needed" basis.  But we're still figuring and will get back to you.  We'll know more when we know more about what the heck the legislature is going to do, or not do.
 
Best,

Sorry, Ken.  SOmeone was supposed to call you yesterday.  I believe we're going to 9 am Wed weekly calls.  We'll be setting up a call-in number for it.




Is there a conference call today?  I couldn't get into yesterday's call; the code didn't work and the operator had no other record of a call.
