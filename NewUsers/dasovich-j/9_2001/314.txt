talked to karen.  thought we'd do bolinas weekend after your b-day.  and we're around the weekend of your b-day, it's just that i've got class all day that saturday.  i think if karen's overly uncomfortable, we should just do the four of us.  we can always do dinner with david and nina.
 
how's things?





When you guys going to the dome? will we be able to get together for a few minutes before you depart on Friday?  Perhaps we could sit in front of one of your PCs and look a possible weekend spots for my b-day.

Also, I'd like to discuss the david thing....I'm interested in your view......
