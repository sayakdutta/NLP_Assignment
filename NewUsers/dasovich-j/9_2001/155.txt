Attemps are still underway to persuade the California PUC not to suspend DA at today's meeting.
However, the best information we have at this time is that the PUC will suspend DA today, but will not suspend DA retroactively.
As best we can tell, if the PUC suspends, it will suspend DA effective today, September 20th.
In addition, there is a considerable effort underway--from both ends of the spectrum--to persuade the PUC to reject 1) the proposed rate agreement between the PUC and DWR and 2) the proposed "revenue requirement" that DWR submitted to the PUC.

We'll report back with the results of the PUC business meeting as soon as we hear them.

Best,
Jeff
