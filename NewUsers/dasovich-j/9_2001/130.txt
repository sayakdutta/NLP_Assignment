Jeff:  Ross is out for the week.  Is there someone who Ross works for that I could contact?  Thanks much.

Best,
Jeff

 

I have passed your voicemail to Ross Mesquita (Manager, EnronOnline) who is now looking at Business opportunities for DealBench.  About 2 months ago, we decided to discontinue external commercial activities for DealBench and evaluate strategic alternatives with respect to monetizing the platform.
Feel free to follow up with Ross.
thanks,
Jeff
