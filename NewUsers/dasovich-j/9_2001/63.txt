DWR filed comments with the California PUC today urging the Commission to adopt a July 1 suspension date.
In addition, DWR takes the position that, if the Commission does not enact a July 1 retroactive suspension date, the Commission should require that all customers who went DA after July 1 pay a proportionate share of the bonds and DWR going-forward contracts.
Customers and providers will strongly oppose DWR's proposal at the PUC.

Best,
Jeff
