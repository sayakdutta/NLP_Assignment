No problem here.  That price is making DWR's contracts look worse and worse every day.  Poor California.  Jeff, if you have questions or want to discuss further, don't hesitate to call me or Sue, though Paul can likely answer most questions.

Best,
Jeff

I don't see an issue with this.  I've cc'd Jeff Dasovich and Sue Mara to check in with them (while I can see California's pulse on the monitor, they actually have their hand on California's throat)!!!

Mike & Paul,

I have been asked by a consultant to the San Francisco Local Agency Formation Commission to provide a notional number for a 400 MW power supply at NP-15 starting 01-01-02 for 5 years. I had Jeffrey Oh price this but I do not want to send a term sheet until I am sure your OK with this. The situation is that LAFCO has initiated a "30,000 ft. level feasibility study of a measure that is on the ballot to form a new muni in San Francisco and Brisbane. 

Jeff

 

The price for 7x24 power for NP15 for Jan-02 through Dec-06, 400 MW, is $35.85.
