Strange.  I think that I received an email from someone with the report 
attached.  Let me scour my emails.  If and when I find it, I'll forward.  
Disheartening that you can't find a document that's getting so much press.  
Great website...

Hey, not so fast...  I did try to retrieve that info from the site prior to 
the call but had no luck finding it.  Most of what I could find on their site 
dated back to 1999.  Any other ideas?

Greetings:  How's things?  Got your message.  Best place to get your hands on 
the report is the CalPX website.  If you have any problems, let me know.  
I'll try to write a note discussing our conversation on Friday by end of day.

Best,
Jeff
