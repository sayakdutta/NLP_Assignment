Couple of brief comments:

1) There is a new and growing drum beat to reduce California's wholesale 
price caps further (i.e., below $250, with some suggesting $100).  We need to 
discuss strategy very soon.
2)  I'm attempting to arrange a meeting between ENA (Calger) and Sempra (CFO) 
to discuss commercial opportunities.
