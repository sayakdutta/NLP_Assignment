Here's the next version of the slides.  Few points:

There are a few holes (pre-quals and process in particular)--my brain began 
to fail.  But I think there's enough of a structure so that we can easily 
finalize by tomorrow.
I didn't have an electronic version of Whaley's slides, so I couldn't 
integrate them.  But I don't think it will take much to do the integration.
Some of Whaley's slides have a strong marketing slant--we should think hard 
about whether we include them lest we lose our mantle of objectivity.
We still have some wordsmithing to do re: participate, run the auction, or 
participate and run the auction.

Best,
Jeff
