Vail???  Flagstaff??? Man, I'm in the wrong business.  Now listen Stumpy, if 
you think you're going to Vail so some half-#%$#ed customer can run over your 
OTHER knee with a snow mobile, right before your wedding, well think again, 
buster.

I'll see if we can set up a meeting on Thursday the 2nd.

Signed,
Stuck in Lodi Again

Jeff,
Got your voicemail and I think you've got the right idea.  I spoke with the 
lovely Ms. Scott and she and I agreed that: (1) we don't want to endure a 
marathon afternoon (or two) of PG&E preaching the Gospel according to Baja 
Path, and (2) a more compressed 2-hour, mano-y-mano visit with Mr. Cherry to 
discuss Enron's and Transwestern's position in the Gas Accord would be much 
more useful to all parties.  Given the fact that TW has another customer 
meeting next week in Vail, and I've made a tentative commitment to meet with 
a customer in Flagstaff the following week, the only time I can reasonably 
fit in a trip to visit PG&E would be to arrive Wed. night, Nov. 1, and meet 
Thursday a.m., Nov. 2.  (Remember, I'm getting married that Saturday, Nov. 
4th!!!)

If we can't work this schedule out, then, in order to include me, we'll have 
to wait until I get back in mid-November.  If you think TW needs to get the 
face time a little earlier, maybe you and Ms. Scott can meet with him without 
the benefit of me dragging you down. 

Will you get back with us?  Thanks.
