Based on last nite's discussion, here's the coordinator list:

Christine--11.6--Teltronica
Dylan--11.13--Nutra
Kim--11.1--Agro Feed
Jeff--11.27--Global Industries
Jimmie--12.4--Daimler-Benz

We also decided that:
1) we'd continue with the SF/East Bay split 
2) each group should combine the answers into one document prior to sending 
to the coordinator for final compilation
3) we'd distribute draft answers to the entire group, since some questions 
feed off of others
4) we'd get finalized responses to the coordinator no later than 4 PM on 
Sunday

Let me know if this tracks with others' memories.

Best,
Jeff
