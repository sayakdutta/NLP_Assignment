FYI:  Got a call from a colleague who told me that Loretta Lynch and Rod 
Wright, among others, spoke at yesterday's annual meeting of regulation 
lawyers.  The following sums up what was very briefly relayed to me about 
Pres. Lynch's and Rod Wright's remarks:  

President Lynch said that 1) de-regulation was founded on ideology, not 
facts; 2) she wants to completely re-organize the PUC, top to bottom (in her 
image?  Amen); 3) she frowns on lobbying---"If you come knocking on my door, 
that's a strike against you.  One should participate, along with the rest of 
the public, through the hearing process."

Rod Wright sounded a more positive tone, stating that businesses (including 
Enron) are being frustrated by rules and regs that act as unnecessary 
impediments to plant development.  He made the point that the rules and regs 
need to be made more rationale and streamlined.  Apparently, he's still 
clinging to the idea of the State getting in to the power plant development 
business by signing contracts with providers.
