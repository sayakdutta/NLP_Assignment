Susan Scott is a senior attorney with the pipeline group (TW).  I met her as 
part of the California PUC's gas restructuring case.  For some time she's 
been inquiring about Government Affairs.  She called me yesterday and 
mentioned that she's very  interested in exploring if there are any 
opportunities in GA.  From my experience, Susan is highly competent and very 
professional and I think TW would say the same.  She likes her work but wants 
a new challenge.  I told her I'd inquire about whether someone would be 
interested in talking with her. I think that it would be useful for you to 
chat with her.  Thoughts?  Susan would like to keep it confidential at this 
point.
