Agree completely.  Notion I had was that we give Rebecca the slides, tell her 
the story on background, then she trots off to interview McNeally, Ellison, 
etc.  Just a thought.  Might be easier, faster channel that achieves the 
quick action/message we're looking for.

I don't disagree with Jeff that the WSJ would be a great message point.  I 
would recommend, however, that one of Enron's allies interview for the 
story.  For Enron to speak for the hi-tech industry is a bit questionable.  
Better if we can approach Intel or Sun now and ask them to talk with R. Smith.

FYI.  Rebecca got back in touch wanting to talk about the history of dereg in 
California.  Been trading messages.  When she gets back to me with what she 
wants to discuss, I'll check back in before having the conversation.  
Question:  What about giving her a copy of our high tech slides with the 
intent of getting her to do a story on it?  She might be a good "carrier."  
Thoughts?  One story has already hit the SJ Mercury News.

Best,
Jeff
