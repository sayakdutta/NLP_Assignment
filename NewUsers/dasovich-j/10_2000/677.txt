Thanks for the dinners, and the breakfast, and the company.  It was fun.  And 
don't get cranky, but I'm going to be in and out of things this weekend since 
I have midterms Monday and Tuesday.  Likely means that I'll be studying in 
Berkeley and SF during the days on Sat and Sun but will be present for the 
evenings.  H0pe that works.

Kisses,
Jeff

PS I'm trying, lord knows I'm trying, to stay out of it, but it's going to 
start raining up at the Dome very, very soon.......
