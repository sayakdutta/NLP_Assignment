So it is the 2nd after all?  Thought it might be the first, which I could 
have made.  The 2nd doesn't work---have set up a meeting with ENA to meet 
with Sempra execs to see if a deal can be done (yeah, right).  But since it's 
that early on the 2nd, I can call in by conference call and attend the first 
90 minutes, or so.  Will that work?

In other exciting news, going to meet with the lawyers and Bowen either this 
afternoon or first thing in the morning tomorrow.  You want to join?  And 
should I see if Scott and/or Donald want to attend?  Just let me know.

Best,
Jeff
