ENA also sold 100 MW of peak power (6x16) to PG&E for 5 years beginning in 
January of 2001 delivered in NP15.  They declined our offer for flat (7x24) 
power delivered in NP15 of $50.90/MWh.  The trade press is claiming that they 
purchased 400 MW from Calpine delivered in the new Greater Bay Area zone for 
around $51/MWh.  I believe that these values are lower than the current 
generation component of PG&E's frozen rates.

PG&E procured these MW's through a traditional rfp.  This is a pretty clean 
bilateral deal done outside of the PX.  We papered the deal using the EEI 
master agreement.










	

In case word hasn't gotten around, ENA learned COB Friday, that it has been 
chosen to engage in further negotiations with the ISO for about 450 MWs of 
projects.  The preliminary award is based on ENA's response to the RFQ that 
the ISO issued last month for "emergency resources."
