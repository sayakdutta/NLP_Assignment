Hi Delaney:

I won't need a room.  Did you want me to participate on a panel?  If so, 
which day and at what time?  Who else will be on the panel?  Inquiring minds 
would love to know.

Best,
Jeff

Folks-
The room reservation deadline at Villagio Inn & Spa is OCTOBER 13th. If make
reservations after this date, there is no guarantee there will be rooms
available. Also, please register as soon as possible as we are trying to
finalize all details of meals, meeting space, etc. Please make my life
easier :-)

If you have any questions about the retreat, please email or call me. I look
forward to seeing you all in November.

Thanks,
Delaney

P.S. In case you golfers forgot or did not get the notice, golf this year is
at the Chardonnay Golf Club on the exclusive Shakespeare Course. Hint, hint,
hint.......
