Hi Christine:

Yes, forwarded the email you sent last week.  Here's where folks came out.  
First, we think that the folks in your first group are mean.  Second, it's a 
real challenge managing a group of four and there's concern that five will 
break the camel's back.  Suggestion came up that it might be much more 
mangageable if you could try to link up with a smaller group first.  If 
there's a problem finding a smaller group, then we could try to do five and 
hope the ship don't sink?

Sound reasonable?  

Best,
Jeff

Jeff,

Have you had a chance to convey what I said to the group, and can I join?
Professor Aceves was aware that I talked to you about joining your group, and
he sent me an email asking to confirm that I was now in a group. I'd certainly
like to be! As you know, I want to make sure I am in one to do the next
assignment with. Please let me know, so that if I am joining your group I can
make the meetings and contribute to the next case. I do really appreciate your
help. :)

Thanks,
Christine
