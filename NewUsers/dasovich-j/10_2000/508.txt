Couple of thoughts:

In light of all the events that have transpired yesterday and today, seems 
that the IOUs have decided to up the ante considerably (likely in response to 
a pounding they're taking from Wall Street). This will likely increase the 
pressure for Davis to act sooner rather than later, at least w.r.t. finding a 
way out of the IOU undercollection problem.   The increased pressure to act 
in turn increases the likelihood that a bad solution will emerge.   Regarding 
the call on Monday with Davis, the added heat being applied might argue for 
coming up with a simple, concrete proposal that we can hand to Davis and that 
he can implement immediately to get the IOUs off his back and avoid having 
the adminstration cook up something less preferable.
