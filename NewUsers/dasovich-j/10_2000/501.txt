real meaning real acacia.  don't care about labeling.  what would you compare 
to in quality?  seems to me that one can't beat $5/bottle for acacia, non?  
what cheese?  man, you saw a great game.  i was portland for the past couple 
days, saw some of the game yesterday at the airport (plane was delayed).

GO GIANTS!

How real do you need?  It is Acacia chard that was supposed to be special 
labeled which means it was done for a restaurant or some special client and 
some of the deals fell through!  It's not the best but it is very good 
especially for the price!  Are you going with PP to do the cheese or does the 
cheese shopper stand alone?
 

If it's truly the real thing.  I'll take two cases.  Thanks for asking.

Dad/Eldon is going to get some Acacia Chardonnay for $5 per bottle.  We had 
some at Hopkins last night and it was really very good.  It is unlabeled 
but it is Acacia chard.  I know you don't drink a lot of white wine - but 
you might want some around.  Let us know - he needs to order it before he 
goes and he is going to try to go tomorrow. 

Cameron - I need a few days to make any arrangements you want me to do in 
Italy - so please let me know. 

I will be out of the office the rest of the day.  Home around 6 or 7.
