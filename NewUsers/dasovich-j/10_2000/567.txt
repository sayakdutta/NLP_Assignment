Bowen called, and unless he has to schedule a call with a judge from Texas at 
the same time, we're on for 9:30 AM.  He'll call back if there's a problem.  
Also, he confirmed my recollection on the dedicated transport v. AFTS and 
also confirmed that we can change any names we want and that this is the best 
time to make sure what we file in good ol' CA is consistent with our other 
filings.

Best,
Jeff
