Jeff:

As a reminder, note that the Quarterly Fee Reporting Statement you
received and  forwarded to us and Enron Accounting technically needs to
be submitted to the CPUC/State by October 15, 2000.  If it is indeed all
Zero's for amounts billed, then you should still fill in zero's and send
it to Sacramento sometime before Nov. 15, 2000 (penalty would attach as
of 11/15).
