Jeff,

I wish I could find it in my heart to care about the World Series.  But I
cannot!  So I won't take your negative sentiments personally.

Excellent.  We've been wondering why we've been excluded from the bob-zine
mailing list.

Bob:  Nothing personal but I hope both NY teams lose in the world series.

Best,
Jeff

Didn't know you asked.
