My understanding is that the cap is $2500, but that the PX has filed with 
FERC to change it ot $350.  My understanding is that FERC has not acted on 
the request to change it to $350, but I could be wrong.  Dave, Mary, is this 
your understanding?

Dave Parquet read a story we have for ENA's customer magazine, Exchange, 
about California Power problems.

He says we may have the price cap wrong for the PX.  We have $2,500 for the 
PX and $250 for Cal-ISO.

Are those figures accurate? He says the PX applied to FERC for a $350 cap.

Please advise ASAP as this publication has gone to press and I'm not even 
sure we can change it.

Thanks,
Jeannie
