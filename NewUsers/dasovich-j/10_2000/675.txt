Good morning professor:
Unfortunately, I'm traveling on business today (it's raing in Vancouver) and 
can't attend class tonite.  I was wondering if you'd be distributing the take 
home midterm in this evening's class.  Also, could you resend the access code 
for the Craftmade case?  I believe that I copied it down incorrectly.  Thank 
you very much.

Best,
Jeff
