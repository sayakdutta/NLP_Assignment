Tim:  I've worked hard with these guys to try to make this conference the 
best that it could be, but it ain't quite there.  So I'd rather keep our 
powder dry and use Skilling at another time.  Not top-shelf enough in my 
view.  If you want to discuss further let me know.

Also, one question:

Is the BEEP stack the constrained supply curve post-adjustment bids?  I have 
that right?
