April:  Could you please distribute this to the office?  Thanks a bunch.

Greetings Folks:

Tired of thinking about related-party transactions, SEC probes and re-stated earnings?  

Well, here's a chance to take your mind off of things.  I've got a pair of exceptional 49er tickets--lowest section in 2nd tier, right on the 50 yardline. (My girlfriend's parents season tickets. I can't use them--in fact, ain't crazy about football)  They're playing the Saints, which will be a great game.  

I'm selling them for face value, which is $50 each.  Like to be able to give them to someone in the office if possible.  If you're interested, please let me know ASAP.

Best,
Jeff
