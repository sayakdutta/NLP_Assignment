Thanks for the note.  Just let me know.  We'll do it when you're ready.  Between now and then, could you send me a summary (understanding that it's an estimate) of time and materials as you see them.  Thanks again.  Good luck with the other jobs.  Talk to you soon.

Best,
Jeff




Jeff,

We're still here, just to let you know.

Have been working on a small project which has evolved into something
quite larger as the owners keep adding more. We still plan on doing your
project, but I can't leave the current one until finished.

I will stay in touch.

Best Wishes,

Jim Docker
