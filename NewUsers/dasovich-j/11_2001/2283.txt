Greetings Dan:  Few things.

Chris Warner did an extremely good job of talking about your plan at DJ's thing in Yountville.
Thanks a million for helping to identify someone who's a bit more "outside the box" to help on the Lodi power plant/gas storage deal.  Any indication of who that person might be? We're anxious to start meeting with them.
Any word on getting a conference call together with the large customers?
Finally, have you told the PUC yet that you won't be filing any stinking GRC?  If so, how have they reacted?

Have a great holiday weekend.

Best,
Jeff
