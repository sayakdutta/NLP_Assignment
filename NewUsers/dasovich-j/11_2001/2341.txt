boy, you really did save this stuff.  i don't know who the author is, but, man, what a wit!











ok, just so you don't worry,and so that this thing doesn't get out of
hand, prentice and i have worked things out.  as part of the divorce
settlement, i get the fresia, and weekend visiting rights to the
tulips.  half of all potting soil will go to the sellers' family, with
the other half going to mine.  we're still negotiating about placing
the wheel barrow in a blind trust.

hope your meeting went well.
