Greetings.  I'm assuming that we're still on for the call.  Let me know.  Hope things have calmed down somewhat since the deal was announced on Friday.

Best,
Jeff

 

Understanding that many things can change dramatically between now and next Thursday, we are nonetheless scheduled to call Jim Scilacci at 4 PM CST on Thursday, November 15th. 

Best,
Jeff
