Sue and Jeff --

After reviewing ALJ  Barnett's Ruling again, it appears that the PHC
statements are restricted to which of the four areas he as identified for
discussion should go to hearing and why.  Attached is an outline of what we
are thinking of putting in for Enron. Please circulate to any one you think
needs to see it at Enron and provide input as soon as you can.
