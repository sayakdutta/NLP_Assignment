Per Senator Battin, he may ask for a vote on Tuesday for SBX 47 even
though he doesn't have the votes.  Senator Bowen has been dragging her
heels and he's tired of waiting, especially because he sees little if
any hope for the bill at this point.  With the exception of the wind
folks trying to cut a separate deal, this leaves the QF issue wide open
in the Legislature.

Regarding SBX 27, WSPA just met with Senator Bowen's staff and came away
from the meeting with the distinct impression that Bowen has no
intention of moving this anytime soon unless the bond council who she's
consulting signs off.
