FYI:  The City of Long Beach has now joined in the law suits.  They've sued 
SoCalGas and El Paso claiming (like the others who've sued) that the two 
conspired to "kill competition" and drive up prices.  I think that we can 
expect that topic to get some airtime, since the TURN's, Harvey's, UCAN's 
etc. of the world will likely be steering all the Democrats.  

I'll throw some questions together; but won't be till the end of the day.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff --

Can you please develop a list of questions for Legislative members to ask in 
the Gas hearing?

I would give the soft ball questions to PG&E and SoCal Gas and focus on the 
CPUC as the problems.
