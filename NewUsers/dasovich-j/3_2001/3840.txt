Steve/Lisa:

Environmental issues and the permitting will be the biggest (and could be 
very big) obstacles---particularly given the Santa Barbara location (e.g., 
Channel Islands, etc.).  Might be a good idea to have GA look into that side 
of things.  If we feel that can be overcome, then the next big deal will be 
getting transportation agreements with SoCalGas.  Finally, the issue you 
raised Steve---will Davis want to be the counterparty?---will loom somewhat 
large.  Overall sounds like an exciting idea/opportunity.

Best,
Jeff
