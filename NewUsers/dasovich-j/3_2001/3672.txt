ALJ Michelle Cooke has just issued the attached ruling in the SRAC  
proceeding which requests that DWR provide the following information:

1. The total number of megawatt-hours that DWR has contracted for on  behalf 
of California utility ratepayers;
?
2. The total dollar cost of those contracts.
?
The information has to be provided in a sworn declaration by March  19.? 
Nothing is said about confidentiality, but is reasonable to expect  that DWR 
may seek to provide the information solely to the Commission, rather  than to 
all market participants.
