Greetings:

There will be a PR call on Monday at 10:00 to discuss specific PR strategies
this week under the Market Response group. We will be discussing
distribution development and the Cal Journal ad for April as well as provide
an update on the polling.   We will send out a more detailed agenda this
weekend.

Conference Call in Number:
   1-800-486-2460


Pass code:

120895

It is important to note that this call is separate from the "Public Affairs"
call set up for 3:00 on Monday to discuss process, etc. From now on we will
also refer to the PR/Market Response team as the Public Affairs committee.
