Margaret:  Congratulations.  Sounds very exciting.  You will be sorely, 
sorely missed.  Your family's (immense) gain is Enron's loss. It's been an 
incredible pleasure working with you.

Best,
Jeff

Hi to my  friends and  associates here at Enron!!!  After  14  great  years  
at  Enron I am retiring soon to spend  time  with my husband and family  and 
to have more  time to  travel,  to  do   watercolor paintings  and  work on 
my art website.
