Attached is a rough draft of some scenario development around the PX credit 
and rate issues.  Few points:

Apologies in advance for any errors and inaccuracies.
Given time crunch, the model developed is quite crude and will need 
refinement (to be sure).
The bankruptcy scenario is included (scenario 4), but (again, given the time 
crunch) has not been analyzed to the same extent as the other scenarios.  
Tribolet should be able to provide good insights there, however.
The exposure has not been calculated since GA does not have the numbers, but 
EES should be able---once there's agreement on scenarios and 
probabilities---to run the numbers very quickly.
I've assigned my view of what the probabilities are.  These are key inputs 
and the team will need to scrub them thoroughly.
For ease of use by all, and given time considerations, I've done the 
conceptual model in word format, rather than excel.  It will be simple to 
translate this conceptual model to a spreadsheet model (in excel).

Best,
Jeff
