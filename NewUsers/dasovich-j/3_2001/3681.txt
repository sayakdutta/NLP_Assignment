That's the right story.  Only thing I'd be prepared for is the following, 
"OK, Mr. Belden, California's stupid, they did it wrong, and your company 
told them so right at the outset.  Does that give you the right to rob 
California's consumers and businesses blind?"  

Regarding the story with Peace quoted saying "we exported our stranded costs 
out of state."  I recall seeing that story on several occasions.  Karen, do 
we have someone who can do a search (lexis/nexis) and find those articles?  
Shouldn't be too tough.

Best,
Jeff

I am giving a speech in Santa Fe in a couple of weeks.  One of the points 
that I want to make is that California set up the rules, made a strategic bet 
to go short, decided to buy all of their power on the spot market, and is now 
crying that their massive bet didn't work.  I remember reading an article in 
the San Diego Tribune from sometime in 1998 or 1999 with a quote from Steve 
Peace.  Peace talked about how the state of California ripped off a bunch of 
dumb out of state generators and wisely solved their stranded cost problem.  
Does anybody remember this article?  Does anybody have this article?  Is 
there a service that we can use to find it if we don't have it?  Let me know.
