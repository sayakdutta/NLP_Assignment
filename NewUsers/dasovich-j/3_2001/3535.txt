Sue Mara was correct on the call yesterday.  While the PUC meets regularly on 
Thursdays, it appears they are having a meeting today at which the "Bilas 
Alternative" is up for a vote.  Our information is that there is some 
likelihood that the decision will be approved----but please don't hold your 
breath.  We'll disseminate information just as soon as we get it.

Best,
Jeff
