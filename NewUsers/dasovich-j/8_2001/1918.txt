David is in NY and will not be back until Wed.  

Jeff, I did leave David a voicemail with the information for the meeting in Sacramento and I told him to confirm with me if he would be able to attend.  I am still waiting for his confirmation.

Dave and I are supposed to be in a meeting in Sacramento with John White at 1 PM in Sacramento.  So the timing may be tight.  Perhaps we could do 4 PM?

Best,
Jeff

Cristina, I am not sure what either Dave's or Jeff's schedule looks like but wanted to see if either would be available for a meeting  with Michael Tribolet and myself on Wednesday afternoon in SF.  Could you let me know.  It would likely be after 3:30 in the afternoon.
