Thanks.  She called me.  It's the 29th at 1 pm.  It's at John's office, but I don't have the address. Could you get the address and email it to me, Christina and Dave Parquet?  Greatly appreciated.  I'm in Sacramento today.
 
Best,
Jeff




Jeff,
 
Marilyn from John White's office indicates she has you down for *two* appointments with Mr. White and Jan McFarland --

 
Please let me know which one you want to keep and I'll call her to reconfirm (do you need the location too or is that already known?)
 
Thanks,
