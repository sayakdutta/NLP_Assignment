Jim, Jeff, and Tim,
I hope all is well.  I often wish I were on the
Portland trading floor in that gov't affairs job but
that's history and my family is here in DC where they
correctly thought they belonged.  I'm writing because
I just interviewed to be Pat Wood's technical advisor,
one of FERC's top positions, and wanted to alert you
that I mentioned you and your group as a reference.  I
hope that is ok; in my view we parted on good terms. 
He gave me the impression that I am very much in the
running.  I don't know if Enron people are applying
and don't want to compete with them.  But I think I'm
generally on the same page with you on policy issues
and I expect you would favor having more familiarity
with markets and market-oriented policies on staff
there.  Given your companies longstanding relationship
with Wood I thought you might be consulted on this. 
If so, I am asking for your support.
Thanks!
