I just got it.  I'll fax it.  Trying to read, but am currently reading the latest version of SB 78, which we just got and Scott has faxed.  Jim, here's the latest.  It's going to be heard this afternoon, per Scott's note.  It is not clear whether 1) it's going to make it through the Legislature, and 2) if it does make it through, whether Davis will sign.  It's very tied up with/linked to the other measures (Edison bailout, etc.).  Am trying to get more info, but that's it at this point.  Will report back on what happens at the hearing on the bill.

Best,
Jeff

Jennifer --

Can you get a copy of the SBX2 1 and provide short synopsis?

Thanks,

Jim

 

The following energy bills will be heard today.

SBX2 78 (Polanco/Sher), SCE MOU, will be heard by the Assembly Energy, Costs
and Availability Committee upon adjournment of the Assembly Transportation
Committee (approximately 2:30 p.m.) in room 437.  Late Friday, Assemblyman
Hertzberg informed his caucus that the Assembly may take this measure up on
the floor as early as today.  Because floor session is currently scheduled
for 11:00 a.m. this would require the Assembly to reconvene late this
afternoon, however, this has not been scheduled and such an action would
likely interfere with several Assembly fundraising events this evening.

SBX2 1 (Soto/Scott), windfall profits tax, will be heard by the Assembly
Revenue and Taxation Committee at 1:30 p.m. in room 126.

SB 532 (Sher), renewable portfolio standard, will be heard by the Assembly
Natural Resources Committee at 1:30 p.m. in room 447.  This measure would
require DWR and/or the IOUs to purchase specified amounts of renewable
energy.
