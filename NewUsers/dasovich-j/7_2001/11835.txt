Thanks, Hedy. Barring any strange turn of events, we're likely to be OK with 
the language.  The budget--and the R's desire to mess with Davis--appear to 
be delaying things somewhat.  If tomorrow Loretta holds the DA decision till 
the 12th, that will buy some additional  (and necessary) time to work a deal. 

Best,
Jeff

Senator Burton's office expects bond language back from Legislative
Counsel sometime tomorrow, Tuesday.  As soon as we get a copy we will
forward it.  If the language is acceptable to Enron, then Bev, Scott and
I need to visit with Republicans to urge their support as soon as
possible.We are continuing to coordinate with the big users and some
other suppliers on this issue.
