John:

Here are two alternatives to the language in AB1X.

The language does two things:

1) ensures that DA customers' costs are shifted to utility customers.
2) ensures that DA customers' don't unfairly escape any costs (e.g., bond 
payments, etc.)

We're assuming that you'll shop these with Lenny and we'll work the Reps on 
SB 18?

Lemme know.

Best,
Jeff
