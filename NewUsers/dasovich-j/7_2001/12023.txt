Harry --

Can you track down this bill and determine impact?  We'll discuss on Thursday.

Is AB 23XX moving with a chance of passage?   I just learned that this
Pescetti bill that was AB 1425 was revived as a 2X bill.  It is very
anti-competitive, and could hurt a number of TW, EES, or ENA gas deals by
binding customers to 100% utility service through the imposition of large
exit fees by the CPUC.  If there is a chance that it moves, we need to
discuss the effect of this bill.  Mike Day
