Yes.  Thanks very much Maureen and Ginger.  There is a subsequent power point presentation that I'm fairly confident I distributed (may have done so after I got back from New York, so you might also want to search Steve and Rick's in-boxes through the first two weeks of February).  Thanks again for the help.

Best,
Jeff

I've still got considerable work to do, but wanted to make sure all had a chance to review and comment well in advance of finalizing.  I'm giving a talk at Exnet on Monday about California.  Attached is a draft of the slides.  All comments welcome and appreciated.  I'm continuing to work on it.  Thanks very much.

Best,
Jeff
