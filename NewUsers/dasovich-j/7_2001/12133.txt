Bizarre as it sounds, we've now heard that they are calling the Assembly 
members back.  So it appears that the Assembly leadership will at least make 
a run at this.  We are getting more information and mobilizing industry.  
Some key considerations:

The Governor is putting immense pressure on the Legislature to get something 
done.
The Legislature is fearful of getting blamed by the Governor for having "done 
nothing."
Becauase the Assembly has thus far "done nothing," the only thing it has in 
front of it is 78.
The Assembly could not agree to the Speaker's bill because it felt the bill 
was too far to the left; but 78 is even more one-sided. So there's a 
reasonable likelihood that 78 would have to be amended considerably in order 
to get the support necessary to get voted out.
Once voted out of the Assembly, it would have to go back to the Senate, where 
the Senate would have to approve it.
Again, the Senate has adjourned, so Burton would have to round them up and 
call them back for a vote, and there's no indication at this time that 
Burton's inclined to come back.
In addition, Burton has said that he's not interested in making any changes 
to 78, that "it's 78 or nothing."  Consequently, for the Sentate (i.e., 
Burton) to vote it out, it would first have to agree to the Assembly's 
amendments.  Thus far, the Assembly and the Senate have not seen eye to eye 
on the issues.
All that said, this Legislature is far from rational, and nothing can be 
counted out.  We're therefore operating under the assumption that 78 could 
move. 
Will report back as information becomes available.
Best,
Jeff

The Assembly is tentatively scheduled to take up SBX2 78 in committee on
Friday.  If the bill passes, it may go straight to the Assembly floor that
night.  The Senate may go in either late Friday or early Monday to take up
the bill as amended although this has not been confirmed.

Amendments to SBX 78 may be available tomorrow.
