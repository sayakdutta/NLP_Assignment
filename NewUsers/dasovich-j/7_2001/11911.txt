It's a hell hole, whaddya think?  Be great if you stopped by.  Just let me 
know when you're going to be here.  Love to have dinner and catch up.

You involved at all with the gas infrastructure stuff that's going on at the 
Cal PUC.  If not, I think that you should be.  Now that Fawcett has left TW 
and Susan Scott's in our shop in Houston with Christie, I'm a little 
concerned about TW (I don't have as much time to monitor anymore).  Be great 
if you got involved.

Hope all is well with you and yours.

Best,
Jeff
