Thanks Cynthia.  

Could you please try the W (since I know that one) and let me know as soon as 
possible?  Greatly appreciated.  

And I'll go ahead on the frequent flyer miles.  I'm assuming that the ticket 
you booked for me (is the one that leaves SF on 8/2 at 9:15 AM and returns 
from NYC on 8/5 at 4:15 EDT)?

Thanks again.

Best,
Jeff

Hello there. I have made reservations for Jeff. If he is wanting to use
frequent flyer mileage for the other ticket, the number to call is
800-421-4655 then press 4. I made those kind of reservations one time, and
the airline agent screwed them all up and ended up being the biggest
headache for me, so I don't touch them any more. Also, the waldorf towers
and waldorf astoria both are sold out for those days. Does he have a couple
of other choices? Enron's preferred hotels are: Drake, Hilton and Towers,
Intercontinental, Loews Metropolitan, Millennium Broadway, Millennium
Hilton, New York Palace, Penninsula, Plaza, St Regis, and W hotel. Let me
know if you want me to check any of those.

thanks
cynthia
