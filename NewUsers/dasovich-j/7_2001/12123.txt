My apologies.  I just found this note.  Very kind of you to invite me and 
I'll plan to attend.

Best,
Jeff

Hi friends (partial list),

Dave and I are planning to have a party to celebrate the upcoming
October wedding of Scott and Gayle.  The wedding will be small and in
Southern California, so our hope is that you and your partners will be
able to come to a party on September 22nd (place and festivities to be
announced) to share our joy.  We request no gifts, just your presence.
So please save the date.
