Bonnie:  Please forward to Michael Kirby.
I think the draft looks good.  Could you also prepare a draft of the letter 
we discussed yesterday to convey the proposal to the committee?











Attached is a draft Nonwaiver Agreement per our telephone conferences of 
yesterday after the meetings with Senator Dunn.  I am available in my office 
for a conference call to discuss this.
