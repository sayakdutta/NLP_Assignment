Greetings:

With California enjoying a brief respite from Legislative antics, we plan to 
cancel tomorrow's California call and will reconvene on Thursday.

However, if anyone has pressing matters or information they'd like to discuss 
tomorrow, we'll go ahead with the call.  Let me know.  

If I've missed anyone with this note, please forward along.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff
