Hi.  Me again.  Thanks for all the help with the New York trip.  I have 
another question.  My family (four people) is going to Boston on September 2, 
returning to SF on September 9.  I noticed on United's website that they have 
round trip for about $365 and I was wondering if you folks can better that?

Best,
Jeff

information on it.
