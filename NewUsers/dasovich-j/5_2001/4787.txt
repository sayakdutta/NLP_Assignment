To add to Bev's comments, I've gotten many calls from large customers today.  
I'll be meeting with them in Sacramento on Monday to discuss the core/noncore 
structure further and try to craft a core/noncore structure that makes 
sense.  I've also asked Sandi and the Sacramento team to line up meetings 
with key legislators while I'm there to discuss the same.

Business is, as was expected, very unhappy about that portion of the plan 
that would stick them with all of Edison's debts.  They view it as unfair and 
punitive (which it is) and are frustrated that the Democrats would include it 
simply to "make the deal Harvey proof."  Many questioned Keeley about why the 
Democrats are hell bent on pandering to Harvey.  Keely said that the Assembly 
is also trying to come up with something that will get support from the 
Senate (read "Burton").

Keely also mentioned our name in a list of many names as sources of 
information used to build the proposal.

Best,
Jeff

I attended the Chamber meeting today and the  discussion focused on P.R. 
efforts for large users focusing on core and non-core opposition. Bob Foster 
with Edison made a presentation regarding support of M.O.U. and Fred Keeley 
came in and described Hertzberg's Plan B which mostly emphasized direct 
access. Hertzberg's Plan B was not particularly well received by the user 
groups. More details later.
