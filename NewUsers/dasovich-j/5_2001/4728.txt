Rosalee:  Could you please print out the following two documents for Mr. 
Lay?  One is an excel sheet showing the summary of the results of our analyis 
of the core/noncore market structure that Mr. Lay has been discussing with 
leaders in California.  The other is a word document explaining the summary 
tables contents.  If you have any questions, just let me know.  Maureen, can 
you print out for Steve, too?  Thanks very much for your help.

Best,
Jeff
