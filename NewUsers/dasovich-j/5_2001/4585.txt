Thanks.  Will be very interested to hear how the meeting goes.  My sense is 
that the timing could be just about right. 
Best,
Jeff

The four leaders of both houses are meeting in the speaker's office this
afternoon to discuss ways to solve the energy crisis.  I left a meeting
with the Speaker to vacate the room for the leadership meeting, which
was described to me by the Speaker's Chief of Staff as preliminary to a
global solution, if one is achievable.  I have a scheduled meeting with
one of the leaders later today at which time I hope to get feedback on
any progress.
