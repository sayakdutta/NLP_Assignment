You guys are stars.  Thanks so much for all you did for Prentice.  I think 
she had a really, really good time and felt really neat about the whole 
thing.  She's wonderful and you guys gave her the wonderful day that she 
earned and deserved.  Thanks so much.

And, as usual, thanks for being great hosts yesterday (Nancy, you outdid 
yourself with dinner).

OK, so I am doing everything that I can to leave for the Dome Wednesday 
night.  If you guys want, we can pack up the Suburban with everything that 
needs to go up ( or at least just about everything), and we can drive it up 
and then you two can take my SAAB up.  Then, coming back, you can drive the 
Suburban and I can drive the SAAB.  What do you think?

Finally, Eldon, do you have the Blue Book at your house?  I'm looking for the 
number of someone I can get to haul away all the crap (junk from around the 
generator shed, that rotten ol' pile of wood by the driveway, the 
un-salvagable wood from the old deck, etc.).  Can you find a couple "hauler" 
numbers in there and send me the numbers?  Thanks a million.

Best,
Jeff
