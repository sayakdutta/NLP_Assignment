Hi TJ:
Work has prevented me from being on campus this week.  I registered for 
1-unit courses, but have not "signed up" in the office.  If that is 
mandatory, please let me know and my girlfriend---a student in the day 
program who will be there today---can sign me up.

Best,
Jeff

Hi,

ONE-UNIT COURSES:
The demand for one-unit courses is very high, as outlined in the Student 
Handbook.  It is uncommon for a student to be given a space in more than 
ONE one-unit course per semester.

If you got into your 1st choice of a 1-unit class for Fall 2001, you will 
not be put on a waitlist for your 2nd choice at this time.  After classes 
start in the Fall, if there is room available in any of the 1-units, we'll 
let you know.  Adds will be based on seniority in the program.

Thanks!
You'll be given a chance to update your schedules May 4 - May 11.
I will e-mail your Fall 2001 schedules to you this Friday.

Thanks!
TJ
