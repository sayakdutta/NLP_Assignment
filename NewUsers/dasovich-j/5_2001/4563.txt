As some of you may know, President Bush is scheduled to visit St. Paul 
Minnesota on Thursday to tour the city's District Energy system and to give a 
"major speech on energy policy".  District Energy is a facility which heats 
and cools 75% of the downtown buildings and is converting part of its system 
to burn renewable wood biomass.  St. Paul Mayor Norm Coleman headed George's 
presidential campaign in MN.

It is believed that Spence Abraham and Christi Nicolay will be accompanying 
him on the trip.

They are also scheduled to visit another plant in Iowa on Thursday.
