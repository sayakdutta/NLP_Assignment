Allan Zaremberg, President of the California Chamber of Commerce, met
with John Burton to discuss energy.  One of the items which John Burton
brought up to Allan was Bob Hertzberg's core/non-core proposal.
According to the Chamber, Burton is interested in the concept and wants
to get Allan's thoughts.  The Chamber is very interested in hearing more
about the proposal which they attribute to Enron and would like
documentation.  Could someone please forward the appropriate documents
to me.  I also suggested that the Chamber and Enron circle back to
discuss the item in greater detail as soon as possible.
