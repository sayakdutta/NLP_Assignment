Yes.  And she handed out last time's mid-term.  It was take home at that time, though.  It's open book; we have the whole time, but she said it should take about 90 minutes (which means that it will take me the whole time).  You want me to fax it to you?  Check the website first. It may be posted there.




Hey Jeff,

I had to miss last night's class, as you may have
noticed.  Were there any notes, handouts, sample
questions, etc for next week's exam?

Thanks,

JT
