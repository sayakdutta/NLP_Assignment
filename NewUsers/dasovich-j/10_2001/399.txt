Two things.  1) Assuming that you're lead on the meeting (i.e., agenda, facilitate meeting)---if not, just let us know and we'll take the reins.  2) Seems appropriate to invite Jim to participate.  Sure he'll be interested.  Your call.

Best,
Jeff

Joseph,

Can you work with Sue and set up a call for Wed.  afternoon.  Perhaps the same call could be our weekly meeting since Sue and Jeff are tied up on Thurs.

Oh dear.  Get a story straight?  That's moving the bar pretty darned high, ain't it?  Wednesday looks good for me.

My recollections is that Paul wanted a meeting before meeting with commercial folks to "get our story straight."  Can you set that up? Wed afternoon would work for me.

Jeff and I are still planning to thumb our noses at the terrorists and fly up there on Thursday morning.  We were planning on a 10 am to 2 pm meeting, working through lunch. Does this sound good to you two?
