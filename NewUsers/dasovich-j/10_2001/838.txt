Steve:

Been wanting to drop you a line to say, Hang in there.  You're a remarkable individual, and it's great working with you. As far as I'm concerned--and there are many with a similar view--I'm ready to do whatever it takes to help turn things around.  You can count on that.  (Now if we can just find something left to turn around.  Kidding.) If there's anything you need, please don't hesitate to let me know.  Please give my regards to Ken.

Best,
Jeff
