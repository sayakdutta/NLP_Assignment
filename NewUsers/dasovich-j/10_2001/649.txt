I like Saturday afternoon after your lesson, since we've got a wedding at 3 pm on Sunday to go to.





I have a mandolin lesson at 11am on Saturday, which I can't miss because Tom 
is teaching me less these days. That means I can be up in Napa for a 2 pm 
tee-off. Or, we can play on Sunday at 1 or so, after the first set of games? 
Or earlier, if you want. How does that sound? Let me know.
