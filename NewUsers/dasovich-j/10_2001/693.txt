Every Monday at 10:30 AM (Houston time), which is, more or less, a company-wide call.
Every Wednesday at 1:30 PM (Houston time), which is a Government Affairs-only call.

Those are it.  If there's anything else, just let me know.

Best,
Jeff

 


	I'm sure you are on your call this a.m.

	Can you reverify the time and date of your conf calls, there is some confusion on the calls.

	Thanks!!!!!
