Sue's will be in Houston for this, but will there be a call-in number to tap into for some of the discussion?  Thanks a lot.
 
Best,
Jeff

Dear All,
 
Attached to this message is the agenda outline for our meeting in Houton TX on Wednesday, October 10 beginning at 8 AM.
 
I have arranged with Linda Noske for a continental breakfast to be available so we can get started promptly at 8AM and as Christi has noted, lunch will also be provided.  Any questions, please contact me.  
 
Kind Regards,
 
Dave
