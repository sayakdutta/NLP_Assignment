Sounds good.




I suggest a "blind draw" on the teams, best ball not scramble on the golf,  and as for the wager, no emails from the losing team for one week! 




Is there any question?  I'll leave to Steve to structure the deal.  As I recall, Montavano, Shapiro and I usually make up one team, but I'm willing to switch around a bit.
 
Best,
Jeff

Are you playing golf?  And if yes, what's the game and wager???
