Guess who?  Me again.  You thought about having your guy Jack (who's likely got the most juice of anyone in the group) go to the Governor and tell him to tell Angelides to knock it off and to back off?

Second, what do you think about sending the letter directly to Angelides--after all, he's the one who's being a chowder head--and cc'ing Loretta?

Third, I should be able to get you something on our view of RTOs.

Best,
Jeff
