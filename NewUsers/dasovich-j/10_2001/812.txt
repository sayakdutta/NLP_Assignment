Jeff: Thanks again for joining for the conference. I was actually very busy with folks there through the breakfast meeting Saturday am (had one particularly hostile attendee to that) and then on through Saturday afternoon- questions, questions, questions so I would say our attendance was definitely worthwhile. Your insight and provacative discussion provided an excellent framework for the business case we were trying to communicate. If I can ever be of any assistance to you, please feel free to call me. When I meet folks like you, it just reinforces my commitment to the great people we work with and the great company we work for. Thanks, Laurie
