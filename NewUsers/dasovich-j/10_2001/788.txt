Sorry about that.  I'll get back to you with some other dates.

 

The 15th is Enron's Management Conference and the 22nd is Thanksgiving.  Any other dates?

 

Hi Brad:
I finally got in touch with the people from Perfect.  They'll be in Houston on the 15th and the 22nd of November.  Either of those days work for you?  If so, any time preference?

Best,
Jeff
