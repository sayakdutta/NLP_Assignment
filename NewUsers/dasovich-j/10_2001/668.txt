Great.  Tom will get back to me to confirm that 11 AM works for him.  I'll let you know.

Best,
Jeff

 

Works for me...

 

My consultant buddy, Tom Beach is the technical consultant for Jerry Bloom's organization, the California Cogeneration Coalition (or something like that).  About 1000 MW of cogen throughout the state.  I've tentatively set up a meeting with him for Wednesday at 11 AM.  So we can do Alcantar at 9, and Tom at 11.  That work?

Best,
Jeff
