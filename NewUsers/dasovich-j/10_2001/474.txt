Great.  Figured they'd contacted them, but wanted to make sure.  You know when the meeting with schedulers will be?  I apologize, I'm on the road and haven't heard when that will be.  I'm thinking that I may want to attend.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

 

Thanks for the info - a few people from our shop will be in attendance./

 

If you haven't heard, SoCal's announced their abandoning windows for OFOs.  They're holding "workshops" on how it will all work soon.  I'll get you the announcement.

Best,
Jeff
