How do the 13th or 20th of November work?

 

The 15th is Enron's Management Conference and the 22nd is Thanksgiving.  Any other dates?

 

Hi Brad:
I finally got in touch with the people from Perfect.  They'll be in Houston on the 15th and the 22nd of November.  Either of those days work for you?  If so, any time preference?

Best,
Jeff
