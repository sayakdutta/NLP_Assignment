Hi Doug:
Hope all is well.  Congratulations to you folks on your agreement with the PUC.  Must be a relief. 

 I was writing to get your reaction to the judge's proposed order in the El Paso case.  You think the Commission is likely to adopt it?  Change it?  Judge's proposal fatally flawed on the market power issue?  Appreciate your insights.

AND did you hear Bilas issued the our gas settlement as his proposed decision for adoption by the Commission at its 10.25.01 meeting!?!?!  What next?

Best,
Jeff
