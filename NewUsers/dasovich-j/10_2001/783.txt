The State Board of Equalization (SBE) earlier today voted 3-1 to adopt a re=
vised Rule 905, to go to state assessment of power plants.  They adopted th=
e staff recommendation, but changed the effective date to January 1, 2003. =
 This is being done in an effort to "push the Legislature to act on AB 81 (=
Migden)."  The motion was made by Controller Connell and SBE Members Chiang=
 and Klehs voted in support.  Parrish abstained, while Andal voted no.
