Sounds like a good outcome.  Thanks.

Best,

I spoke with Ken Smith about his work with Enron.  His monthly retainer ends the end of October, and he has agreed (very happily) to be available as needed going forward on an hourly basis ($160/hour).  To make it easiest, we have agreed that he can do up to five hours of work a month without any prior authorization from me -- this should make it as easy as possible for the entire team to be able to use him as needed.  If a project arises that will consume more time, he will contact me.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!
