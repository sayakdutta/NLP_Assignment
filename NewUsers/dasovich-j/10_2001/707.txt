FYI.  Please keep confidential and do not circulate.  This is just the first draft of a letter we're working with the large customers on in response the Angelides tantrum.  Only the large customers will sign, however.  I'll forward the final when they've completed it	.  Sue's working on ARM to do something akin from the suppliers side.

Best,
Jeff

Wanna sign onto this letter to Loretta? Any suggestions? We could make it a CEA thing.

(I am copying Jeff D. as a courtesy...I think we need this to be just a customer deal).
