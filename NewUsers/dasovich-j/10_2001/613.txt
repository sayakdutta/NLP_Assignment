check's in the mail.  i made it an even $150.  Let me know if that works. Scala's the Eye-talian place that's kitty-korner from Willow, right?  Coming soon, this hip chef (and part owner of the Willow) is opening up a competing place right across the street from Willow.  Should be interesting.  We gotta dive again before the season's out. (If I can find the freakin' licenses.  I'll start looking in earnest.)

Yeah, we gotta finish the job.  You take out the WTC, you gotta pay.

Best,
Jeff




It was a great weekend. Mellow and raging at the same time. Thanks for 
coming. I'm glad you had a good time with everyone as well, including people 
you hadn't hung out with before. The abalone diving was great, even if I 
can't seem to get one now.

It was $100 for each couple for everything. But you got a lot of people onto 
the reef, so if you want to take that off the bill, that's fine, too.

I guess I'll see you tonight? The chefs are going to cook something up. By 
the way, we stopped in Graton yesterday and went to Scala (because Willow 
was closed, to my utter dismay). But Scala was damn good. We had the Dutton 
Pinot, which was great. I had a homemade ravioli that really hit the spot.

See you later,

Scott

P.S. I agree with everything that guy said in the article you sent out. 
Pacifism is just not feasible in most situations. The world can be too 
selfish and evil for something so extreme to be effective more than 15% of 
the time. We have to go after those motherfuckers. And then be very 
responsible in the aftermath.
