This will work for what I need to submit.  FYI:  I'm not going to get another person to help out on this, so I'm assuming that with me and the resources that I'll bring to bear, and with you folks and the resources that you'll devote, we'll be able to do an outstanding job of achieving the overall objective of taking a proactive regulatory stance in California.

Best,
Jeff

Based upon the discussion in our last meeting, we would suggest the need for increased coverage of the following areas:

1. PG&E's Gas Accord 
2. PG&E's attempt to switch backbone jurisdiciton to FERC through the bankruptcy proceeding
3. Movement in Socal's GIR or other plans to open its backbone to firm transport
4. Socal's RLS tariff and requests to reduce the cost allocation to that service.
5. Socal WACOG filings, calculations
6. Tariff changes that provide for backhaul service from SDG&E/North Baja to Socal territory

Jeff - this is just a cursory list. Our real need is to have information that comes from a proactive stance in the regulatory processes.  

Please call  Barry or myself if you have any questions.

Regards,

Stephanie
