I don't believe these are what I am looking for.  The Decision references Exhibits 14, 18, and 38 most frequently, but also Exhibits 9 and 26.  I do not see those titles or labels on any of these documents, and the descriptions of their contents in the Decision indicate to me that these aren't the Exhibits.
