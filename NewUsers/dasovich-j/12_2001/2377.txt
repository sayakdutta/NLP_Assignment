Thanks very much?  Does that mean that the Hansen contract would be sold as a stand-alone asset?

 

             They are included in the CAL book but not in the 24 as they were added after the count was 24.   as of 12 noon, we were still waiting data from ENA but had the contract and had included in the iniitail due diligence.

 

Please forgive me for continuing with this, but ENA just told me that they talked to Jeremy about 90 minutes ago and they had the view that there was still some uncertainty regarding whether Hansen had been included in the 24 contracts.  I told them that I'd already spoken with you folks and that Hansen was on the list.  Let me know if I'm missing something here.  Again, apologize for keeping on about it.

Best,
Jeff
