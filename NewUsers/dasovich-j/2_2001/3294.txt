Please turn comments around as quickly as possible.  The folks in Sacramento 
need them by 1 PM CST.  Thanks very much.

Best,

As discussed, attached please find draft opposition letters to SBX 33
and SBX 6 for the Senate floor.  Mike Day originally drafted longer
versions of these letters for the committee hearings.  We tried to
shorten both letters to make them easier to understand for the general
membership.

Please advise as soon as possible.
