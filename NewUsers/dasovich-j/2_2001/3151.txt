Jeff - 

Just to circle back with you with regard to the question whether EES can 
continue to enroll customers (raised in yesterday's SDGE meeting).  While 
still somewhat vague, it is the opinion of Legal that EES may continue to 
enroll new customers until there is commission action making effective that 
section of ABX1 suspending direct access.  One issue requiring further legal 
review is whether the commission can retroactively suspend direct access to 
the effective date of ABX1.  This was communicated to the EES folks in a 
subsequent meeting yesterday.
