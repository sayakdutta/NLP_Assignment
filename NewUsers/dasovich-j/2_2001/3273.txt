The Republican Caucus briefing Thursday was well attended, and members were
appreciative of the fact that Jan and other members of IEP took the time to
brief them.  The feedback we've heard from Republican Leader Bill Campbell's
office and others is that the handouts IEP provided were great, and the
presentations very informative.  In fact, several members acknowledged that
they had never heard the message communicated in such a clear, concise way.

Just fyi, one issue that is on the radar screen of Republicans is the fact
that generators have not been paid -- yet they still continue to supply
electricity to California.

We have offered to brief the Democrat Caucus, but they have not expressed
interest thus far.  We will continue trying!

Below is a list of those who attended the meeting.

Thanks,
Jean
