I'm scheduled to meet with Kari at 3:30 PST tomorrow, ostensibly to talk 
about demand buy-down.  Also presume to message the letter from Steve Kean to 
the Senators and our solution (perhaps in advance of meetings, phone calls 
that might take place later in the week with legislative leaders).  But would 
like to add to agenda for discussion on tomorrow's daily call in the event 
folks have additional suggestions.

Best,
Jeff
