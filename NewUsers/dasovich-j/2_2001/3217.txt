The Senate Energy Committee met yesterday afternoon and passed two very
important bills.

SB 6x (Burton/Bowen), as amended, would establish a state power and
financing authority. The measure passed on a party-line vote with no
Republican votes.  What makes SB 6x interesting to IEP members is that is
provides financing through the Authority for environmental improvements to
existing powerplants 30 years or older.  IEP testified in support of the
bill if it was amended to bind Authority=01,s eminent domain powers.  Senat=
or
Burton agreed and IEP is currently drafting language on this issue.
Similarly, Burton agreed to work with Senator Morrow on language that would
limit the Authority to only supplementing private power generation and not
building power plants where they are not needed.   The amended version is
attached.

SB 33x, as amended, would authorize the Governor to enter into negotiations
with the IOUs to purchase their transmission system.  The Governor=01,s pla=
n
would have to be approved by the Legislature by only a majority vote.  If
approved the Treasurer would have the authority to issue revenue bonds to
pay for the transmission system.  This measure also passed on a party-line
vote.  IEP submitted written opposition to the bill as introduced, but will
continue to voice its concern with the state being both a market participan=
t
and owning the transmission system as the bill moves through the legislativ=
e
process.  The amended version is not in print yet.
