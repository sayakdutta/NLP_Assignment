har-dee-har-har.  I mean, will we be celebrating in some fashion.  I'm 
scheduled to go to Houston--I'm not kidding--but if there's something 
planned, which I assume there is, then I'm going to cancel my trip to 
Houston, like pronto.

Ironically,
Jeff

cooking! 
 


You are so sweet.  Thanks so much.  What's new?  What are we doing on the 
Friday of Eldon's b-day?

Finally - here is the name of the contact 

  

Nancy, sorry this took a while, but it will be worth it.  If anybody knows 
about the Sonoma Coast, it's this guy.  He's done work with Flowers, 
Kistler, etc. out there.  His name is Greg Bjornstad (sp.?) and his number 
is (707) 829-1687.  He doesn't really know me from a hole in the ground but 
you can "double reference" my name as Todd Graff's friend.  Todd is the 
winemaker at Sonoma Creek and is a good friend of mine who worked with Eric 
on some projects.
