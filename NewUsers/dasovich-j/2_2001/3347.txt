We are in the process of distilling this list down to its essentials, and 
when we are done, I will forward it along to the group.  So as not to hold 
you up, I am attaching a comprehensive list of proposed legislation in both 
the Assembly and the Senate in California, along with short summary of what 
each piece of legislation purports to do.

Thanks-

John
