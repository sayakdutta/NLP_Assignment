RE: Upcoming Legislative Issues

The Senate Energy Committee is having a hearing on Tuesday afternoon. They
will be hearing testimony on SB 6x (Burton), which would establish a state
power authority; and SB 33x (Burton), which would create the California
Transmission Authority.  Attached is a memo from Andy Brown on SB 6x, and I
requested something similar from him on SB 33x.  IEP needs to decide what
position, if any, it is going to take on these measures.

Also, since last Friday's siting meeting ended-up focusing primarily on SB
28x (Sher) and AB (Wright), participants never had the opportunity to
comment on and develop a comprehensive plan for siting issues. IEP has its
list of 8 issues (attached) that member developers would like to see in
legislation, but this list is incomplete.  As siting bills are introduced
and heard, IEP should be able to stand before committees with this template
of a perfect siting bill that encourages continued development of
electricity supply in California.

IEP may want to consider scheduling a conference call Monday afternoon to
discuss these issues with members.
