Commissioner Lynch and ALJ Cooke have each issued proposed decisions which  
adopt differing guidelines for bilateral power purchase contracts entered 
into  by the utilities.? 
?
If the utilities follow these guidelines, the Commission will forego  
reasonableness reviews of the contracts.? Attached is a  memorandum?which 
summarizes the filings made by interested parties  and?highlights the major 
elements of the two draft decisions.
?
This matter will be voted on at the February 8 Commission meeting.
