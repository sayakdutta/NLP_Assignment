Dennis, Eric,

Jeff Dasovich will be sending you language currently being contemplated by 
the CPUC regarding customers switching from Bundled Utility status to Direct 
Access status.  We need to begin estimating the price tag for what that 
switch back may be in regards to UC/CSU.  Please take a look at the current 
contemplated language and assess if we are able to translate that into a 
cost, recognizing we are in a very fluid environment.  We need an assessment 
by tomorrow (assuming, of course, that the existing language provides us 
enough guidance to make such an assessment).

Thank you - Tom
