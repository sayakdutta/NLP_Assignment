Karen:  Harry's done some more recent work on the numbers we need to fill in, 
so he'll fill them in.  Harry:  the numbers we've thrown around over the last 
couple of months are:

From 1996 to 1999, peak demand increased by 5,522 megawatts, but only 672 
megawatts of new capacity was added.  Meanwhile, electricity is growing over 
5% per year.

Jeff -- Attached is the draft op-ed for the SF Chronicle.  Ken Lay has made 
some revisions, and it's ready to go, but I need you to fill in the blanks.  
Dave Parquet has signed off on the peaker info.  I need to do a quick 
turnaround, so as soon as you can get it to me, I can get it to Ken for final 
approval.

Thanks!
