On the 21st, Tauzin and Barton are holding separate meetings with executives 
from the respective stakeholder groups in Southern California to have "frank" 
discussions about California.  Steve Kean will attend for Enron.  At Steve's 
meetings will be other gas and electric marketers, and generators.  Linda 
Robertson would like to talk with us tomorrow about getting Steve prep-ed for 
the meeting.  She'd like to have the call at 3 PM California time.  Her 
assistant will be sending details very soon.

Best,
Jeff
