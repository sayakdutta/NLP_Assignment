Hello, and thank you for taking time to answer my question.

Your company was recently awarded $1,650,000 from a project called AB 970
(Demand Responsiveness Program) from the California Energy Commission. I
have read the simple paragraph of the overall concept of the program.
But,can you please provide me specifics on what you plan to do with that
money?

I am also looking for information that you can provide concerning if you
will be working with a company named Conectisys Corp with regards to this
program and two way communications devices or advanced metering devices.

Thank you for you time with this matter.

Sincerely,

Michael Kavanaugh
