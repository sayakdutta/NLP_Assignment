Dad is picking up 2 cases of champagne for each of you tomorrow.  Please send 
me a check for $129.00 each. 
Jeff, if you guys are coming to Napa this weekend it is fine to bring the 
check along with the one for the zin ($146.29) for a total of $275.29.  We 
won't be home on Friday night but your wine will be at the house (probably 
still in the truck).:
2 cases Coastal Zin 
2 cases Domaine Magnums. 
Will you be back on Monday??  Could pick it all up then if you 
want...Cameron's too??
