Hey, how's things? Long time not chat.  What's up?  Anywho, you seem like the 
right person to respond to this email.  (And I have no idea.)

Best,
Jeff

Jeff,
I'd meant to stop in your office today to ask you about this in person, but 
you seemed rather busy whenever I went by.  Now I'll be out for awhile so am 
sending you this note instead.

I got a call from KKSF who is putting on an Earth Day Jazz concert at the 
Chronicle (Concord) Pavillion on 4/29 asking if we are interested in 
sponsoring the vent, expected to draw 20,000 Northern Calif consumers with a 
high income/education demographic.  In addition to signage, display 
opportunities, etc. there is the opportunity for a feature story on CNET 
Radio for promotion of companies' involvement in the community (energy 
efficiency, quality of life whatever).
Previous sponsors of interst are PG&E, Green Mountain, and the Renewable 
Energy Marketing Board.

My question for you is whether Enron would be interested in the opportunity 
for positive PR here in CA, or whether we are trying to keep a low profile.  
Is an opportunity like this something any part of Enron (EES included) would 
be interested in?

Thanks for advising.
Catherine
