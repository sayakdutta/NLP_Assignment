Thanks, Cynthia.  Extreme rhetoric likely from Ms Lynch, CPUC Prez, UCAN and 
Sempra chief (Steve Baum).  Rest of panel looking pretty good.  Might be 
useful to let Smutney do at least the lion's share of the "responding" to Ms 
Lynch's and Mr. Baum's rabid attacks on generators.  Smutney's had a lot of 
practice in the last couple of months and he's close to the issue.  But, of 
course, a few well placed jabs, couldn't hurt....
