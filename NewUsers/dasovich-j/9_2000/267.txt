John and Kittina Powers (among others) are coming to dinner Oct 7.  Please
let me know by the time we get back (9/23) from Mexico if any or all of you
care to join us.  It is not a command performance, but you are most
welcome.  I need to know to order the foie gras - there is a shortage of it
right now - probably due to our anniversary approaching
