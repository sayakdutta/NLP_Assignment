As you know, I have great interest.  However, I've checked flight schedules 
to come out Tuesday night, and to put it mildly, it's very ugly.  Seems like 
alot to arrive in D.C. around 3 AM only to turn around and head back to the 
left coast the next day at 3-4 PM.  But I think the meeting should go ahead 
and take place anyway.  Is there any chance that Lisa could get a phone in 
your meeting room so that I could participate by conference call?  Sorry for 
the headache.  Let me know.  Thanks again for the chat this PM.

Best,
Jeff

By this e-mail I'm requesting that we all meet on Wednesday, September 13, 
2000, for breakfast to discuss the California/FERC wholesale issues that have 
been plaguing us and will plague us over the next year or so.   I suggest 
that the meeting be limited to:  (1) an identification of the inventory of 
forums we are facing; and (2) our allocation of resources to the inventory.  
If time permits, we can also have a substantive discussion of the issues.  In 
this regard, if its ready, we can present an overview of the California 
strategy that is being developed (initially) by Sandi and Jeff.   

Respond ASAP directly to Lysa Akin with your interest in participating in 
this meeting.

Lysa:  once we have a head count, please get us a meeting room and 
breakfast.  We'll need an easel with paper and markers.
