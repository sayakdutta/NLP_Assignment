Thanks.  The hearings were tiresome, but hanging out with you and Steve was a 
real treat.  Hope to do it again soon.  You probably noticed that, in my 
summary, I made no mention of the shoes that I was wearing.....

Best,
Jeff

Now I know why you were scribbling in that little blue book!  Great notes!  
Sounds like Tuesday was quite a circus -- and a long, drawn-out one, too.  I 
think you did great and wish Steve and I could have stayed for Tuesday's 
performance.  Thanks for all the updates.  kd
