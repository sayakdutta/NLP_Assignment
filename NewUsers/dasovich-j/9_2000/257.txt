Jim is available at 10:00 pacific time.  Does that work for others?  Jim - 
Ron suggests having Carl Imparato on the call because of his extensive 
knowledge of California markets.  What do you think? If you were looking for 
an attached list, I haven't prepared it yet.

9am Central time is bad for me.  I could do it at 8am Central or 12noon 
Central.  Don't hold off for me.

I'd like to have a conference call tommorrow at 9:00 a.m. to review Tim's 
"top 5" priorities to fix the wholesale market in California.  I need to do 
this tomorrow so Seabron and Ron can write our pleading for the Section 206 
proceeding while I'm on vacation next week.  Please let me know ASAP if 9:00 
is a bad time or if you don't want to be on the call.
