would seem useful if we all contribute in some manner, but i'm open to 
suggestions.  perhaps we could divvy up the questions.









Hello,

I have started to look at the case assignment for Monday.  Since, I will be
out of town the following week I will volunteer to write this one up.  I
don't know how he want to divvy up the work (by Questions or everyone does
it all), but let me know.  I have already made a spreadsheet with the
combined cash flow statement that I will send to you tomorrow.  Let me know
how we want to handle this.
