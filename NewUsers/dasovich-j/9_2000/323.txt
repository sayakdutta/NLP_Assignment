OK, the powers that be have phoned.  I am to be there tomorrow and Wed.  
Tomorrow I'm huddle at the Woodlands all day.  But Wednesday I'll be in the 
office.  Perhaps coffee or lunch?  Could you forward to the lovely Ms Scott, 
since every time I type her name in, I get someone from ECT.  Can't wait to 
hear more about Herr Cherr-y.

Best,
Jeff
