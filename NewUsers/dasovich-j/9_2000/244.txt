Not a problem, Jimmie.  About this week's case.  Been travelling.  I'm back.  
Kim:  in your absence on Monday, we talked a little about how to proceed on 
the next case.  How's this sound:  everyone takes a question.  If the answer 
to one question depends on the answer to another, the folks doing those 
questions should get together and discuss.  Everyone should distribute to the 
team a draft of the answer to the question by tomorrow (Thursday) night.   
Then folks could look at the responses, make suggestions, comments, etc. and 
distribute via email by Noon on Saturday.  I'll then compile in a form that 
we can submit on Monday.  Thoughts?  

I have randomly selected questions:  here are the results.  Jeff--#3; 
Jimmie--#1; Kim--#2; Dylan--#4.  If folks are comfortable with this 
distribution, let me know.  

Best,
Jeff








Team
My Haas e-mail is forwarded to my work e-mail.  Last week I was on vacation
and did not see any of these e-mails.  I worked all 4 questions in what
turned out to be a parallel path (I will say your compiled answers were a
lot better than mine).  Anyway, please add my home e-mail address

address.  This will give me access to the data regardless of where I'm at.
This is particularly important on weekends.  Sorry I let you down on the
first case.
Jimmy
