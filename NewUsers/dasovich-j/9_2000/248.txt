Forgive the length, but it was a long couple of days.  Apologies in advance, 
since I'm sure I've missed something.  Hopefully, it hits the highlights and 
gives a good flavor.  Please foreward to anyone I've inadvertently missed.  
Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

Best,
Jeff
