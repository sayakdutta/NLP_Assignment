Thanks, Sue.  Agreed.  

Also, I met today with Bowen & Co. re: interconnection.  We have some 
decisions to make on that front, too, which will also require a bit of 
discussion.  

Tracy, I'm sure that Scott's in Istanbul and Donald's in Marrakesh.  Could 
you try to track those two broadband cowboys down and see if we can set up a 
conference call for next Wedneday (hopefully, that's ample lead time)?  

Finally, the draft final tariff (in strike-out-underline form) will be ready 
for review by COB Friday.  I'll email it around.  Hope all is well with all.

Best,
Jeff




Hi Jeff,

Here are my votes:

If we have the documents in hand, great.  
If we don't have them in hand, asking Bowen to produce samples probably would 
do quite a bit to speed the process.   I assume he probably has a good idea 
of what they should look like.
A short call to be sure we're all on the same page is a good idea.

Best regards,

Sue

Greetings:

As part of our final tariff filing, we need to submit "sample" forms for 
things like a Disconnect Notice, Sample Bill and New Service Orders.? Do we 
have any?  Have we had to file any elsewhere?  If not, do we want Bowen & Co. 
to "create" some for us to review, or do we prefer to find the right folks 
internal to EBS and create them internally?  Make sense to arrange a 15-30 
minute call to discuss how to execute?  All opinions, views, etc. are 
encouraged and welcome.

Best,
Jeff
