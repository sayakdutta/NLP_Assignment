Who are John and Kittina?  Who are the others you've invited?  What's the 
occasion?  When's your anniversary?  Why is there a foie gras shortage?











John and Kittina Powers (among others) are coming to dinner Oct 7.? Please 
let me know by the time we get back (9/23) from Mexico if any or all of you 
care to join us.? It is not a command performance, but you are most welcome.? 
I need to know to order the foie gras - there is a shortage of it right now - 
probably due to our anniversary approaching
