Jeff - Just wanted to follow-up on my voice mail of Friday re: Kevin Binger 
at the House Government Reform Committee.  He is looking to talk with someone 
from Enron about the California situation prior to a hearing the Committee is 
having this Thursday morning.  His phone number is 202-225-5074.  Thanks.
