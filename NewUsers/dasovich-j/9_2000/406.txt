Dear Cameron
The dates you requested are open.
As you have  recognized from our website,  we have a lush, lovely, peaceful
garden oasis in an authentic historical pueblo that is also gaining interest
as  home to many artists and  others interested in living in a most unique
environment.  Our aim is to provide a memorable experience with modern
facilities that also reflect the beauty and comfort of Mexican rustic
design.  Our casitas have kitchens, baths and covered patios that afford
privacy and a renewing atmosphere.  Great care has been taken to provide
service and comfort.
Our prime season is approaching so it is well advised to book early. We have
a number of inquiries for the dates you requested.
The rates as described are $80 USD per night for the casita .which is
separate and very private. The weekly rate is $450 USD.  To hold a
reservation we require a 50% deposit when you have your exact dates. Let us
know what they are and I will mail instructions. 
If this is your first time to this area or if there are any questions you
might have, please fell free to write. and I will do my best to answer. Our
community site for up to date events is www.todossantos.cc
Mil gracias for your inquiry.  Linda Macfarlane for Las Palmas Casitas
