Hi Gavin:

Could you do me a favor (know you're busy).  Someone told me that there's an 
article in last Thursday's? NYT blaming the California fiasco on former 
California Commissioner Dan Fessler, who was responsible (a few years back) 
for putting in place the structure we have here.  Have you seen it?  If so 
could you forward?  If not, could you try and find it and forward.  Very much 
appreciated.

Best,
Jeff
