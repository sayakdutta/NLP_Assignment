Thanks.

FYI.  The Negative PX Credit language in the MOU reads (on p.31):

"the CPUC Implementing Decisions shall include

Orders resolving the responsibility of SCE to provide credits to direct 
access customers in respect of electricity deliveries after December 31, 2000 
in respects which do not result in any material financial detriment to SCE; "

Could go several different ways, but arguably could be read to say that SCE 
will make good on credits up to 12.31.2000.  If that were the case, I'm 
assuming that about 75-90% of our exposure would be covered?

Best,
Jeff
