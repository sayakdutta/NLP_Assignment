where've we been?  where've you been?  really only stay at my house on school 
nites (monday/thursday). will be chez toi tonite.  would LOVE to go back this 
weekend (it's gorgeous---TONS of iris, apple blossoms, wild flowers, etc.), 
but alas, we promised you're folks we'd plant tomatoes this weekend.  I'm 
going to put down nice gravely rock around the beds, so it looks more like 
Italy, or France or something and we don't get all the weeds.  Sorry about 
S.D., but it will be super nice down there.  Be sure to go to Black's Beach.  
And golf and Torrey Pines.  See you tonite?

Where have you been - I haven't seen you guys at all.  Staying at your house
a little more these days??  When are you going back up to the dome?  We are
leaving Friday for San Diego to spend the easter holiday (yeah, whatever)
with Scotty's mom.
