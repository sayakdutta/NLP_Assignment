IEP KEY MESSAGES

Generators have been operating under the rules California established for i=

electricity market.  We did not create the market, nor did we write the=20
rules.  In fact, the "big five" generators did not come to California until=
=20
AB 1890 invited them into the state, where they?ve since invested billions =
of=20
dollars buying, building and modernizing power plants.

=01. Energy companies, independent financial analysts and IEP warned that t=
he=20
PUC was failing to implement AB 1890 properly, and that the market was bein=
g=20
set up to fail, especially the residential market.
=01. Last summer, generators were urging and offering long-term contacts. T=

were flatly rejected.  Had they been adopted, the crisis could have been=20
prevented or its severity dramatically lessened.
=01. This crisis was caused by three things =01. the failure to enter into=

long-term contracts, forcing an over-reliance on the spot market; a supply=

shortage, and no retail market.  The market can be fixed.  It should not be=

abandoned.

We?re an important part of the solution.

=01. We?ve made extraordinary efforts to keep our plants running during thi=

crisis to supply California homes and businesses with electricity.

quality and generate power more efficiently.

We?re hopeful that these hearing focus on facts, fairness and accountabilit=

problem or end the crisis.
