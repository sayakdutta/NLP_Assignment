I don't know about the roommate info, but I do know that they go back a very 
long way.  Then Gov. Jerry Brown (now Mayor of Oakland) appointed Bryson to 
be the President of the California PUC.  Way before out time---I think that 
it was in the early '80s.  At the same time, Davis was Brown's chief of 
staff---so their relationship goes way back.

Best,
Jeff
