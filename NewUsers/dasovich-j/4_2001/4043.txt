computer lab for modeling.  same thing this thursday.

Here's some stuff I worked on over the weekend.  OAT's balance sheet and 
income statement and common-sized.  Haven't put together the cash flow yet.  
Please take a look.  Really wanted to get something in a file for folks to 
start looking at so that, together with the materials Anil and Carolyn have 
pulled together, we can start filling in our assumptions and doing some 
valuations.  I can do the same for Coke and Pepsi.  

Take a peek and let's try to discuss by email.  Or I'm up for a conference 
call tomorrow or Wednesday (or a meeting in person) if you folks are game.

Best,
Jeff

Now that my competition is done, I can focus on our project.
