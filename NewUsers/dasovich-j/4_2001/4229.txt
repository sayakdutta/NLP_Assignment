FYI:  Here's monthly share price date over last five years for:  OAT, KO, 
PEP, S&P, BRKA, BRKB.  (I included Berkshire in the event we want to say 
something about Buffet's recent performance.  I've attached another file with 
a chart that shows Buffet versus S&P for 1, 3 and 5 year performance)  

For the OAT, KO, PEP, etc. file, calculated year-on-year performance 
(excluding dividends).  Also, you'll see highlighted in yellow month-on-month 
performance for 2001.  But ain't done any chart for that stuff yet.  Thought 
we'd discuss first.

Best,
Jeff
