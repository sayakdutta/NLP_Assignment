Jennifer.  I apologize.  I have to turn to assignment that Steve Kean just 
gave me.  I made it almost all the way through the document.  You did a 
fantastic job under the circumstances and given the time constraints.  If I 
can get Steve's assignment finished quickly, I will turn my attention back to 
this.  Hope it helps.

Best,
Jeff
