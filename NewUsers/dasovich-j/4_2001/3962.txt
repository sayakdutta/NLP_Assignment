where are the charges? and please divide it all equally.  it was a great time 
and there's just no reason for you guys to absorb the other costs, 
particularly when the rest of us have the means to help out.

thanks again for a great time (despite the spades!).

Below are the El Cid charges for you guys.  Since we forced you to come to
Mazatlan against your will, there are no charges for anything else!  I hope
you all had a good time - I sure did!
