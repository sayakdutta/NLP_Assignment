Hi Jason:

Per my voice mail, here's the package of materials for customers to use to 
make sure key policy makers know that maintaining customer choice in 
California is critical.  As I mentioned in the voice mail, the Legislature's 
likely to move this week on a variety of fronts, so it's important that the 
business community make its voice heard immediately and clearly.  If you 
could forward this along to the SVMG members, it would be very helpful to the 
fight for cusomer choice and greatly appreciated.  Information on how to 
contact the key legislators is included.  Also included are "form" letters 
that folks can print out, sign, and send.  If you have any questions, don't 
hesitate to give me a call at 415.782.7822.

Best,
Jeff
