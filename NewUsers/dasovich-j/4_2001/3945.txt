That's so weird.  Prentice left her car door ajar (when she went to go to 
school yesterday morning, it was dead and she had to get a jump).  

I was surprised that the phone was only 300 pesos.  I thought they'd charge 
by the minute, but apparently, it's a flat 10 pesos for local (i.e., 800 
calls), no matter how long one's one.

I left the car light on - battery totally dead!  Freezing cold in SF - no
coats - landed at 9 pm - home at 12:30 am.  ugh!!!  300 pesos is just the El
Cid part of the bill - I think the rest will be on your card.  Eldon
actually got them to adjust some of that off as well cuz he said your
connection kept going off.   I say "If only life always gave us credits when
our connections went off!"





we got back ok.  (i didn't know tulsa had such a neat airport.)

you don't want to know





The entire phone bill is 300 pesos???  Yes, please fax to me.  And please
email me rest of expenses when you get a chance so I can write you a check
for everything (plane,phone, golf, etc., etc.)

You guys get back OK?
