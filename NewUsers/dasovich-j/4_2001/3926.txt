My understanding (as of yesterday evening) is that it's on its own.  I'll 
check and get back to you.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff---
I am confused.
I thought the SDG&E rate freeze was now wrapped up with 3 other pieces of 
legislation in ABX 8?
Now, I see it below....still as the Alpert bill....SBX 43.

Please give me the low-down.
Thank you.
