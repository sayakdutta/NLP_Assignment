Dinner would be great.  Best place to stay--given where you need to be---but 
sometimes a bit difficult to get in to, is the Park Hyatt.   If full, try the 
Griffin (or Griffith) Hotel (or might be the Hotel Griffin(th)).  Let me know 
if you have problems and I'll throw some more names your way.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff:

Looks like I am going to be spending some time in California.   I will be in 
Monday for the first formal unsecured creditor's committee (we were 
chosen).    Couple questions:


1. I am flying out on Tuesday morning, do you both have dinner plans?
2. Recommend where to stay (meeting at 50 Fremont at Pillsbury)?
