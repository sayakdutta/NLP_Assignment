Glad to be of help.  Glad to hear it went well.  Someone sent me some press 
on the hearing that looked great.

thanks for your help in preparing for the Texas hearing.  I think Texas 
legislators are viewing the California experience in the proper context and I 
think I was at least marginally articulate on the emissions issues as well.

thanks again.
