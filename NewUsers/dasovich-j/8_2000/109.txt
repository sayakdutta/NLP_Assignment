Byron,

Attached are the comments of the WPTF regarding the ISO's congestion
management reform proposal.  We endorse the proposal developed by the
California PX on this matter, and in our response so note from time to
time a reference to their document.

Thank you for the opportunity to provide our input.  The format for
response was well thought out, and although it took some effort to
compete the form, it will provide an invaluable guide to compare
responses made by different parties.
