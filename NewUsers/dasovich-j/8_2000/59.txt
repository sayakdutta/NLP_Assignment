We talked about this in detail with Steve when he was in Houston. Please 
check with him.  The idea is that there would be the flexibility necessary to 
do just about anything.  Also, there are problems with the decision that 
Steve was going to talk with Pulsifer about.  Need to get status of those 
conversations.My understanding was that, if there's a problem with the 
decision, perhaps our filing would be pushed a bit past the Tuesday.  We'll 
need to find that out, too.







J:

Are there additional service offerings (DWDM, etc.) that Enron wants to
offer in California (Steve indicated you guys talked about that) - and if
so, is there a narrative or did Steve get any specific info - for filing
with CPUC per final Decision?

We have to file updated tariffs next Tuesday - and want to include the
latest company service offerings.
