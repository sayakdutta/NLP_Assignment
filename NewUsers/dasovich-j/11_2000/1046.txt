I'm oozing with free time.  Monday sounds great.  Thanks.

Unless you guys will have a lot of free time this weekend, I propose we
divvy on Monday at the break.

Thanks for hosting, Kim.  Jackie mentioned the list of tasks that remain to
get this done (e.g., graphs, make spreadsheet pretty, write-up, etc.).
I'lll do whatever needs to be done, so once folks have picked which task
they'd like to take on, just let me know what's left.  Or if there's
another way folks would like to divvy up the chores, that's great, too.
Have a great weekend.  See you Monday.

Jackie, could you email the latest version around when you get a chance?
Thanks.

Best,
Jeff
