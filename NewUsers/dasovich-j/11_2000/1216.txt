Evening MBA Students,

If you signed up for a ticket to the Larry Summers Speech on December 6, 
2000, your ticket is in the Evening MBA Program Office waiting for you to 
pick it up.

Please pick-up your ticket by Monday, December 4.  We have a number of 
students on a waiting list for this event to whom we will begin to 
disseminate any unclaimed tickets.

Thank you,
Meg
