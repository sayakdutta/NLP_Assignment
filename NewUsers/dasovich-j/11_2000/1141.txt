That's great Riddles will be there.  Bobby said he would try to be there
late Friday night (after Davis), but that was it.  

WE ARE GETTING HER THE BANJO SHE HAS ALWAYS DREAMED OF (Earl Scruggs Gibson
banjo with maple neck).  DO NOT GET ANYTHING ELSE EITHER OF YOU THE BANJO IS
VERY EXPENSIVE (around 2K) AND IT WILL BE FROM ALL OF US AND IT WILL BE BOTH
HER BIRTHDAY AND XMAS.  Mom already said she will put in $500.  How about
the rest of you??  Can we make this happen.  I have all the details of the
banjo from Avram and Larry now and I am pricing it.  They have told me where
to get the best prices and Avram has put me in touch with a guy that just
bought one and researched prices for weeks.  I will update you when I have a
little more info.  OK???????????????????

Riddles is on there for at least one night, plus his "woman," I imagine. 
Then we got Bobby most likely coming late on Sat night, after his gig in 
Davis.
Jeff--what can I help with?? What about her present... are we all getting 
her a banjo, or do you have something else you want to get her, leaving us 
to fend for ourselves?

Chapeau!
