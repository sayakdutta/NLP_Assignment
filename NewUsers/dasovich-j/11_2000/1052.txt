Rob:
Here's a quick and dirty list of some lessons from California that Alberta 
may not want to repeat.  Steve, let me know if I've missed any messages we're 
using to describe California's woes (or mangled any, for that matter.  If you 
have any questions, don't hestitate to get in touch. 

Best,
Jeff
