The Governor's response to FERC will be available at noon tomorrow (12/1) on
his website (http://www.governor.ca.gov/), and in room 4203 in the Capitol.
Both Lynch and Kahn will be sticking around after the Green Team meeting in
room 4203 to answer press questions, although it is not a press conference.
