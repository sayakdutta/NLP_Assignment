My bet is that Pat will be at NARUC.  I think that Michael Moore, PhD 
Economist and CEC commissioner would be very good (I tried Bilas--he's got a 
conflict) and don't think it's a problem that he and Larson are both on 
because they'll come with two quite different takes.  

P.S. FERC dropped a bomb on California today.
