Hi, Marcie.  I've added two things to the end of the update:

PG&E/Edison sue the PUC in federal court to recover procurement costs.
Edison files proposal with PUC to declare rate freeze is over and establish a 
new rate freeze at 110% of old rate freeze that would last for 5 years.

I don't have all the details to fill in, though some of the details might be 
available from the PG&E/Edison websites, and Sue and Mona might have 
additional info.

Hope this helps.

Best,
Jeff
