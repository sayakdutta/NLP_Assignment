John:

I haven't received an email from you about tomorrow's meeting.  
Unfortunately, I need to reschedule.  I apologize---you may have read in the 
papers about the electricity "crisis" underway in California.  It's taking up 
a considerable amount of my time these days.  I would be happy to reschedule 
for next week.  Wed-Fri.  Just let me know.

Best,
Jeff
