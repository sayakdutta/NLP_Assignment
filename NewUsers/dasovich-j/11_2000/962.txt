Thank you for the note.  I'm very much looking forward to meeting you, and 
hope that you can visit the office while your hear to discuss California.  
How long will you be visiting?

Dear Jeff
 
I understand from Mark Schroeder tha you will be on the Berkeley panel after 
mine.  I look forward to meeting you and learning more about the present 
situation there. You could contact me at my hotmail address this weekend if 
you needed to.
regards
Stephen Littlechild
