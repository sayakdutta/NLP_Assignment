If you would make an oyster stuffing - that would be really grand!  Not one 
for inside the bird - but a separate one - does that work?  I'm doing the 
cranberries tonight - but if yours is different from normal (!) we can always 
have another!
 

great time.  thanks a million.  sorry i had to do homework for some of it. 
what would you like me to cook/bring for friday?  i make a mean oyster 
stuffing.  and my homemade cranberry sauce is ok, too.  just let me know.
