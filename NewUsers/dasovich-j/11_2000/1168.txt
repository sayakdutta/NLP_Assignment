Mr. Dasovich,

Hello, my name is Adam, and I work as an administrative assistant to 
Ms. Susan Landwehr in Enron's Minneapolis satellite office.  She has 
asked me to compile an address list of several of her colleagues, 
including yourself.

Unfortunately, I have been unable to find your street address or that 
of your coworker, Mona Petrochko.  If you could email this 
information back to me, it would be much appreciated.  Thanks.

Adam Kristensen
ENRON Corp.
