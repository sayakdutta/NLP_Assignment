I've got an idea.  Howzabout Ted cooks and you clean up?  Seriously, though, 
I'll try to host next time at my humble apartment.

No problemo!  Maybe I will cook for us next time...oh, that's right I don't
cook anymore...

I thought we did a good job of cranking things out.  Have a good weekend!





thanks again for hosting.  most kind of you, and we seemed to make a lot of
progress.  did you get enough money for dinner?
