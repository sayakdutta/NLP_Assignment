My own "family" enabling Bush - woe is me!! 
 


because he's more of a political robot. The logical choice is, of course, as 
Jeff pointed out, Nader. The result will be that Nader loses, Gore loses, 
and Bush wins. But, four bad years is worth the  political message it will 
send, especially if it's strong. People must perish in wars of belief! (I 
saw a movie about Communist Russia last night, so excuse the slogans.) 
Furthermore, the poor Democrats should remember the days when 'ole Ross "I 
got a pig in my pocket" Perot stole countless votes from the Republicans. In 
such an election, it's time to go with one's conscience, not the lesser of 
two evils. 
I've spoken. 
LATE!
