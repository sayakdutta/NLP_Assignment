I have NO idea how I sent the email to jackie at kim's email address.  
apologies.  i'm losing it.  

did you guys meet last nite to discuss the project?  If not, do you want to 
meet this weekend for a wee bit to discuss?  i'm in town.  just let me know.  
i can't find ted's email on any notes and i'm too lazy (flaky) to search it 
out.

best,
Jeff

My schedule has blown apart for tomorrow--traveling.  Possible to meet this 
weekend to discuss the project?  Either day's fine with me.  Apologies for 
the last minute change.

Best,
Jeff
