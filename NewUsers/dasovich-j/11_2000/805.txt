I agree with much of what Jeff has written.  Here are some additions -

On FERC getting a lot right, look at the Order in relation to our 4 key 
points filed in the White Paper -
Removing Market Transparency - Still need FERC to take action
Development of Forwards Market and Risk Management - Great results
Removing distortions on Prices - Wrong action
Ending Cal ISO / Cal PX Stakeholder Boards - Great results

On the risk management issue, FERC itself said "The single most important 
remedy that California market needs is the elimination of rules that prevent 
market participants from managing risk". [FERC PRESS RELEASE]

ADD - FERC Staff did a great job on preparing a detailed analysis of the 
market issues.

Here are the messages as I understand them.  Please let me know if I've 
misconstrued anything.  Thanks.

FERC got  a lot right in the order and we're very encouraged as a result.
In particular, ending the PX buy/sell requirement and permitting utilities to 
manage risk through a portfolio of short and long term contracts is a 
fundamental step in the right direction.
However, the proposed price cap is unworkable and will jeopardize realibility 
in California.  As structured, it will:
discourage the development of new generation to serve California
fail to provide adequate incentives for demand responsiveness.
force Enron to abandon 300 MWs of new power projects planned for California.
We look forward to participating in FERC's process and are hopeful that 
FERC's final order will fix the deficiencies in the current price cap 
proposal.
We encourage California to work with FERC to implement the proposals and 
quickly fix the flaws in the market on behalf of the state's consumers.
