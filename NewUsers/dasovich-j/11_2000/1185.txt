Isn't "hornswoggled and bamboozled" a Rogers & Hart song?

I don't know whether or not you read  the article I sent about contesting
the election,  but I went a step further and listened to and watched the
video associated with that article.  The first  lawyer, Earl Carroll, who
spoke against contesting the election during the James Baker press
conference, used  the argument that many ballots from other counties in
Florida and other states contained no vote for President.  He called them
"non votes."  Therefore, we shouldn't think it unusual for that to happen in
the counties where Gore wants the recount.  What kind of sophistry and
deception is this?  Democrats and all fair-minded people are being
hornswoggled and bamboozled by this kind of propaganda.  It makes me think
that Goebles (I forget how he spelled his name) was really an amateur.  I'm
afraid we're not going to be able to combat this.  Democrats are not devious
enough to anticipate what Bush's strategists may do next.
