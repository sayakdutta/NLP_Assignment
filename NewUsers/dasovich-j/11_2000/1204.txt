Greetings Art.  Had a great time at the conference.  Thanks for inviting me.  
I have a comment about the proposed decision if you'd like it.  Let me know.  
What time do you need it?  And can I just email it to you?  It'll be quite 
brief and to the point.

Best,
Jeff

Mike, I cannot find a phone number for you, but wanted to see if 
you had a comment on the Bilas PD in the gas industry 
restructuring case. 
Is there some element of the comprehensive settlement worth 
fighting for? Do you see any of the issues gravitating to the Sempra 
OII?

Any response appreciated. Thursday is deadline day. 415-824-3222

Thanks,
