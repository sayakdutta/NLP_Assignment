Since Scott is not available at 1:30... he indicated to me that 12:30 -or- 
between 2 - 3:30 would work for him...
how about you folks?
Pls advise,
Thanks
Joseph

I can't do it.  I have a 1:00 p.m. appointment out of the office and I won't 
be
reachable until 2:00 p.m.  I must leave the office at 3:45 p.m.
