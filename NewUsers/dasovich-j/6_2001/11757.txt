Glad to hear it.  Let me know, once you've met, if there's any there there.

Best,
Jeff

Joe, meet Joe.  My apologies.  I've had trouble getting contact information 
for Joe (Kaishkill).  Joe  K. could you confirm that you've received this 
note.  Also, I left you Joe A.'s phone contact numbers on your Houston 
voicemail last week.  Joe A. could you please send Joe K. your contact 
numbers again?  Thanks very much.  

If there's anything else either of you need, please don't hesitate to let me 
know.

All the best,
Jeff

Hello Jeff:

like to contact Joe Kaischkill in anticipation of my trip to schedule time 
with him. Could I get a contact # or email to intitiate contact?

Thanks for your help once again.
Best regards,
