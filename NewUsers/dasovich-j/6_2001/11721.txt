Joe:

You can expect a call from Joe Kaischkill about setting up a meeting in Sao 
Paolo to discuss your proposal.  Let me know if there's anything else that I 
can do to help.

All the best,
Jeff

Jeff:

I did a final draft of the one-pager I sent you earlier. I am attaching it 
here as it communicates the idea better. Please send along to whomever you 
feel should recieve it and let me know when I can contact who & when. I will 
be traveling on Friday am for 1 week.
Thank you.
Joe Alcantara
