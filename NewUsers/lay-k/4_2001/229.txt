Thank you, but no interest at this time.










Dear Kenneth, 
I was wondering if you could tell me if Enron is currently considering an IT 
department portfolio management solution, which is basically software that 
manages IT projects and the availability, as well as the skill sets, of your 
internal IT staff. If you would be interested, I can forward you information 
on our product, or arrange an onsite demonstration. Thank you.

Regards, 
Joe
