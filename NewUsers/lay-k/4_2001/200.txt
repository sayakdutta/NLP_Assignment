Dear Stuart:

I appreciate the e-mail concerning the Board of Trustees for The Institute 
for Advanced Study in Musical Theatre.  You do indeed have a very impressive 
board. 

I am still thinking about the possibility of serving on your board.  But at 
the earliest, it would be late this year before I could entertain any 
involvement.  With your indulgence, I will keep you advised.

Warm regards,

Ken







Dear Ken:

The Institute for Advanced Study in Musical Theatre (IASMT) Board of
Trustees is presently constituted as follows:

Jerry Bock
Edgar M. Bronfman
Schuyler Chapin
Leo Linbeck III
Carlisle Floyd
Stuart Ostrow
William Safire
Stephen Sondheim

I pray you have thought happily about joining us, now that we are embarked
on a great journey into the unknown.   It was G.K. Chesterton who expressed
so eloquently the purpose of art and religion - "to remind us that we've
forgotten who we are."   (If only once a year, with six months advance
notice.)

Eagerly,

Stuart
