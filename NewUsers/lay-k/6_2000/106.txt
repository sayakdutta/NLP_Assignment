Dear Mr. Carmona -

Everything you have is correct.  I don't have an exact arrival time on July 
28 at this point.

Dear Rosalee:

As far as we know, Kenneth Lay is planning to take a private jet to
participate in Aspen ISIB's Business Leaders Dialogue taking place in Aspen,
Colorado, July 27 - 30th. He will be a little late - arriving July 28th. In
addition, it is our understanding that he will not require sleeping
accommodations at the Aspen Meadows for the period of the Dialogue.

If any aspect of this information is incorrect or if there have been any
changes in his itinerary or required accommodations, please let us know
immediately.

Kind Regards, and Many Thanks for your help and patience in this process.


Kind Regards,


Godwin Carmona
Program Coordinator
Aspen ISIB
