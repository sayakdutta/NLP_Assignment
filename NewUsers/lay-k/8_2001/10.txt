The purpose of this memo is to reassure you that the direction, philosophy, and importance of the Program remains unchanged.  As we have said many times, most of our new businesses were created by graduates and members of the Program.  Many of the current leaders of our company are also graduates of the Program.

Three broad principles will continue to guide the direction of the Program.
?	We will have only one Associate/Analyst Program at Enron, and it is a Company asset.
?	We will have a "One Enron" presence on campus to provide clarity of message and purpose.
?	The Program is rotational in nature, and will prepare our future leaders for success by providing exposure to Enron's network of people and systems.

The business prospects for Enron, and the opportunities for personal growth and development have never been better.  We also enjoy the deepest and broadest talent pool we have ever had.  Each and every one of you can be a key contributor to making Enron the World's Leading Company.
