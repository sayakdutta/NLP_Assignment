Rosalee for Ken Lay







Ken-I have revised the term sheet provided to us by George yesterday along
the lines that you suggested to give the partners somewhat stronger rights
on the choice of seats and suites.  These rights are not as strong as the
rights the Partnership got from the Astros, but I hope they will be
considered sufficient by the partners.  I received an e-mail yesterday from
Conoco reiterating Archie's concern on the preferential rights.  So far, all
of the partners  I've heard from on the financing term sheet are OK with it.
However, I haven't yet heard from Ric Campo on the financing term sheet.
