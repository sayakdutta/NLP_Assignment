Thanks, Maryse.  This is very helpful.  







Dear Rosalee,

The Council meeting in Geneva will take place on 31 August-1 September. As
is a tradition, it will start with a dinner on Thursday 31 August and end
on Friday 1 September at around 3 pm, so that the Council members can still
return home for the weekend.
A detailed agenda and further information will be sent out in the next
weeks.
I hope that this preliminary information will be of help to you. If you
have any specific questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
Best regards,
Maryse
Executive Assistant to the President

Mr. Smadja -

You may not be the person to ask, but I am trying to get information for
Dr. Lay for the World Economic Forum Advisory Council meeting in Geneva in
late August.  Can someone please send Dr. Lay a schedule, so he can plan
accordingly?

Thank you.
