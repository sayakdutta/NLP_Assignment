FYI re:  NEPCO picketing issues.  Michelle

 


Michelle,

Two in one day.  We understand that the pipe fitters are also planning to
picket the Lake Worth, Florida project as well.  Our execution team needs to
get some guidance and planning for this picketing should it interfere with
the progress of the work.  In that respect, we need to dial in Rick Johnson
and Olgletree to plan and communicate that plan to the execution team.  I
think the first step is a call between yourself, me, Mark Stubley and Mike
Indivero.  And then another call with all folks or a meeting at the jobsite
to lay out the plan.

Barbara, please organize a call for Mike, Michelle, Mark Stubley and me.
Thanks.

David,



I have been advised by our Construction Manager, Mr. Joe Osler that while he
was visiting the City of Lake Worth Building Planning and Zoning dept
regarding our permit status he learned that the pipefitters have inquired
about permit requirements to picket our site.  Apparently the City informed
them that no permit is required.  I have heard that the pipefitters have
established a picket line at the Payne Creek site today. We will need local
legal counsel to assist us in this regard.



Mike Indivero, I understand that Mr. Mike Croall's release date from NEPCO
is Oct 31, 2001.  Please advise as to who his replacement is and their
report date.



Thanks,



Galen J. Torneby
