Rick,

Nice kudos from Robert.

Would you mind keeping Diane Goode in the loop on this.  As you may recall, she had done a summary of the legal requirements and sent it on to the generalists.  They now are calling her for help, so her knowing what you are doing is essential.

Thanks.

Michelle

Attachment provides a compilation of Enron's policy treatment and considerations in granting employees a leave of absence for military or emergency duty.  After leadership's validation, HR Risk Management would propose distributing this policy guidance to all US domestic HR Generalists.   Thank you for your review and comments.  Regards, Rj.
