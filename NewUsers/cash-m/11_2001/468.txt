Pam,
 
I guess a separate line of inquiry is whether we owe him payments under his employment contract.  We probably should get with Castleman this week.

Michelle -
 
Your thoughts?
 
 



Hi Rob,
 
I hope all is well with you and also that Enron is making full use of your experience and talent during this very difficult time.
 
I've been trying to get in touch with you by phone and as I realize you must be in all day meetings I thought I'd switch to email. In your message last time you asked me to get in touch with you this last Wednesday when you would have the outcome of Joe Dilg's review of the ECI contract and my employment contract (at least that's what I thought I understood but the message was breaking down).
 
As I have been postponing a deal I need to close for as long as I possibly can I really would appreciate it if you could provide me with the name of someone at Enron, in case you are swamped with other issues, with the authority to make the payments. As I mentioned before, the payments were due a few months ago and I'm now in real danger of not being able to close the deal at all if the payment is delayed further.
 
ESA is telling me I need to talk to Houston but I did not want to call Ken Lay's office at a time like this.
 
Please send me an email and also if you get some time please drop me a line to catch up on the personal side. I've been busy setting up my business in London and I think I should be ready to go with a couple of new ventures by the end of November. 
 
Best regards,
 
Diomedes.
