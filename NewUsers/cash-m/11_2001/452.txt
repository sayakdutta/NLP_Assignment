In response to my firm-wide email regarding set off for WARN notice: I rece=
ived a plan that included the following language:
The severance benefits provided under this Plan (including any additional b=
enefits provided pursuant to authority reserved in [company] under the prov=
isions of this Plan) are the maximum benefits that [company] will pay.  To =
the extent that any federal, state or local law, including, without limitat=
ion, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act (WARN) and any o=
ther so-called "plant closing" laws, requires [company] to give advance not=
ice or make a payment of any kind to an Eligible Employee because of that E=
mployee's involuntary termination due to a layoff, reduction in force, plan=
t or facility closing, sale of business, change of control, or any other si=
milar event or reason, the benefits provided under this Plan shall be reduc=
ed by the amount of such payment. Notwithstanding any other provision of th=
e Plan to the contrary, an Employee's Severance Benefits shall not be less =
than the amount required by WARN, and in the case of an Enhanced Severance =
Benefit, shall not be less than the amount required by WARN plus an additio=
nal amount to be determined by the Employer.=20
Hope this is helpful.  Let me know if there is any big news at Enron.  Thin=
gs appear to be moving fast.=20
