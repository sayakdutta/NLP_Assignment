What a delightful and welcome change of pace in my email today!

Definitely count us in.  We'd love to join you.

By the way, do you have Mata Kroger's new phone number?  Or, is she still with Comsys?

Thanks!

Michelle

 


Hi stranger -- I am checking to see if you and Trey can join the Krummes  and us for champagne brunch on Sunday, Dec 16 at 10:30 at Cafe Noche.  Rob  is coming in for our Christmas party and is leaving for Austin right after  brunch.  We are both excited to have a whole night and next morning without  kids.  Let us know if you guys can join us.
