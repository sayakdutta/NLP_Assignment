Leslie, 

I have just learned that the Holland Club event will overlap with this event by about 30 minutes -- St. Nicholas arrives at 10:30, so Cameron probably wouldn't get his gift until 11:00 at the earliest.  Also, since it is out in the boonies, it would take a while to get back inside the loop.  

Would it be possible for us to arrive late?  I'd hate to create a disturbance, but I think Cameron would like to attend both things.

Thanks!

Michelle

 

I booked the Santa lunch and have you guys down for 3.  Sat. Dec. 1 at 11:30 am.  No cancellations after Nov. 23, so just let me know before then if the other event presents a conflict.  Dress Cameron in his Christmas finery for his photo with Santa!
