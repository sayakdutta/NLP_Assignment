Attached is a 12-Month Direct Compensation Profile document which we have 
asked Chris Tull to program (final programs need to be completed by 8/30/00).

Michelle:  We'd appreciate it if you will review the document and write the 
appropriate legal disclaimer that should be placed on the bottom of the 
document.

Chris:  The document includes the revisions we talked about.  Also, the 2nd 
page of the 1st worksheet includes all the add'l cash comp to include (by 
codes).

Pam:  This is the document Robert shared with you.  Do you foresee any 
problem with the data to be reflected in the document?
