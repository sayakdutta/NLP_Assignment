Before we put this together I need to confirm what confidentiality 
obligations we have with respect to PSE.  Do you have a copy of that 
agreement?  

I am copying Michelle and Rick, since they may have been involved in the 
earlier matter.

We are pursuing an outsourcing opportunity with Puget Sound Energy.   Their 
field employees are represented by IBEW Local 77.  The Business Manager's 
name is David Timothy.

We'd like to put a confidentiality agreement in place with Local 77, so that 
we can share with them our response to Puget's Request for Information.  We 
all seem to recall that an Enron/IBEW agreement was prepared once before, 
either for Anaheim or West Oregon. As is typically the case, we can't seem to 
find a copy!

Can you help out?  If you can't find one, let me know and I'll describe the 
scope we need for local 77.

Thanks
