Kerry/Michelle:

	ETS HR has been reviewing the current above-referenced pay practice, the legal landscape surrounding this issue, and various approaches to address the matter.  We feel it is time to meet and hopefully reach consensus as to a recommended course of action.

	Please let me know what day(s) later this week and next would be available for you to meet for an hour or two.  I'll then coordinate scheduled on my end and confirm a date and time.  Thanks,

Brian
