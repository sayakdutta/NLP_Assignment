Noel, here are my suggested revisions:


In order to represent an incentive for the Beneficiary to remain in the Com=
pany, the Beneficiary will be vested in the right to exercise an option as =
follows: (a) up to 15% of the stock options granted on the granting date; (=
b) up to 30% of the stock options granted as of six (6) months following th=
e granting date; (c) up to 45% of the stock options granted as of twelve (1=
2) months following the granting date; (d) up to 60% of the stock options g=
ranted as of eighteen (18) months following the granting date; (e) up to 75=
% of the stock options granted as of twenty-four (24) months following the =
granting date; (f) up to 90% of the stock options granted as of thirty (30)=
 months following the granting date; and (g) up to 100% of the stock option=
s granted as of thirty-six (36) months following the granting date.  The ri=
ght of the Beneficiary to the stock option will only be available once vest=
ed.  The Beneficiary may exercise vested options within the validity period=
 of five (5) years from date of grant.  In no event may Beneficiary exercis=
e or have any rights to unvested options. In no event may Beneficiary exerc=
ise or have any rights in a stock option after the term of the validity per=
iod expires.


 

Pam

The ESA lawyers sent us a draft of the "evergreen agreement" that the emplo=
yees are going to sign before they receive options and base salary increase=
s.  Could you make sure the wording for the vesting schedule (highlighted i=
n yellow) is acceptable.
