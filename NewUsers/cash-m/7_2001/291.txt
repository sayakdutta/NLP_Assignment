Congratulations!!!!  I know you are happy to have that wrapped up.  Michelle

 


My sincere congratulations to  entire negotiation team, specially to Lourdes and Vicente, for  me particularly it has been a pleasure to work with you  and I must say that  being part of a  team  that  has the abilities and  knowledge as this one  does is  refreshing.
We have achieved and surpassed  the  goals  defined in  our strategy and most important we have left EcoElectrica with  in a good position to handle itself  in presence of a union, which is not  an easy thing to achieve, we have also established the  grounds  for a solid open relationship without compromising any managerial principle or economic objective. All in all a job well done!.
 Thanks to all it's been great working with you all.
Regards, Teo
