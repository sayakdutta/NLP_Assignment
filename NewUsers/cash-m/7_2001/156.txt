Mike Indivero has indicated that NEPCO received a discrimination charge emanating from their Lakeland Florida office.  I anticipate assisting Mike in the investigation and subsequent response to the charges received.  Privilege will be warranted for matter and the subsequent OLER inquiries.  In Michelle's absence, would you to establish the initial instructions and subsequent privilege governing this effort?  Regards, Rj.
