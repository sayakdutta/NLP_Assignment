sounds good to me.

 

I spoke with Catherine this a.m..  The vendor is actually a compnay called Bates Churchill. Willaims offices at their facility.  Catherine thought Bates Churchill had an agreement with us, but the company can't find it.  I'm checking the vault, but don't expect to find one. 

Should I just put together a consulting agreement and have Doug Williams sign the Confidentiality Agreement? Thanks.

 

It sounds like we are asking him to do it -- more like a consultant than it originally appeared.  MHC

Hi Kay,

Here is the information you requested. Enron has been asked to write a chapter for the Euro money book. We have hired Doug Williams to put this chapter together on Trading and Investment Perspectives. He will be interviewing several of our weather traders. Thank you for all your help.
