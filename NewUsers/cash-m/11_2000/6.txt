Thanks.  I frequently pick up my first job after I complete my second shift 
at home.  That's why I got the nifty flat screen for my computer -- 
jealous??  Michelle

What are you doing replying to emails at 12:00 on a school night?

I had not seen any of this before they sent it to you, other than him
telling me he was sending you the standard forms.  I am sure everything can
be worked out.  Let me talk to him and get back to you.

Kerry, is this necessary?  I don't agree to all the terms in here, and I
really don't want to spend a lot of time with ELT to negotiate the
agreement.  For example, the part where we will be billed for developmental
costs if we cancel within a certain period of time.  From my perspective,
that is inappropriate since I spent more time than ELT on developing this
product, and  you are simply delivering a product that you and I already
prepared and completed on several occasions across North America.  There
will be one new scripted section, but that should be from the actors, and
it should not be significant.  Also, there are not appropriate
confidentiality provisions, etc.  So, I would have to negotiate it with ELT
for it to be acceptable to us.

The last time, you just billed for time, and the actors billed separately.
I prefer that approach, if we can do it that way.  If I am being a major
prima donna and it creates a big problem for you internally, let me know,
and I can review it and comment back to ELT.

Thanks.  Michelle
