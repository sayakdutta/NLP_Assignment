Tim,

Do you think these depositions will take a day apiece?  Or, can we schedule 
more than one in a day?  Let me know, so that I can arrange schedules.

Thanks for the update!  Good work.

Michelle








Michelle,

 We had the pretrial hearing today before Judge Kaufman.  He granted
our Motion to continue the trial date.
The new date is February 20, 2001.  The next pretrial conference is
scheduled February 2, 2000, and all of the depositions must be completed by
that date.  I further informed the Judge that Enron would make George
McClellan, Tom McQuade, Mike Beyer, Dan Reck, and Andrea Frate Bennett
available in January, 2000.  He will hold Enron to this.

 Therefore, Please obtain dates for the depositions of George
McClellan, Dan Reck, and Tom McQuade, in Houston Texas during the month of
January 2001.  It is my understanding based on past correspondence between
you and Chuck Woody that the Enron Depositions in Houston will occur at
Locke Liddell & Sapp LLP, 3400 Chase Tower, 600 Travis Street, Houston,
Texas 77002-3095.  Further, please do not schedule any of the depositions on
January 16th or 17th because the Plaintiff's counsel will be unavailable on
those days.

 Furthermore, please provide a deposition date for Mike Beyer in
Pittsburgh Pa. during the Month of January 2001.  Again,  the Plaintiff's
counsel will not be available the 16th and 17th of that month.

 Finally, please provide a date for Ms. Frate for January 2001 if
possible that is not on the 16th or 17th.

 I will provide Plaintiff's counsel with a notice of the availability
of Enron employees upon receipt of your response to this E-mail.

 Thanks
