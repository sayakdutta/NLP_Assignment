I've asked them for dates, and I've got them from 2 of them.  Let me bug them 
again early next week.  Tell him to chill out -- his client's deposition has 
been scheduled and rescheduled too many times to count.  







Michelle,

 Clonch's deposition is going to take place this Sunday at Spilman
Thomas & Battle at 9:00 a.m.  I will provide you with a transcript upon
receipt.  Additionally,  counsel for Clonch continues to call me and write
me letters for Deposition dates for Enron officials.  They have provided me
with the following dates on which they will be available in a letter dated
11/27/00:

Jan 3-5
Jan 8-12
Jan 22-26
