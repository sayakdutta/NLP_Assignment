Cheryl,

I am taking 12/1 off as a vacation day -- so, let's play!!!  I have a hair 
appointment Saturday, which I cannot really change this late in the year.  
So, do you want to get a haircut, manicure, or anything else beautifying 
while you are here?  If so, I'll book something for you.  

There is no way we would have you babysit.  In fact, we have a  sitter for 
Saturday night. so we can go somewhere fun for dinner and maybe even see a 
movie or do anything else you may want to do.

I can't wait for your visit!!

Michelle








I'm all set for my Houston visit.  I can't wait.  I get in to Houston about
3:30 on friday Dec, the day after your anniversary.  If you and Trey are
going out for your anniversary I can babysit!  I don't want to cramp your
anniversary celebration. As soon as the travel agent e-mails my intenerary
I'll send it on to you.

Cheryl
