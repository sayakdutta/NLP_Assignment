See attached file; after you open the document below, click on the certification form.  I will send you a copy of the FMLA certification form that Paul Gonzales developed for use at Enron (its basically the same form with the Enron logo).

Here's the link.  You'll have to open the  Certification page as a PDF file and you can print from the PDF file.
