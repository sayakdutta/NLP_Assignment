Kari, this is helpful.  Is there any way we can delete the names of persons who no longer are here?  Thanks.  Michelle

 

Attached is the report you requested.  The report does include Louise Kitchen; however, she is technically assigned to ENW.

 

Please see attached.

 << File: EA Comm EEs - 12-05-01.xls >> 

 

Please pull the following info and put into Excel:

BU = EA
Peer Group = Commercial
EE Status = Active or LOA

List all EEs, sorted by:
	1)  Job Title (high level to low level)
	2)  EE's Name (alpha order)

Be sure to include the following info, if the EE is on an ACTIVE, EXECUTABLE EE Agrmt:
	EE Agrmt Begin Date
	EE Agrmt End Date
