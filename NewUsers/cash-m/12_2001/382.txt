Awesome - you'll have something written?  Let me know when it can be distributed.  Thanks....

 

We are working through that issue this week.  Michelle

 

Hey Michelle,
Did you guys address the non-compete issue for terminated employees?  I have 2 commercial employees who've been told that the non-compete is waived (confidentiality stands).  Has anyone at your end prepared anything in writing?  Please advise asap.  Thanks!
