no, it looked suspicious, so I didn't open it.

Fax is 713-646-3490.




Hi Michelle

I have had trouble with my e-mails, I hope you didn't open the one with the virus that went to all of my sent addresses yesterday.

I have lost all of my e-mails, and along with them your fax number. Could you please tell me it again.


thanks

Brenda
