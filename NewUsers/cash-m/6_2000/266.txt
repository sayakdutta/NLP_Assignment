Jim,

If you are sure you don't want reimbursement, then thanks a lot!!!  I hope 
that you both can join us.  If not, let's plan on another arrangement.  We 
are planning to stay at the Doubletree Suites in/near Georgetown (apparently, 
it is close to the Watergate).  It was way less expensive than the Embassy 
Suites we discussed the other day (approx. $100 per night!).  We are renting 
a car, though, so we can get around wherever we need to -- or, of course, we 
can take the Metro.

Talk to you later.

Michelle

 You owe nothing, and I'll have to let you know later about whether I
(or we) can join you.






Jim, Thanks for this.  Would you please let me know how much we owe?  Would
you
like to join us for the game?  Michelle

     Michelle:  You have 6 seats for the Orioles-White Sox game on Monday
evening, August 14.  These are the "firm seats" that I mentioned -- along
the third baseline above the visitor's dugout.  Game time is 7:35 p.m.  I'll
send the tickets down to you in the next day or two.  Have fun!
