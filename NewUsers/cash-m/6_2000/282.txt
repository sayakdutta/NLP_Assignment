Pam,  I spoke with Rex through several voice mails early this week.  I have 
initialed the agreement and sent it to Gene for signature.  I expect that it 
has been signed already.  Have a great holiday.  Michelle

Michele, can you please provide me with the status?  I never heard back from 
Rex.  Did you?
