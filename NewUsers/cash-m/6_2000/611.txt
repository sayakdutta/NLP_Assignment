Pat,

Given that the new AESOP has been approved by the comp. committee, do you 
think the language attached below should be revised?  (Or, should I ask -- 
has it been revised?).  If so, would it be possible for you to revise for 
inclusion in offer letters, etc.? 

Thanks a lot!

Michelle

This is what we have -but it now seems dated. Do you have a more current 
version I could cut and paste into the Japan offer letter. Thanks

All-Employee Stock Option Program
Enron Corp. has previously awarded stock options to full time and part-time 
regular employees in designated domestic and international locations through 
the All Employee Stock Option Program (AESOP).  Stock option grants were made 
under this program to eligible employees hired prior to January 1, 2000.  The 
grants represented value for the time period of 12/31/94 through 12/31/00 or 
a pro-rata portion if hired after 12/31/94.  A replacement program for beyond 
the year 2000 is under consideration and will likely be reviewed at the May, 
2000 Board meeting.  If approved, this could result in stock option award 
grants to eligible employees.  Program awards are subject to and effective 
upon the approval by the Compensation and Management Development Committee of 
the Enron Corp. Board of Directors.  Such stock awards shall be made pursuant 
to the appropriate Enron Corp. Stock Plan as determined by the Committee.  
The exercise price for grants of stock options shall be determined according 
to the provisions of the Stock Plan under which the award is granted.  This 
program may or may not be offered in certain domestic and international 
locations based upon management discretion and/or local labor and employment 
laws.
