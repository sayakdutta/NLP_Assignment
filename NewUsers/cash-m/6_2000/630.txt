No, it is a European Agreement since she is remaining on UK payroll.  Tara 
found out Michele Small prepared the agreement.  Jon C. reviewed it then but 
now has comments again, plus he is questioning some of our changes.

As you recall, the file that Louise had and has signed is just a draft.  We 
kept making changes based on her request and it has not been reviewed by 
Legal before she signed last week.

Thought this was drafted here by Jane and Michelle? Maybe we get Mich to 
initial and Greg to sign?

David/Jane

Jon Chapman has come back with several changes/questions on the agreement. I 
am not sure who drafted this or what you want me to do with this now. Mark F 
won't sign without Jon C's signature and Jon C won't sign as it is. 

Jane - Please provide your fax number and I will fax it to you asap.

Thanks
Tara

Can you get  Mark's signature?  Once signed, I will get it to London for 
process and sorting out the money.

Thanks for all your help on this.
