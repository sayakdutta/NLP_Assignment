Friends & Colleagues

As a result of the recent restructuring of Human Resources and Enron's 
innovative redeployment efforts, I would like to let you know that I am now a 
member of the Community Relations group!  I am very excited about this new 
and challenging opportunity as Manager of Enron Corp.'s Special Events.

In addition to creatively exploring new ways of getting employees involved, 
I'll also be focusing on how we can align our activities with efforts to 
attract / retain top talent, while at the same time, leveraging our 
initiatives in the community and maintaining a global perspective.  

My new contact details are provided below:

Location: EB416

I'll be looking for ways we can all work together so consider this fair 
warning!   Hope you are all doing well & please stay in touch!!
