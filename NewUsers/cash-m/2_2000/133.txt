Great.  Our only plans are that we have tickets to the ballet on Saturday 
night.  If you want to attend, let me know, and we will get tickets.  It is 
Cleopatra -- a world premier -- and it should be entertaining.  I understand 
if you don't want to join us, though.  Ballet isn't for everyone.  Let me 
know.  Michelle








Thanks - your timing is uncanny - I was just starting to consider a change.
Rog and I are looking forward to seeing you during the weekend of March 11-12.
I'll be in touch soon about our plans - mms
