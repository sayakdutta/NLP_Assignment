Dear Maaico,

Congratulations on the birth of daughter Laura!  She looks great -- very healthy and all.  It also is great to see how little Bart is growing up.  He is a beautiful boy!  You must be so happy and proud to have two healthy children.  

I will send you some fun pictures of my son, Cameron, who has learned to stand on his head -- he is very proud.

Congratulations again, and take care.

Love,

Michelle


 


Hello  All,
 
Els  gave birth to our healthy daughter Laura last Tuesday. It went almost  perfect. Labour started at 15.00 and at 19.05 Laura was there.  Unfortunately we had to go to the hospital at 21.30 because Els was still losing  some blood. It was not much of a problem and she could return home the next  morning.
 
Attached some photo's of the new  one.
