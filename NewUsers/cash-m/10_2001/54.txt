Michelle,

I rec'vd the FAXed DRAFT document for Laird Dyer.  The contract is fine.  Please execute the agreement and send to Robert to sign.

NOTE:  There is not a signed copy of the Confidentiality and Intellectual Property Rights Agreement in Laird's file.  He is signing the Agreement w/ today's date (10/15/01).

Thanks!  Julie K
