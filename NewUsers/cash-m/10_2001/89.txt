I think you should be there, so it can wait until later in the week.  Other priorities obviously govern.  Thanks.  Michelle

Here is the revised review (password - oberon).  I have meetings scheduled for the afternoon and am not sure I will be able to get out of them at any particular time.  Does it make sense to give her the review without me being there and meet later or not?

	FYI

 

	Yes, I spoke with Mark on last Thursday and the revisions are complete.  He will let me know today when the 
	three of us can meet to discuss.

Hey Fran, I am just following up from our meeting the week before last.  Were we able to make any progress since then getting any revisions?
