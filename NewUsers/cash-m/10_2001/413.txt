Unbelievable!!  I guess he has sour grapes.  We only paid him not to apply for a job -- unfortunately, insults were not contemplated in our agreement.  Ignore him.  Michelle

WOW Enron stock at $11.10 per share are you buying??  
It has been a year since I was escorted out of the 
Enron building by security because I did not fit the 
Enron culture.  WHAT BULLSHIT.

transportation trading platform, did it happen?
