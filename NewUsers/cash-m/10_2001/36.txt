I agree -- involve Valeria.  You also should invite my new lawyer, Lizzette Palmer.  Twanda is her assistant, also.  Thanks.  Michelle

Dear all, 

I had a meeting today with the PEP team as they were interested in our system expectations for Year-End PRC relative to diversity.   I gave them a few ideas but indicated that I wanted to get your thoughts and requirements.   I would like to meet with you next week to review  your thoughts and expectations.   We have a little more time to plan and get the review process completed earlier.  

 I will have Jo Ann schedule a meeting next week.  

Michelle, I think it would be a good idea to include Valeria Hope.  She was instrumental in helping me last year.
