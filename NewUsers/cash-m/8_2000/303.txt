Attached is my due diligence template for Canada.  Please feel free to use 
those parts of it you feel appropriate.  Michelle, if I do not hear back I 
will assume the deal team has decided to have the counsel handle this in my 
place.  Please be sure to let Patrick Wade know.  If I can be of any other 
assistance please let me know.
