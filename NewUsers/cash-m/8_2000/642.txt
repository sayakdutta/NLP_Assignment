As we had talked about last week, I'd appreciate if you would have the 
attached document (proposed IT Retention Equity program) reviewed for legal 
purposes.  Particular attention needs to be paid to the area that addresses 
employees on leave of absence.  The excel document includes 3 worksheets 
which are the attachments to the Write-Up.
