Michelle, 
As regards yesterday's meeting on PRC descriptors, I understood that we were 
going to move from the "Strong" through "Needs Improvement"  categories  to 
numbers 1-5 (or 1-6 if we decide not to combine the last two categories), and 
that we were going to assign relative descriptors to the new number 
categories.  My task is to come up with some good verbiage for the 
descriptors.  

I'd like to chat with Dick, if this is possible, for his additional input as 
I go along with this.  Does he have a phone number in Enron or an email 
address at which I may reach him. 

I am leaving for a mini-vacation to Cape Cod tonight --will be back on 
Monday.  But intend to work on this over the weekend so that I have something 
in hand early next week for us to discuss.  Does this work for you? 

Many thanks in advance, 

Gina
