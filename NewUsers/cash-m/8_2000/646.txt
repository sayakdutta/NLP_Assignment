I think that gathering this information at interview makes the most sense.  
Obviously, new hire orientation is too late!  I prefer an original, signed 
document, but a fax is an ok substitute, provided that the applicant mails us 
the originals after faxing.  Thanks.  MHC

Having the candidate fill out the employment application and authorization to 
complete a background check at the time they are interviewed.
Or, told they have to return these two documents along with their signed 
offer letter by mail/fax.

I think faxing would be quicker.  

Some candidates are being told they can complete these forms during new hire 
orientation.

Hope this helps.
Thanks
Cynthia



   
	
	
		



Cynthia & Toni, 
What changes or processes can we implement so that we can have background 
checks before the employee starts?

The following are scheduled to start on Monday, 8/28, we have either not 
recevied their completed background checks or have not processed them because 
we have not received necessary paper work to process.

Chris Price   processed - not complete He says there is nothing to worry 
about.
Patricia Houston processed - not complete
Stanton Brown  not processed
Beverly Filer  not processed
Prescilla Hamic  not processed

As soon as the paper work is received, the background checks will be 
processed.

Please advise if okay.
Thanks
