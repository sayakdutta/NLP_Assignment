Diane, not a high priority, but would you please get with Kim Melodick and find out what the client group wants to do with the Alonzo Williams lawsuit?  He never answered, and currently is in default.  Thanks.  Michelle

Michelle:
	By my calculation Alonzo Williams' answer date will be Dec. 26. He was
served on November 29. I haven't heard anything.
	It occurred to me that we often are successful in resolving these things
quickly and cheaply by having someone at Enron call a contact at the new
company, TXU, and bring the issue to a head. So far as I know no one has
made such a call in this case.  I recall from the Union litigation a few
years ago there was an Enron exec who went to TUFCO by the name of Mark
McNally. We deposed Mark in that case and he was very professional and
cooperative. McNally had been at Enron and (I believe) Houston Pipeline for
15-17 years. He's now been with TXU 4 or 5 years and is CFO. A call to him
might get this off dead center. I'm copying Mark on this email because I
know Mark knows McNally well.
	What do you think?
	Best regards,
	Bill
