Hi, Janel,

I thought that I initialed those already.  If I didn't, I'll do it when I get back after my vacation next week.

In the meantime, go ahead and forward them to the counterparty for signatures on both originals and then have someone at VP level sign for Corp.  If I didn't initial, you should get them initialed before giving them to the corporate officer, because company policy requires attorney initials on all legal documents before signature.

Once signed, the original goes to the vault; we can take care of that for you.

I'll be out next week, but if you have questions, please call Diane Goode, who works in my group.  She can either assist you or find someone else who can.

Thanks.

Michelle

Hi Michelle,

I received the two executable copies of the CSA between Enron and KDS Communications.  I'm not sure what the next step is.  Should I overnight these to Ken to sign and then receive them back and sign on this end and he gets one and we get one?  And I'm assuming that no one else in legal has to sign off at this point?  I thought Linda Glynn mentioned something about Richard or someone else providing initials???  

Just let me know.  thanks!

Also does legal keep a copy or do we keep the contract with us?
