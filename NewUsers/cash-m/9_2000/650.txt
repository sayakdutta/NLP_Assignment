Sharon, Kriste, and I discussed this, and agreed that simple was better.  We 
also thought that a reference to the Enron Employee Data Protection Policy 
and the Code of Ethics provisions on data should be referenced, with a link, 
if possible.  Thanks. Michelle








If we place this on every page, I'd recommend we keep it simple and clear as 
is below.  

If we need to establish an accept/decline box I'd recommend we build it so 
the user only has to accept once, after which an intranet cookie would 
remember that the user accepted and wouldn't burden the user with the 
question each and every time.

Dear Andrea:  I am in agreement with the proposed statement.  Does anyone 
believe that we need a longer statement.

Thanks. 

Sharon

Dear all, 

We are about to embark on opening up more Enron people data to the general 
Enron population (i.e. expertfinder).  I want to ensure the appropriate risks 
have been identified, documented and agreed upon by the Enron executive 
staff.  Michelle mentioned last week that we may want to consider putting 
some proprietary statement on our applications that house people data. 
Therefore, I would like to have an agreed upon statement that can be posted 
in our applications. 
Here's one to get you started.  I would like to have this finalized by 
Tuesday September 25th.  Thanks. ay

'Enron proprietary information, for internal use only.'
