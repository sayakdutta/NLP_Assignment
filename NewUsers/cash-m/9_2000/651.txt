Mary, I won't be able to call her until next week because I'm going to be 
out/tied up the rest of this week.  I am fine if you want to call her.  My 
only caution would be that you give her data only about our structure -- not 
why we set it up the way we did or anything else that would be privileged and 
confidential.  The structure itself would not be privileged -- only our 
strategies and basis for setting it up that way would be.  If you don't mind 
a delay in the return call, I'll do it next week.  Just let me know.  
Thanks.  Michelle

Is it more appropriate for you to call?

Thanks!

Mary, the above called Peggy Menchaca (who passed the message to me.) They 
are in the process of doing a benchmarking study on non-compete clauses. 
Could you help them out?
