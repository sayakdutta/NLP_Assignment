Pat, do you have any insight as to the question below?

Bridgeline is a JV between Enron and Texaco.  Currently, Enron and Texaco have been assigning employees to work for Bridgeline, with no change in employment status.  Most employees rotate back to their "home" company within a few months.  Now, we are considering spinning off the entire arrangement and creating a separate entity.  The assigned employees would be part of the transaction and would become employees of Newco.  How does that impact the question below?

Thanks!

Michelle

Best regards

Barbara,

I have been trying to get a legal question answered and Jeanie Slone suggested I run the question by you.  Will the Bridgeline "employees" be considered terminated from Enron/Texaco OR will they fall under the Same Desk Rule?  I had assumed that this is a legal question...to be decided by the legal department.  Is that a correct assumption?  Any insight you have would be much appreciated!

Thanks

As you know this is not a simply question.  On the surface this sounds like a 'transfer' from one participating Enron employer to a non-participating Enron employer which would mean that the impacted employees are actually terminating one payroll company and being hired by another.  However, you all need to feret out the exact details and make sure if we know if there is any divestiture issues.  In addition to the 401(k) we need to make sure we know how the other benefits will be handled.

Please coordinate a call between yourself, Pat Mackin and Sarah to get the specifics before guidance is provided.  
Thanks

We are looking in to rolling over some Enron employees to Bridgeline (payroll + benefits) - for purposes of setting up the 401K I need to know whether the Texaco/Enron employees will be treated as Terminated or whether they will fall under the same desk rule.  I posed this question to legal first (Michelle Cash) and she suggested I ask you. (see below)


Thanks,

I don't know.  I would suggest that you ask Cynthia Barrow for starters.  Sorry I am so clueless.  MHC

I am working with Jeanie Slone on the Bridgeline rollover.  In working on the 401K plan, I need to know whether the Texaco/Enron employees will be treated as Terminated or will they fall under the Same Desk Rule. 

Thanks,
