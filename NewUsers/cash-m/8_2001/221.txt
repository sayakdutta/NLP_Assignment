John, how do you want to handle this?  Michelle

Following pushback from Britaldo Soares on the employment agreement we gave him, I had in country HR (Bottone is the VP of HR at Elektro) review our format and run it by his outside council. The attached is the result. Given we still have the same non compete and other principal terms I assume we can utilize it in place of the previous. 

Let me know if you have any problems with this.

Thanks

I'm sending for you the model of AMENDMENT TO THE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT.

It was adapted according Brazil labor law requirements and it was revised by Veirano & Associados Advogados (Legal Counselor).

I believe that Corporate can analyse this model. If they agree with me, we will be implementing in future cases.

Nowadays we continue to use the Enron purpose form, although it contains clauses against our Brazilian
labor law.

If you have any doubts, call me.

Regards.


Alfredo Bottone
