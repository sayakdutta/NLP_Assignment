   I wouldn't put it exactly that way but ...  Sometimes you need to let
   them
   know that if they give a good response, the client can be billed a
   quarter
   hour.  Otherwise, we may not get a response.  I also do not want to bill
   for
   cursory or not well reasoned statements.

      Client received an FMLA leave request based on a Certified
      Nutritionist's
      completion of the serious health condition form.  This does not
   appear
      to be
      a person authorized by the regs to certify a person as having a
   serious
      health condition.  Any thoughts on how to respond to this leave
   request.
      Billable credit for the most helpful response(s).
