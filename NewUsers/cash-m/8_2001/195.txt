Diane, I've left a message for Brian Bloom about this -- would you please follow up, as he either didn't get my message or has not returned my call.  Basically, we did an incentive plan for Enron Investment Partners, and now we want to dissolve it.  Would you ask him to provide a brief overview via email as to what it would entail?  Thanks.  Michelle

I was going to ask Michelle Cash to take a look at it to see if we could dissolve it.  Pam Butler does not want Garland to know we had a carried interest plan.  

Michelle, since you initially were involved, can we quietly dissolve this plan since EIP is no more??  Please advise. Thanks.

Sheila - with the merging of EIP into Enron Principal Investments we need to discuss what happens with the incentive plan we developed for them last year.
