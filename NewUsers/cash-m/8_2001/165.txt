I agree also, but I don't know all the parties or complications involved.  Should there be a (groan) meeting on this?

 

Can you please help with this one?  I agree with what the concern is below.  We have GIS ids, and Eid (external id - just like GIS id).  I think we should try to migrate to one of these. Please let me know what type of statement I should make back to the customer.  Thanks.

 

Kathy,

Per my voicemail message, please review the note below.
I'd like to work with you on a response to this customer.

Thanks,

Brandee

To Whom It May Concern:

Through TV and newspapers , I hear constantly about identity fraud using stolen social security information.    I am very concerned about this issue.

I have the following suggestion for our company.  Since Enron's employees are assigned an SAP identification numbers (P number) and an HR number, could Enron as a company use these IDs instead of the SS numbers?  This will be safer for all employees.

For example, I am concerned when I buy the monthly bus passes and I have to fill in my SS number.  I do not feel secure at all to see my SS in so many databases at Enron, especially when some databases are from third-parties (out-sourcing).  We could use our badge number there instead of our SS.

Please let me know how your organization can help the Enron employees feel safer about the safeguard of their SS number.
