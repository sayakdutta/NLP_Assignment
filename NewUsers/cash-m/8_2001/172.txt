Kathy McMahon suggested that I contact you in an effort to gather information on:
 

Enron's Affirmative Action Policy and plans; as well as 
demographic analysis of workforce (gender, age, ethnic origin, nationality)

 
Jeff Skilling has agreed to work with Harvard Business School (HBS) on a 5-year case study called 'Modern Giants'.  HBS will shadow Enron and a number of other companies over the next five years to assess how we react to market changes and to see how we morph during this time period.  
 
Please let me know at your earliest convience if you can help me.
 
Regards,
 
Cindy
