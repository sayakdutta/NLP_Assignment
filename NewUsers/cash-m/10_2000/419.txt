Dave,

I left you a voice mail that I am available to assist in this process at your 
convenience.  Let me know how you want to proceed.

Michelle, I appreciate your help in finding the services agreement for 
Bridgeline.  However, Trevor Mihalik and I would like to get an agreement set 
up for the outsourcing of Enron's Risk employees.  Do you know who could help 
me get this agreement set up?

Dave
