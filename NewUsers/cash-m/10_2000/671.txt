David,

I am in agreement with you on this.  This week, we lost an agreement that had 
options to be granted.  It did not make it to the Administrative Committee 
until 2 months after signing, and only because the employee came forward and 
asked about her grant.  Luckily for us, the strike price was better/lower.  
If it had been the other way around, we may have had a much bigger issue.

I remain very, very nervous that we have this covered. I need you to get to 
grips with the following and go through it with me asap:

Who is appointed person who is going to co-ordinate all contract activity in 
ENA, EGM, EIM etc., (make sure database is up to date, make sure parameters 
are clear, make sure B/C's know what process is, make sure Corp Comp are in 
loop on VP and above deals, who liaises with legal and makes sure they are in 
loop on all,  etc.,)
Where is the accurate report of existing contracts, those under discussion 
and those top performers who we should think about.
How do we circulate this via HR leads to the OTC's to make sure that we are 
ahead of the game
How do we track the overall numbers, efforts and issues in regards to these 
contracts so that we can feedback a macro picture of their effectiveness.

I suggest we meet before weekend.

David
