Andrea, would it be possible to update our list to show the current progress 
on the "30 days" items?  I think you have a better handle on the timelines 
than I would.  Thanks.  Michelle

Hi Folks:

Enclosed is the agenda for the Corporate HR Leadership Team Meeting that will 
take place tomorrow in the Executive Board Room (50th Floor) from 9:00 to 
10:00. Please note...we will meet in the Board Room not the Dining room on 
the Mezzanine level... Our primary meeting objective will be to review where 
the team stands implementing the short term Action Plans for the Key Focus 
Areas established at the retreat. I understand that some very good work has 
been done and that several potential "Wows" are either currently being 
implemented or about to launch. 

We look forward to getting the latest status reports relative to 
accomplishing these critical activities and keeping the momentum flowing.

Regards, Gerry Gibson
