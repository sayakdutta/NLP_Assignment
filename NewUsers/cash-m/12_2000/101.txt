Richard, My thought is that the first sentence is ok, but not the second, and 
Bonnie is conveying that to McConville's lawyer.  MHC

McConville's counsel has asked us for language in addition to a mere 
representation that the Enron Milford certificate of incorporation applies to 
ENA to the effect that we will cooperate or at least not unreasonably oppose 
Kevin's making a claim for indemnification should the situation arise.  I 
have drafted language along the lines of what I think he is asking for.  Is 
this something that we would consider agreeing to?
