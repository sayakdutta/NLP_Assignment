Alan,

Attached is the resume of Charles Glizzard, a candidate that would like to be 
considered for a Global Markets legal position.  We should probably consider 
him for the role of Marine Transportation specialist, but it appears his 
skill set also shows an ability to do quite a bit more for us.

Kind regards,
Dan
