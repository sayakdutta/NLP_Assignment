Michelle, here is the letter that Kerry and I were able to put together this
morning.  Hopefully this is exactly what you wanted.  If all is o.k., please
sign and fax a copy back to me at 214-880-0181 and send the original to:
      ELT
      Attn: Gary Meisner

Please date the letter for November 30th since we have already started the
preparation for the materials and scheduling.  Thanks
