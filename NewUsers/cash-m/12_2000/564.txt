Hi Michelle.  Is it ok for me to put your initials on Kathy Russeth's CSA 
(for some reason, the version she signed is not the intialled version that I 
think you sent to Sam recently).  I can fax to you the document, as she has 
signed it, for a final check.  Please let me know your preference.  I am in 
the SF office this week - (415)782-7800, or page (800)316-0430.  Thanks.  --  
Karen
