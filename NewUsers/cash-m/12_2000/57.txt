Marty,

Rainer Cockrell has called to ask that we put the Corporate Services 
Agreement in place before the end of the year.  My most recent draft of the 
agreement, dated 11/3/2000, is attached.  Please give it a final look .  
After I hear back from you I will arrange to get David Howe to sign for GSP 
and Bryan Burnett for ENA.

Thanks,

Pete
