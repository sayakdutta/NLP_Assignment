Hello Warriors,

I had expressed an interest in learning about the Black Scholes model, and Eugenio suggested that we get a group of warriors together who would be interested in learning about Black Scholes -- as it is fundamental to understanding derivatives.  If you are interested, please email me and schedules permitting, we can schedule a session this afternoon.
