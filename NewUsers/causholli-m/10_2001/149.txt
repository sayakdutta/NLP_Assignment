Today FOEX published its weekly index for pulp:

For the first time in weeks both the softwoods and the hardwoods show signs of weaknesses again.  

NBSK was down $US0.48 or 0.1% after four weeks of price increases.
BHKP was Euro 466 down Euro 3.34. Expressed in US dollars BHKP was $US416.09 down $US2.33 or 0.56%.
These decline happens despite the recent efforts from the biggest pulp producers, including Weyerhaeuser, to raise prices. This might be a sign of the fact that the market fundamentals  do not support the price increases in pulp. 


The average FOEX for October is:
NBSK: $US 460.68 up $10.26 from September
BHKP:$US 414.76 up $13.67 from the September level
