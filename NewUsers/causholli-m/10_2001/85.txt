Laura,

The pulp inventory is located in the O:/Industrial Markets/Fundamentals/Paper/Pulp/Raw Data.

Check the first tab in the spread sheet. 

Call me if you have any questions.

Hey there,

I am currently working on an inventory forecast for Linerboard and was hoping you could tell me where I can find pulp and OCC inventories.  I am hoping they will be leading indicators for containerboard.

Thanks,
Laura
