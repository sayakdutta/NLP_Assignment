Hey Doug,

Here is what would be great to have:

for Pulp
All the mills, their most updated capacity (can you also find out how often they update the capacity and whether they remove the maintenance related downtime when they come up with the capacity number)
and the type of pulp they produce.

for Printing & Writing paper
same thing for paper too.In addition, what kind of pulp they use to produce the paper.

Can we get the same info in a spreadsheet from too?

thanks,
Monika
