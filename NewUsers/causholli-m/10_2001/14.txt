Andrew,

As a follow-up to our conversation last week I have tried to get the list of mills from PPPC but they are not responding to my requests. There is another way to compile that by using Jacobs Sirrine database information.

Second, I changed the inventory sheet to reflect the latest NORSCAN inventory number that I got from PPPC and so the forecast for October changed a bit, more in line with the historical average now.

Let me know what you want to do on the pulp mills's list and also anything additional in the inventory forecast sheet.
