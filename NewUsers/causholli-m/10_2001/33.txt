Cartiere Burgo's Cellardennes pulp mill in Belgium, is back following a seven-day shut. During the closure, the company installed a new 700 air dried tonne/day ABB pulp dryer at the site that will boost Cellardennes' elemental chlorine-free pulp capacity from 260,000 tonnes/yr to 360,000 tonnes/yr.
