Thank you for letting me know. 
Also, do you have historical data for Utipulp: Consumption, inventory and days of supply?

Can you please help me find these?

thanks again,
Monika Causholli




Dear Monika,

We usually send every month Utipulp statistics figures by email, but our
association decided during the last meeting not to diffused them by email in
the future, only to put on our website : www.utipulp.org. That 's mean that
you will not receive email anymore but you can download directly the current
statistics on the website near the 15th of each month.

Best regards,

Mrs BAERTSOEN
