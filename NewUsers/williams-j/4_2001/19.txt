Hi again,

Hope your feeling better sweety. Good to hear you had a great time away.
Tan? When we were in Fiji you were trying to convince me that you had
one - baby, you have one all year round!! I love your skin.

I will probably be spending 1-2 weeks in London at this stage. We are
trying to plan the rest of our journey in Europe and I'm trying to get
four weeks off so that I can spend even more time with you.

Are both the girls still staying with you? Say hello to Jo for me. I
can't believe I haven't seen her since you left.
Have a great time going out for your B'day this weekend. It's your 30th!
But we both know you have the energy of a an 18 year old when it
counts!!

Speak to you in a couple of days.
Lisa. xx

I had a great time. The weather was macnificent. And I have a great tan.
My
brothers wedding went smoothley.
But its great news that you will be spending more time in London. How
much
time exactley? It would be a marvellous scope if you could pull off a
transfer to London as well. I am currently at the moment feeling a bit
sick
because last night I ate some dodgy food.

Jo and Nichole have settled in to London life. They are both cool. They
have both found jobs so its all going smooth.
We will all be going out this weekend for my birthday.

Love
Jason xxxxxxxxx9
