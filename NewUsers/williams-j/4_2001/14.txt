Effective Friday the 13th of April, I will no longer be employed by Larry
R. Cook & Associates, PC.

I know, I know, the end of an era, you thought you felt the earth slowly
grinding to a halt, etc. etc.  I just had to realize I was just a legend
in my own mind.

I'm moving to the big leagues - I'll be the 35ish employee at MGL Consultin=
g
www.mglconsulting.com - the firm provides comprehensive registration and
compliance services to broker/dealers, investment advisors and insurance
companies.  I'm coming on board to manage the growth of the company through
financial forecasting, modeling and planning as well as being billable
in a role of support for our associate securities attorneys in litigated
matters involving securities - both for and against brokers.

MGL is around the corner from Hewitt Associates in The Woodlands - so
the Suz and I will probably carpool (or walk) to work!

Although it has been a difficult decision to sever my career from Larry,
the opportunity at hand versus the current utility was too great.  We
will remain the best of friends, and as such, will have ready access to
one another as this transition occurs.

For those of you fortunate enough to be clients....I will no longer be
able to serve you in a manner consistent with what you should expect as
I will not be immersed in the day to day operations of the retail financial
world and the information that comes with that.  However, for those of
you not aware, Larry has always reviewed and been aware of all our accounts=
.
 Therefore, you can expect him to continue to monitor and advise you on
your portfolio and planning for years to come.  You do have options: 1)
do nothing and everything continues as is  2) move your account to another
broker  3) change your account to no broker or to another broker of record.
  With any of these options we'll be more than happy to accommodate.
Larry is available if you'd like to meet and/or visit with him at any
time.  Larry and I will continue to work together on clients that I'm
involved with for as long as necessary (i.e. if you still want to place
trades through me or contact me to resolve a move or initiate a rollover,
etc., that's more than great!)

Most of my contact information remains the same:

PS Since I rarely send out a mass email, I'll take the opportunity to
shamelessly advance the Suz and I's other activities - we've opened an
art gallery in Old Town Spring, come by and visit us - www.creeksidecollect=
