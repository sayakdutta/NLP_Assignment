pass on to ferg.

I am going at lunch to buy tickets.  I'm going to look
at the $11 - $15 range.  Let me know how many you need
before tomorrow at 10am.

If any of you can't decide by then, just buy tickets
on your own and we can all meet at cabo for a beer
before the game.

I assume no word from any of you is a 'no'.
