Jason,

     Attached below are the options we had discussed.  The four options we are showing, that did not appear on your report are on the left (columns A through S).  The eight options that were contained on your report that have matured are on the right (columns U through AL).  Please let me know if you agree the four options we show (we have signed confirms if necessary) and whether there is any mtm value calculated on the 8 matured options from your side.  Please give me a call or return note at your earliest convenience.  Many thanks.

Bill
