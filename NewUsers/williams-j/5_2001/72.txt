yeah I comin home first.

 

What are y'all's (yall's, y'alls, other - is there a correct spelling for
slang?) plans for this evening?  Jason, are you coming home first or staying
downtown?  Our babysitter is getting to the house at 7:00 PM.  If y'all want
to ride together, just let us know.

See ya,
