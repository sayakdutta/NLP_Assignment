Dear Mr. Williams:

The credit report you ordered from CreditCheck is now ready for you to view
and download.  Simply come back to the CreditCheck web site Members' Area
(https://www.consumerinfo.com/excite/ua.asp), enter your membership and
passcode numbers, and view/download your report.

Please keep in mind that the Online Delivery feature we offer is compatible
with the following web browsers:

--    Netscape Navigator 3.01 or higher (visit
http://www.netscape.com/download/index.html to upgrade)
--    Internet Explorer 3.02 or higher, on a machine running Windows 95 or
higher (visit http://www.microsoft.com/ie to upgrade)
--    AOL 3.0 for Windows 95, using Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.02 or
higher (visit http://www.aol.com to upgrade)

If you are using Netscape Navigator 3.0 or Internet Explorer 3.0 or higher,
your browser must accept the cookie our server sends before it will allow
you to view your report.  The cookie contains your membership and passcode
number information and acts as a special pass, allowing you to access
specific areas of our web site--in this case your credit report.  (Your
browser will automatically accept the cookie unless you specifically tell it
not to.)

If you are using AOL, you can confirm whether you have AOL 3.0 for Windows
95 by clicking on the "Help" link at the very top of the page, then clicking
on "About America Online."  You should then see a box that has the AOL logo
and the message, "America Online 3.0 for Windows 95."  This version of AOL
automatically comes with Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.02 or higher.

You will be able to view or download your credit report for 3 weeks after
the date at the top of the report. After that, your report will be deleted.
Remember to print or save your report before exiting it, so that you can
refer to it later.

If you have any questions, please call our CreditCheck Customer Service
Center toll-free at 1 (888) 888-8553.

Thank you,

Michael Gordon
