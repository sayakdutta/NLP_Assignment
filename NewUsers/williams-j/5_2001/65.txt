No, I told Sharon Probably.  I make sure Yes's never come out of my mouth.  I might just get locked in if I do.

 

Jason,

The following replied to my original e-mail:

- Ferg: Pretty sure, gotta check with my wife.
- Hatcher: I am up for playing.
- Scott: I might be.  I need to talk to Kathy about it first.
- Von: see you then
- Jason: no e-mail reply, but his assumed answer is, "I don't reply until
the very latest possible time so that I have an opportunity to look at all
of my options and chose the one that matches my interest that particular
day, hour, or minute." :-)  Actually, Jason told Sharon that he was in last
night, but he may change his mind after that dig.
- Mike: out
- Todd: out

We definitely have three (Von, Jason, and me).  If all of the maybes come
(Ferg, Hatcher, & Scott), we will have six.  Please confirm if you can make
it tonight.

Thanks,
- Bub
