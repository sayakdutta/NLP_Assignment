A customer in TX is looking for gas supply to two power plants.  We are looking for a gas daily fixed price straddle at Waha and Perm in order to give the customer flexibility.  Volumes, term and strike are shown in the file below.  Let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks,
 << File: Gas Daily Option  Offer.xls >>
