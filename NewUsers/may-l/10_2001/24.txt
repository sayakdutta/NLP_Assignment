Dr.Lockwood,

Due to a family crisis concerning my son's health I am requesting an extension on completing the mid-term exam for IN520 until  11/7/01.  I realize the deadline had already passed but between work and my son's condition I was delayed in sending this e-mail.  I appreciate any help you can provide in this extension.

Sincerely,

Lawrence J. May
