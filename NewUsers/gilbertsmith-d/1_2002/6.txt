no problem. Likewise, I would like to be kept in touch with what you guys are up to as well.

Thanks,

Doug --

Please do not send anything out to the PUC until my team has reviewed.

OK - Doug can have Smith Day and Jeff Miller work to get the retail certification.




We need to have everything in 30 days.  I know that.

The question is given everything else - FERC MBR, gas pipelines, PJM, etc. - isn't it better to move into ERCOT at the wholesale level and then come back after getting the rest of the market moving along?

From a resource standpoint, I need to understand how to get PUCT counsel for UBS to start the REP process anyway.

We need it w/in the first 30 days.




But do we need it immediately? Can we file later for retail authority?
