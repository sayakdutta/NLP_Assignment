I'm always hanging out...


of my pants!

That said, perhaps I can get more casual...
It's tough for me to get away for lunch, with my new gig, but
your companionship is the break that refreshes. We need 
some quality time.

Also, I've heard from Ellwanger, who is cleaning boats. He offered me
a raw, water washdown. And I don't own a boat.


 


hey are you there darlin?
