The game was nail-bitingly close, but Chinese 12 year old hookah's strategy of
ChoKoNu mayhem was the deciding factor.
At one point, Beth and I soaked the earth with the blood of wave after wave of paladin assault
(and rear-action monk cowards), but it was Alan's resource control that won out.
But for the most part, I would characterize the game as a draw.
Bring on the firstperson shooters until Star Wars.

Tis' true I did kick the game over in my head a bit last night, but alas I found calm in the words of jim rome "SCOREBOARD!". 
The team of zero tolerance, black jesus, and matt (couldn't really tell if he was playing never saw his army) was thoroughly trounced yet again. 12 yr old hooka and I were merciful however and accepted the early surrender of the brow-beaten losers.
Here's to hoping a bit of smack talk can bring forth a better effort next round :)

Let's gauge the interest in a first-person shooter: 
Through Allan, we have several at our disposal, and if we want to own them, there are a ton of great ones available at sub-basement prices.  However, let's try before we buy (if you haven't already).  Current options include Rogue Spear (very realistic and detailed), Quake (fragtastic), and Tribes (all about teamwork).  There are others, too, but these were the ones Allan and I were chatting about.
You folks wanna try this?

PS. Allan said he was awake all night thinking about how close we came to slaughtering him..or something to that affect.
