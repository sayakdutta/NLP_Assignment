I just got back from checking out the new building. It's sweet.

Jason,
I hope this is your e-mail address & that you get this message.  We hadn't heard from you in FOREVER, so I thought I'd see what you are up to.  I also have some Enron questions for you.  So, if you are still breathing, reply ASAP & I'll send you a long, juicy e-mail for your reading pleasure. =)
