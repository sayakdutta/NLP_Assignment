Thurs I can play after Thirtysomething...

but on a serious note, I need some clarification on when AoE lance night is taking place,
and when XBox night (Thurs?) is happening. I'll bring some Miller for MK
Jason

 


Just for Good Measure... 
Nobody is comparing dimensions with me...unless you wanna dredge up a new reason to hate your parents. 
So, have we got a full room for tomorrow? 
I'll work out the details with Trav and get back to you guys about HALO on Thursday--we might want to use two locations and play online if we can be sure of our ability to do that.  Otherwise, we'll all meet in one place to oooh and aaaah over HALO and booze.
 
I open my email, and Trav is inviting people over, threatening to pull 
out 
the ol' lance, and comparing dimensions with Matty. I guess that means 
it's game night. 
Is Allan going to around Tues? He has been notoriously absent, and may 
not be allowed to play anymore.
