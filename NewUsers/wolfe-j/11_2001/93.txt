Jonda, be a sport. No one expected YOU to get a T-shirt.
You and Beth were getting tube tops.


So was Matt.

 



I am not.  And I am not buying a tee shirt. White or baseball. And I am not
shaving anything into my mullet. Or getting a license plate. Travis,
neither are you.
Have fun though... Keep an eye out for Beth's towers.

Who is playing, and when should we start? Get back at me so I will know
when to show up.
Thanks,
DJ
