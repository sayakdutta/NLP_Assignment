Our two Portland traders also want to attend the same seminar as the Houston 
guys below.  Can you confirm that these reservations are OK so our two 
Portland traders can make plane reservations.

Much thanks!

Below are the training preferences for our three Houston traders.  If you 
could sign them up I'd appreciate it .  I'll let you know as soon as I hear 
from the two Portland lads.

Thanks for your help, it was fun chatting with you!
