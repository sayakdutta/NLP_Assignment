San Diego has applied for a Password Application and wants to trade 
financial.  Per them, they have already been trading financial off-line with 
us, and I check with the Confirm Desk and that statement is true, Craig 
Breslau has done financial trades with them (I thought they weren't allowed 
to trade financial?!).  Anyway, can we now open them up to trade financial?
