Those are negotiated changes.  The only was to tell what is a "Canadian" 
thing is by looking at the form.  It is color coded with different colors for 
different countries or other special legal issues.  I believe Canada is a 
purplely pink color in the form, the footnotes should tell you.

Tana, thanks for all your help.  On the marked copy you sent, are all 
negotiated items in "blue" or are those "Canadian changes"?  Just wanted to 
make sure I don't delete something I shouldn't.  Thanks.

Be careful using IMC Canada to prepare your draft from.  Even though we have 
chosen NY law, we had two Canadian companies entering into the IMC Canada 
agreement so there is language in the agreement that is Canadian specific, 
and it might be missing some required US language.  I have also attached a 
redlined draft reflecting the negotiated changes to the form since the form 
we first sent the form to the counterparty.   I have attached our current 
form of ISDA Schedule as a reference.  The Canadian changes will be color 
coded, so you can see them easily.

Also, please note:  there have been recent amendments to the CFTC Rules that 
have required certain changes to the swap reps, in particular there are no 
longer "eligible swap participants",  the current terminology is "eligible 
contract participant".  Please see Part 5(b) of the Schedule in particular.
