As as follow-up to my earlier email, it is now OK to immediately open the 
referenced counterparty back up to transact both sides of USphysical  power 
as we have received the necessary documentation evidencing their authority to 
trade power.

We need to act on Marcus's email immediately.  Ed, if you disagree, you need 
to talk to Marcus.

We can find no record that the above entity has filed market based rates with 
FERC as required by the Federal Power Act. Suggest that we notify them that 
we can find no record of any such filing and as a consequence of which will 
need to turn them off from the being able to sell on EOL, however they can 
continue to purchase and once they have made, or can demonstrate to us that 
they have made the requisite filing with FERC, we will open them up for sell 
transactions as well.
 
Regards,
 
Marcus
