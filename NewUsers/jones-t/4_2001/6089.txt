Tana - It has been some time since we have spoken/emailed/voice mailed ....  
How y'all doing? Things are good in Toronto now that winter is almost over.

Will you help me out with something?  I need to know if we are able to do a 
power swap under the ECT ISDA with National Bank of Canada.  I looked it up 
on the database and do not see any restrictions but I wanted to make sure.

See you in San Antonio.
