At Wendi's request, I have submitted a request to get you both edit access to 
the Financial Trading Agreement Database.  In the meantime, below is the icon 
that will allow you to have view access to everything but the comments.  I 
will let you know when your edit access is approved (at which time you will 
be able to input changes/comments, as well as be able to see comments).
