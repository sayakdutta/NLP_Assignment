Per Sara Shackleton, an attorney in the Swap Group, Doug Friedman was 
involved in the payment dispute that was the reason I didn't open them up for 
financial trading the first time they came around in January 2000.  Based on 
the email below, I will be opening them up on EOL to trade financial.

I did not see Sonoco on the attached document.  Nevertheless, we did resolve 
our dispute with them and have no issues on the trading desk with them 
outstanding.
