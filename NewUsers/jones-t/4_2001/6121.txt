marcus,

you've got to get this straight with Global Counterparty or you're going to 
have a bust on your trades.

This counterparty is not set up in GCP as an Agent, only as Alliant Energy 
Corporate Services, Inc.  We have no power contracts with this entity as set 
up in GCP or in the agency name.  There are deals in Enpower under the 
corporate name and they are confirmed under the GTC.


   
	
	
		


Rhonda or Melissa:
Please respond to me on approving the product, East PHy. Power under Alliant 
Energy Corporate Services, Inc., as Agent, so EOL can do their rush tomorrow.
Thanks:
