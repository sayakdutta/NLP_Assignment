Tana,

This has made the circle to me.  Did they say what kind of trade there is 
between Diashowa and NBC.  My expectation is a currency hedge.

I am guessing we would take assignment of the deal if we purchased the 
company who had this contract.  Do you know about it?  

 
Ngo, Tracy; Campbell, Lesli; Espinoza, Veronica; Radous, Paul; Lebrocq, 
Wendi; Diamond, Russell; Moran, Tom; Sacks, Edward; Mendoza, Nidia; Conwell, 
Wendy; Vanek, Darren; Johnson, Rudwell

I got a call from National Bank of Canada and they said that we purchased the 
referenced company and what did we intend to do with the trade between NBC 
and Daishowa?  Anyone know anything about this?
