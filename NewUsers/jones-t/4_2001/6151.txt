The First Amendment extended the term to April 30, 2001 and expires and the

If the enclosed meets with your approval, would you please execute the 
attached Second Amendment and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I 
will then have it executed by an officer of EnronOnline and return a copy to 
you via fax.  If you have any comments or questions please do not hesitate to
