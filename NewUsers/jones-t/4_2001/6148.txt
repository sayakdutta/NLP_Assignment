legal team around the world, and I just heard back from the final critical=

one.  We are OK with them trading the products below.  However, on physical=

power, they can only trade west power.  Stephanie, will you need to open th=

up so they can trade immediately?

the system?

PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF THERE WILL BE ANY PROBLEMS. =20

Thanks all!
