Strictly informational.  I need to know everytime we have a governmental 
entity, so since there was no note in the side that this was connected a 
governmental I had to research that.  I was sharing the information I 
gathered with you so as to save you some time in case you didn't already know 
this.  Obviously, you did.

My notes show that this is a governmental.  It is the utility for the Town of 
Colorado Springs, Colorado.
