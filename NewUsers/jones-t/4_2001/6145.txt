Hi Tana  5 is fine , but Nina has got me down for dinner with you on 
tues(Ist)?................What is a "Nickle" tour?.........Sounds 
interesting.  




I was just thinking, if you could get to my office a little earlier, say 5:00 
on Monday, I could take you on my "nickle" tour of Houston while it is still 
light outside, if you like?!
