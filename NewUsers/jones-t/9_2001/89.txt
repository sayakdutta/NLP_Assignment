Many thanks.  
As soon as I receive the document from Houston I will prepare a draft.

To answer your question, the ISDA will govern the transactions created by the parties.  There are various other terms and conditions on the website that govern issues such as privacy, the use of the website and the creation of transactions electronically.  If there are any particular provisions that cause you concern please let me know.

Tana I should be grateful if you could send the ISDA to me.
regards
Janet Wood
