I spoke to Norma at your store yesterday, and she said to send you an email to reserve a table.  I am with the Enron Legal Dept. and we would like to reserve a table for happy hour on Friday at 6:00 pm for 10 people.  We would like to have both wine and h'ors d'oeuvres.  If you need additional information, or if there are any problems, please call me at 713/853-3399.
