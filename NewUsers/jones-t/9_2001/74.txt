No, the last note I have is proving the revised NDA for you to send to them.  No word since then.

 

Tana:

Any contact from Citi on the NDA?

Thanks,

Mike






Mike,

I'll look look into our schedule and follow-up with legal on the NDA.  I
think my lawyer was going to follow up with your lawyer.  Speak to you soon.




Scott:

One thing I forgot to mention in the first note: how is the NDA coming
along?

Thanks,

Mike
