Who is Kevin Meredith?  I only review counterparty lists I receive from Credit.

 

The attached document is a list of counterparties that must be reviewed and approved by 2:00PM Friday.  All counterparties will have "read" access to the product, which is a Physical Turbine option, and the following list will have execute access.  Please contact me at 3-9555 or Karen O'Day at 5-4135 if you have questions.

Here is a list of 24 customers who are likely purchasers of the CGT option product.  It really doesn't matter if all of them get access, as long as the whole of EOL can see the product.  Credit can pick from amongst number of these counterparties for initial access.
