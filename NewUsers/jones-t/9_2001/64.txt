 

Tana,

Thank you for working with us to get the Mutual NDA expedited.  Our meeting
next Tuesday in Houston will be far more productive with both sides open to
discussing all the challenges ahead.

Attached is the agreement that Enron N.A. worked up with Organic the last
time we met. It is a departure from our standard form and did go through
numerous revisions before being executed.

I'm in town all week so please don't hesitate to call or email me direct.

Thanks again for your help,
Brandon.
