Whilst speaking to Koch about the Koch Hydrocarbons/Industries trades, they 
asked if they could get ISDA Masters in place with two other Koch entities we 
are currently trading with.  The two companies are:

Koch Petroleum Group L.P., Credit Contact at Koch is Arnold Lenz at (316) 
828-8479

Koch Refining International Pte Ltd. a Singapore company, Credit Contact is 
in Singapore and can be reached at  65 835 20 27 (I don't know if Houston 
Credit or London Credit wants to handle this, I looked in the Master Swap 
Agreement database and I noticed that London sent them a draft in 1999).

The Legal contact at Koch is in my database.  It is a paralegal there, Pam 
Reinking at (316) 828-4783.
