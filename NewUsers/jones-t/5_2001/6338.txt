It depends on the sophistication of the counterparty.  I think Tembec is 
fairly sophisticated based on the resolutions from them I have already seen.  
For a counterparty that isn't, we have sample board resolutions we can send 
them, or we even prepare them for some counterparties because sometimes they 
can't even figure out how to fill in the blanks.

Tana - thank you for your messages.  I will advise Jan and Randy that in 
order for Tembec to do gas transactions under this ISDA, they weill need to 
provide us with a board resolution authorizing the same.  Do counterparties'  
typically prepare their own resolutions or do we provide them with a 
precedent?

Thanks
