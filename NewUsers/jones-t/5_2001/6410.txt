Sorry, it was on the slow boat, in interroffice mail back from Steve, I just

Thanks.  Can you mail me when you get it?  If I don't hear from you by end of 
week, I'll call Steve.



 

No, I have not received the fully executed document yet from Steve.






Tana,

Just a follow up.  Did you happen to receive the above from Steve Hotte of 
ETS?  If so, has a copy been forwarded to Pan Handle Eastern Pipeline co?
