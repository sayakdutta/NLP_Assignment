Thanks for following up on that.  I got the counterparty to refax the 
document to us and Lorraine just got Andy to re-execute it.

Lorraine,

Update--I spoke with Marcos this morning, he said that he was never given a 
document by Andy on Friday to deliver to Tana.  We are all at a lost 
regarding the missing document.
