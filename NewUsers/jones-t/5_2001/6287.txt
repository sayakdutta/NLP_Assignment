Below is the ISDA in electronic format as you requested.  This draft is 
several years old and if you are putting a new one in place I would suggest 
you start from the newest version of the form and just use this to use as a 
blackline version.

Hello Tana,

I have spoken with the lawyer from Alcoa and she is fine with us viewing the 
ISDA in place. In fact we already have a copy but I need it in Electronic 
format. If you could send an electronic copy it woud be greatly appreciated.

Thanks

Ian
