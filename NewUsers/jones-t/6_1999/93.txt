Robert Quick. We call them our trader guidelines.

Mark said you would know who it is in London that prepared a "script" for 
your traders on what to say on the phone when transacting a deal.  Liz Sager 
is working on some training mid-next week for the power desk traders and 
needs to prepare a similar script for them.  If you could let me know who to 
contact I'd appreciate it.  Thanks for your help!
