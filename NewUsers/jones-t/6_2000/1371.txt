Stacy,

Jeff asked me to pass this on to you for handling:

Tom Nuelle (pronounced "Nelly"), Risk Manager at BP Amoco called, and said 
they need to assign a physical trade from one Amoco entity to another.  The 
trade was done w/Amoco Energy Trading and they need to assign it to Amoco 
Canada.  It's a Nov-March,EOL Deal no. 265080.  Tom's phone # is 
281/366-4034.  Tom Moran from Credit had no problem moving the trade.
