I know you are busy, but you need to send out your email about the signed 
master as soon as possible, so we can open up Utilicorp to trade financial.  
Brant can only open them up from Credit's perspective, I have to open them up 
from Legal, but they will still not be able to trade only until Global 
Contract ties the counterparty to the master, and they cannot do that until 
they get your email.  Thanks.
