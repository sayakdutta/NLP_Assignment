Attached is a list containing the new MG counterparties.  You can see it by 
clicking on the second tab at the bottom of the Excel spreadsheet  where it 
says "MG New Cpys".  Ignore the first tab.  I am told by London Legal that 
our deadline for responding to this list is Monday.  

Bandwidth team, in talking to London Legal, per my current understanding, the 
only two jurisdictions approved to trade bandwidth are the US and UK.  We've 
got Japan and Bermuda approved to trade US segment only.  So unless we hear 
otherwise from you, it is our intention to give all the other counterparties 
"read only" access.

Herewith revised approval list.  

Tana will revert with an update on US counterparties some of which will need 
to be switched to read-only.

Thanks,

Edmund
