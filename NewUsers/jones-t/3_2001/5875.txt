He can call any one of the attorneys in the Swap Group, Mary Cook does 
Canada, but she'll be out next week so it would have to be quick, or Sara 
Shackleton or Brent Hendry.

The legal counsel at Sempra would like to contact someone in our office 
regarding "perfecting monies" for Canadian counterparties when posting 
collateral.  Who should I have him call?

Please advise.
