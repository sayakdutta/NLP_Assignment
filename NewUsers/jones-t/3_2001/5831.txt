Yes, legal is OK with this.  Trades executed from the London desk will be 
arranged through EEFT; trades executed from the New York desk will not need 
to be.  In either case, the Enron principal to the transaction would be 
ECTRIC.

Everybody

It is my understanding that for we can use the single entity ECTRIC  for 
softs global trading(London and New York).

Please confirm that each of your respective departments is in agreement with 
this.


Thank you
