Attached is the proposed form of LOI.  Please let me know if it meets with 
your approval, and I will email it to the customer.  I kept the language in 
the term sheet in the back pretty broad as it references "energy 
commodities".  Your language re "US crude and products" wasn't clear to me.  
Perhaps you meant US crude and crude derivative/refined products?  Will 
energy commodities work, or do want to limit it to crude products and charge 
more for other products?

I need to get a Broker Client LOI for United Fuels

Price: $250 K
Products: US Crude and Products
Term: 1 year

I need this yesterday as I promised and didn't get it to him  ( I owe you big 
time, how about an EnronOnline yo-yo to repay you).  I know you are in Canada 
so can you coordinate with Mark Greenberg.  Please CC Dan Diamond on any 
correspondence with United. Thanks
