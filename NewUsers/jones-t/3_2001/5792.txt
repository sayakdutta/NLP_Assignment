Attached is a clean and a blacklined draft of the BETA.  This draft was 
created using the new BETA form, and the blackline compares this draft 
against the form.  I have also attached a blackline from the intial draft we 
sent counterparty to the draft we are sending counterparty now, in case you 
want to show them all the changes from that draft.  That blackline is called 
prebon.red below.
