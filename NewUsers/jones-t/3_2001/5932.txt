Thank you Swap Queen!!!!





I got your company number on my own, so now we just have to wait to have the 
erequest approved.  I hope it will be today.

Tana,

My cost centre code is 100336.

As to company number, I'm not sure what number you require, or where I can 
find it.  Any assistance you can give would be gratefully received.

Thanks, Edmund





In order to complete your access request, I need your company number and your
