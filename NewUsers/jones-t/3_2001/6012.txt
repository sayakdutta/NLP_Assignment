The Sabre NDA that you made revisions to has been passed on to me from
Gary Potter here at Sabre.  I have obtained comments back from our legal
department regarding changes that were made.  In the version you sent
back to us the supplement page and reference to it had been deleted. If
I can explain why we have structured our NDA's in this fashion.  If we
can get the basic NDA in place and agree on those terms, it is often
easier in the future to add a new supplement when ever the scope of the
conversations change.  This is helpful to save time in the future so
that other business units within Sabre do not have to negotiate terms
again.
I have made a few additional changes based on our attorneys request.
Please feel free to call me if needed, 817-931-4674.  If you accept the
changes made go ahead and sign the document and return it to me via fax
at 817-967-4756.
thanks
