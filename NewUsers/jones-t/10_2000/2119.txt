Tana, Sam and I are putting together a draft ISDA between ENA and an 
Australian bank -- I understand from Sara that you worked with her on a 
recent ISDA w/ James Hardie, another Australian bank.

It does not appear from the CP has delivered its legal opinion to us -- 
however, do you have a draft of legal opinion that Sam could use as a 
template?  if so, could you e-mail it to Sam?

We have been asked to get a draft out on a rush basis so any help you can 
provide in expediting this would be appreciated -- thanks, Bob
