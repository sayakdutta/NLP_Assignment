I have told EOL this counterparty is approved to trade Japanese products.  I 
just want to confirm with you, are they also approved to trade all the other 
products, physical and financial around the world?

Dear Tana,

This is a big company so in terms of general counter party approval they are 
fine.

I just got a call from the online team, and there is a rush push on from 
London to get this counterparty approved ASAP.  Since you are the key person, 
I thought I'd pull you into the loop.  This counterparty should be coming 
thru on tomorrow's approval list.  I know you've got to do your due 
diligence, so if you could let me know how long it will take to get back to 
me I can let the EOL and London people know.  Much thanks!

P.S.  I enjoyed chatting with you at the seminar!

As discussed, here is the name of the Japanese counterparty that will be on 
credit's next approval matrix.

Thanks.

Given the recent confusion on this counterparty and the push to have them 
approved - I will review Idemitsu today and have recommendations by late this 
afternoon.

Anna,

I just wanted to confirm with you that all fuel & liquids customers, 
including those from Singapore, are being handled by credit in Houston now 
that the responsibility for Global Products has moved from London to Houston. 
I spoke with Sheri Thomas & Tom Moran (Houston credit) this morning & they 
both agreed that these (Asia Pacific) counterparties should now be handled by 
Houston. However there still appears to be some confusion over this issue so 
I would appreciate it if you could send a reply confirming that this is the 
understanding at your end so as to avoid any further confusion.

Many thanks

Justin

I spoke with Frank Davis in Houston yesterday about this PA and he agreed 
that Houston PCG would ensure that this customer was reviewed in Houston and 
set up as soon as possible.  I have also confirmed with Frank and Amita 
Gosalia the situation with regards to responsibilities for Japan when 
processing PAs.  Japan has always been the responsibility of the Houston PCG 
except in the case of metals customers which are approved by credit and legal 
in London.

It would seem that this is an issue that needs to be discussed further 
between the London, Houston and Australia groups to establish responsibilites 
further. Hopefully this will ensure that this type of confusion does not 
occur again and delay the processing of a customer application.

Bo,

I put Idemitsu's PA into the database  for credit review on Sept 26 & it was 
picked up by John Suttle in Houston. I haven't heard anything since & seeing 
as they appear to be a fuel & oils customer I have today changed the RAC to 
London so that the PA can be processed over there, which is probably where it 
should have gone in the first place. I apologise for the delay and 
inconvenience however there was initially some confusion between myself & 
Houston as to where Asia Pacific fuel & oil customers should be processed.

Regards

Justin

Justin,

Idemitsu Kosan in Japan sent in a PA on 29 Sept to your office.

Bo Petersen of our Global Products team has been getting calls from them 
wanting to know the status of their PA as they are very anxious to get online.

The database says 'Credit Reviewing' - can you please feed back any comments 
or updates to Bo and the London PCG directly?  I will be out of the office on 
Monday and want to ensure that Bo knows what to tell the customer should they 
call again.

Thank you,
Lara
