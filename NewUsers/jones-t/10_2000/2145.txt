Per the attached, I think we will need to amend our board resolution(s) to 
add Cassandra as a signatory.  The ENA resolution appeared to have Ted 
specifically.

Mark, 

Per my conversation with Tana Jones, I am sending this request on behalf of 
Ted Murphy to change the primary signer for all documentation with respect to 
opening brokerage accounts and authorized trader lists to Cassandra Schultz.  
Cassandra recently joined the Market Risk Management Group (RAC) group as a 
VP.  

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call me.

Veronica for Ted Murphy
