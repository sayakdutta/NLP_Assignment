Tana,
Can you please have ENA, EPMI, and Enron Canada Corp. each sign a copy of the 
participant agreement attached below for the Intercontinental Exchange. When 
signed please return them the fax number listed and let me know when they 
have gone out. I got Mark Taylor's okay on this.
Let me know if you have any questions.
Andy
