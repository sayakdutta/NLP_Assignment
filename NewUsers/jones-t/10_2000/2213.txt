Dear Tana,

I was surprised to see that Idemitsu Kosan Co., Ltd. has not been approved 
for (did not apply for approval for I guess) any Japanese products; in which 
case I wonder why they are using the Japanese parent company and not a US or 
other sub.  As per email yesterday, fine for them to do EOL trading generally 
but could you just check that it is the Japanese entity which has been 
approved and that they will not be doing any Japanese products.

Thanks.
