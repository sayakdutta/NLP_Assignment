Good Morning Tana,

Thank you so much for faxing the ISDA with Utilicorp.  However would you be 
so kind to send the 1st 18 pages again.  They seem to have disappeared in our 
office.  I have everything after that (Schedule to the Master Agreement, 
Credit Support Annex, Paragraph 13 Annex, Exhibit A to Paragraph 13, and 
Exhibit A Guaranty)

I would greatly appreciate if you would fax the first 18 pages of the ISDA 
(footer states "ISDA 1992") to +47 23 10 25 50.

Thank you for your help.

Have a great day and weekend.
Sincerely,
Yumi Takei
