Tana, hope you're doing well.   

We'd wish to replicate the terms in the ENA-Utilicorp. United Inc. ISDA 
referred to below in a similar contract between ECTRIC and Utilicorp. United 
Inc.   Pls send me a electronic copy of the executed contract.  Tks.

Martin

Hi!

Thanks for your help.  According to Matt Dawson, it looks like a signed ISDA 
has been executed between ENA and Utilicorp United Inc. in the past.  We will 
also need an ISDA between ECTRIC and Utilicorp United Inc.  You mentioned 
perhaps mirroring the existing ISDA however with the restricted lists I 
believe you will be to obtain the copy easier than we will.  However, if you 
would like Utilicorp to produce a draft, let  me know and I can request that 
from the woman in the e.mail below. 

Please advise and I will pass the information on to Utilicorp.

Thank you
Yumi

Hi Yumi,

I did confirm with our weather desk that we will be transacting as Utilicorp
United Inc.  Sorry for the confusion!  How do you want to proceed on the
ISDA?

Thanks,
