I'm working with Mike Corbally's office to get the missing information on 
Reporting Service, Reporting Agency and Datasource for the European based 
weather confirmations.  As soon as I have that information available, I will 
plug it into the confirms and email the confirms to you.

Mark Taylor said someone there in London Legal was working on a list of 
approved jurisdictions for derivatives.  Is it ready yet?  Can I get a copy 
of it?  I need it to continue my work on the approved counterparty list.

Thanks!
