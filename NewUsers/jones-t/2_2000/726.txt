I have created a database for the Legal Dept., somewhat similar to how the 
master swap agreement database works, for us to keep track of our approvals 
for EOL trading, as well as any executed amendments to the EOL Password 
Application, ETA, GTC, or any other EOL documents.

I have been inputting the data for the Houston based Credit counterparties, 
and was wondering whether you want me to input the London based Credit 
counterparties or not.  I have no idea whether you've approved them or not, 
you'll have to input that data, or you could send it to me and I can input it 
for you.  Also, I don't know what counterparties you've had since the initial 
three big counterparty lists...But I know you are busy and it might be hard 
for you to find the time to input the initial counterparty data, unless you 
have an assistant do that.

Anyway, we (me, since I'm the one approving all new counterparties for every 
Legal Group in Houston!) have been using it and are finding it very 
helpful).  It is also helpful for when I'm out so Mark Taylor can look to see 
whether I've approved a counterparty or not and what rationale I had for the 
approval (usually I only put in info when I don't approve a counterparty).  
Anyway, the link to the database is attached, so why don't you take a look at 
it just to see what I'm doing.

We're still working on some of the sorts and inputting the data, so it's not 
fully operational yet.  Anyway, give me your thoughts...Don't make any 
changes, it'll screw things up...
