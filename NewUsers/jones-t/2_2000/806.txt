Greg,

It appears we send Dynegy Canada a draft ISDA in July of 1999, and got no 
response from them.  We will need to update the ISDA we sent them in July 
since our form has changed since then.  Once we get the go ahead from John 
Suttle in Credit as to whether we need to update the credit, we will prepare 
the ISDA Master Agreement you have requested.
