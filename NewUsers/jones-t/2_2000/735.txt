My Apartment:

1.  Fix leg on sunroom denim couch
2.  Fix front of dresser drawer in back bedroom that is falling off
3.  Front door - handle is loose
4.  The window in the back bedroom behind the bed is missing trim.  I think 
the trim is in the closet in the living room.  The blinds won't be right if 
we don't get that trim in.

Downstairs Apartment:

1.  Fix broken window in front bedroom
2.  In bathroom, piece of wood has fallen off cabinet
3.  In bathroom, towel rack is broken.  Can you replace?
4.  Peter says ice cube maker won't shut water off when is on, so he just had 
it off
5.  Nancy said front door handle is loose
6.  Do we have any drips in sinks?

The floor refinishers will show up Monday morning.  They are going to 
refinish downstairs floors and my back stairwell.

I would like to recarpet upstairs.  Where do you suggest I go to get new 
carpeting?
