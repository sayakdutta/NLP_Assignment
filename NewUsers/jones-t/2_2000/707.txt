Shari, how do you want to handle this?

The commercial person from BC Gas called me today to complain about the 
securities rep and warrant that we put in the confirm.  I thought I had 
resolved this by having you guys amend the ISDA and then we could remove it 
from the confirms.  She now tells me their position is that the rep and 
warrant was not pre-negotiated and was not in place at the time they entered 
the trades so they will not sign any confirms containing the rep & warrant 
and further they will only "consider" signing the amendment.  I tried my best 
to explain that there corporation could be harmed if they did not make the 
representation and she seemed to be making a big deal over a non-commercial 
point and she was the only counterparty to complain but I got nowhere.  Is it 
possible to send them amended confirms without the rep & warrant before we 
here back from them about the ISDA?  This would make them happy and get off 
my back.  Let me know.

Thanks

Doug
