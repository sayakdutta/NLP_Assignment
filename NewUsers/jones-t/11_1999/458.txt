If you've got the copies, why don't you save them as a form into your system 
and use them to draft the Caltex Certificates.  Send them over to Edmund with 
the ISDA Master Agreements.  Leave him a message asking him if he could help 
you get the agreements and the incumbency certificates signed, then have him 
send the certificates to me for Kate's signature.  I think that should do it.
