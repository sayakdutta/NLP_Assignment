Pam,

Per the email below, we will be terminating the transactions referenced below 
today.  Can you fax me the confirmations referenced in #1 below so I can make 
sure I have referenced them correctly.  Much thanks!

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL
SOLICITOR-CLIENT COMMUNICATION


Further to our conference call this evening, I confirm that Lavorato is quite 
keen to have the paper ready tomorrow for the termination of the BMO 
transactions to free up BMO credit availability with ECC and ECC's 
affiliates, which I can attend to.  

Before doing so, as I have had limited involvement to this point, I would 
appreciate if we could have a brief conference call respecting the 
documentation.  I understand the documentation should reflect the following:

1. termination by ENA of BMO transactions under ENA/BMO ISDA Master 
Agreement, transactions nos. N28388, N28977, N31021, N30817 and N32670;
2. termination payment from ENA to BMO of approximately Cdn. $10 million (to 
be confirmed);
3. termination payment is made by ENA on behalf of ECC (on what basis is to 
be confirmed, as transaction are between ENA and BMO); and
4. ECC repays ENA the termination payment pursuant to an inter-company 
transaction (on what basis is to be confirmed).

Regards, Peter
