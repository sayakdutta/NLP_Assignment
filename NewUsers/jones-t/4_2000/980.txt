We have received the executed Termination Agreement dated as of April 10, 
2000 terminating the referenced trade.  Per the request of Jennifer de 
Boisblanc Denny, this termination was prepared because the customer hit the 
same product twice on EOL and two exact transactions were entered into the 
system.  I will send the original (fax) down to Bob Bowen for handling.
