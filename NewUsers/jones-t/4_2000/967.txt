Attached please find the referenced lists.  I am not sending the list for 
4/5/00 because all of the counterparties on that list were Credit declines.  
I have responded for Australia Legal on the 4/7/00 list.  Remember, no credit 
derivatives approved unless specifically indicated (which none are).
