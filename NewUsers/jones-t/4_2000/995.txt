Per our conversation, attached is the form of Amendment to the ETA, revised 
to reflect your correct name.  Also, while I was revising the document, I 
added today's date, and the page number and footer reflecting the document 
name.

Call me again at (713) 853-399 if you have any more questions, otherwise, I 
will await your fax of the signed amendment and bring it to one of our 
officers for signature.
