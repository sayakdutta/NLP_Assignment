There is no change from my previous approvals for the only counterparty on 
the 3/30/00 list, so I am not sending that list.

On the list for 3/31/00, first, David Minns is in the Houston office today, 
so I gave the response today for the one Australian counterparty on this 
list.  We are meeting with Mark on Wednesday to try and figure out the 
approval process for Australia, so maybe after Wednesday I'll start 
responding for them.

Second, on this list please note that there are no counterparties that have 
been indicated as credit derivative counterparties, so none of the 
counterparties on this list should be approved to trade credit derivatives 
(even though I haven't "X'ed" them out).
