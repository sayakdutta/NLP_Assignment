Travis,
 
I looked in Mark Greenberg's office, and I did not find the agreements you were looking for, but I did find Mark's True Quote file there and in it are two executed amendments to the Price Posting Agreement.  We only have a draft of the original Price Posting Agreement in his file, no signed copy.




I am trying to locate the Enron Net Works/True Quote file (Equity Investment documents and Posting Agreement).  Please let me know if you have seen it or have a copy set of the documents.
