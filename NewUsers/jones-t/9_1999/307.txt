Taffy, can you check Grant's list against our list of executed masters for 
ECT Canada.  The Canada office is missing some of the masters we have in 
place, and we have to provide them copies.  See me and I'll show you how to 
do a sort on Lotus Notes to figure out what executed masters we show Canada 
has in place, vs. the masters they think they have in place.  Thanks!

Hi Tana, as per our conversation this morning here is list of counterparites 
that we think we have ISDAs with.

Please review and update at your convenience.  If there are any changes could 
you please edit the file and return it to me? 

 If there are counterparties that we indicate as having no ISDA, could you 
forward the appropriate documentation to Nella so that we have our files 
current.


Thank you very much.

Grant
