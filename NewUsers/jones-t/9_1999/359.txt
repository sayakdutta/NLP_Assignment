Tana,

ECT Houston can engage in commodity/weather derivatives trades direct with 
French counterparties, without having to use EEFT as the UK regulated 
arranger.  Put another way, whatever ECTRI can do from a regulatory 
perspective, the same applies to ECT Houston.  Please refer to the completed 
list that Edmund sent.

As for engaging in derivatives trades with utilities, this does not give rise 
to the issues as under US laws.  [In respect of new counterparties, standard 
due diligence as to corporate authority, etc will need to be done].

Hope all's well!

Per Mark's conversation, you were going to get back to us on the scoop on 
France and utility counterparties.  Any update?
