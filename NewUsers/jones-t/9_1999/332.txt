I'm a little confused.  Do I need to contact Gary Bode to (1) get Brent and 
the Buenos Aires legal team access to the current Lotus Master Swaps 
Database, or (2) get the software developed for Brent to copy the database to 
create a document tracking database for the Argentina legal contracts, or (3) 
both?
