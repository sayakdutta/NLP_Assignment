I'm working with Mark on approval of our counterparty lists for online 
trading.  Mark asked me to contact you about the approach we should take with 
respect to financial trading with Singapore counterparties.  Should Singapore 
be approved for all types of trading with all types of counterparties?  Are 
there are special counterparties we shouldn't approve for trading outside the 
governmentals, such as the utilites?  Are there any products that might not 
be approved for trading out of Singapore, such as weather, or any others?  
Are there any special types of reps we might need to include in our 
agreements?  Any guidance you could give us with this would be most 
appreciated!

How are you and the baby doing?  We hope to see pictures on your next trip 
over!
