Awais:


You should have received our market description from Shari this morning.  
Lynda asked me on Friday to add some more to the content, and the attached 
file has these changes.  If it is not too late, please use the attached file 
as our market descriptor.

Awais,

I think the weather description you are referring to was sent by an attorney 
in our group, Shari Stack.  If that is the one you are talking about, it 
should be okay.   I don't know the regulatory guys, but I'll try calling 
Steve Kean and see if I get a response.
