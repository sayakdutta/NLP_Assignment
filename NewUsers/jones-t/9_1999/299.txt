I just thought of one other thing we need to discuss with Credit in our 
meeting.  I've asked them to get back to me about this several times and 
haven't heard.

In the collateral annexes, we have interest on collateral computed at 360 
days.  So we don't have problems with Canadian counterparties, I would like 
to change that to 365/366 accross the board.  I asked them if there was any 
specific reason why we've got interest on collateral at 360, like maybe it's 
the custom in the bank/dealer markets.  Anyway, I'd like to get that 
answered.
