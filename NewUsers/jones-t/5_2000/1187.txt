You can take them off.  I spoke to Sara and Marie didn't want them to attend 
and that is fine with Sara.

Sara told me to put them on the list.  I've got a voice mail into her 
regarding same.

On another note, is there anything you need for tomorrow.  I sent the email 
saying the meeting was from 12 to 1:30 in 46C1 and lunch w/be provided.  Let 
me know if there's anything else you need.

The list looks OK except take off Clement Abrams and Ted Murphy.

Tana, please look at that list as soon as you can.  I'd like to get the email 
out today or tomorrow since we need rsvps for the food and drink.  Thanks, Suz
