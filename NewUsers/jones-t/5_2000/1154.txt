Attached please find referenced list.  A few notes:

No physical power or credit derivatives for any of these Japanese 
counterparties.  Re:  Bandwidth, as a general principle, what I'm hearing 
from the bandwidth lawyers is (1) for Japanese counterparties they can only 
trade the U.S. segment (which is currently the only segment we have online), 
and (2) for right now, we have 1 Netherlands and 2 German counterparties on 
the list, and they are still checking to get the scoop on those countries, so 
for right now I am shutting them down for bandwidth.
