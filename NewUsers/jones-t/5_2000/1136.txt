Attached is a list of Japanese counterparties.  I need to respond to 
EnronOnline Friday with my approvals to this list.  The list is broken up 
into 3 groups, Group 1 being counterparties already opened up for online 
trading (so you don't need to re-review), Group 2 being counterparties that 
we have correct names and credit on (you need to review this list which has 
about 100 counterparties), and Group 3 being counterparties that we have bad 
names or no approved credit yet ( so you don't need to approve this list).

You may ask, what products will these counterparties trade?  They can 
potentially trade all the products we offer online so you need to look at 
them like any new counterparty.  Saying that, what we really expect them to 
trade is the Singapore based group of products.

Frank,

Please call me so that we can go over this list before disbursing it to the 
other groups.




Thanks!
