Tanya,

Thanks for the info.  I'll amend the P&G status to include physical only 
until we hear something that makes us more comfortable trading financially.

We may want to rethink allowing P&G to trade on Clickpaper for financial 
business.  We have been trying to negotiate an ISDA with P&G for well over a 
year, to no avail.  While they are a great credit, they have issues with our 
no reliance clause in our documents which is a HUGE legal issue and they were 
involved in a large derivative lawsuit with Bankers Trust several years ago.  
This may be one for legal to decide, but my vote is against until there is an 
ISDA to confirm trades under.

Thanks,
Tanya
