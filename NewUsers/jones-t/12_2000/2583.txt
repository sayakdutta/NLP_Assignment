Tana,

Can Houston accomplish the below?  London is about to stop sending the Annex 
A (GTC) with their omnibus.  I think this would save a lot of fax headaches 
(and paper) on our end.  Let me know if it's ok and we'll set it up 
immediately.

Thanks,
Joe

Amita,

Justin has agreed that it would be OK to stop sending GTC's with confirms and 
instead include the following language on the confirms for EnronOnline 
transactions which are governed under GTC (not governed by Master Agreements):

"This Transaction is governed by the EnronOnline General Terms and 
Conditions. For a copy of this agreement, please click on the Product 
Description on the EnronOnline website and choose "View GTC".

Justin: Please verify that I have the language correct as per our discussion.

Thanks,

Dave
