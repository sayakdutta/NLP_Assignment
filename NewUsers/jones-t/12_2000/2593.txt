So far, I can probably leave on time today, which would be about 5:30 pm.  
Let's just check again as the end of the day gets closer.  I think it would 
be a good idea to meet there, since we're coming from opposite directions.  
Dinner sounds good to me....

Tana,

If you are still interested in doing the Williams Collection do, what would
be a good time for you to go.  We can meet there and then go to dinner.  Or,
you could come by my place and get a look again and help me pick out the
right furniture.  Whatever is convenient for you, please let me know.
