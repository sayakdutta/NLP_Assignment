As a follow-up to my email regarding the execution of the 12/29/00 ISDA 
Master Agreement between Deutsche Bank AG and Enron North America Corp., 
please be further advised:

Effective 6/4/99, Bankers Trust Company was acquired by Deutsche Bank AG.  
All financial trading should now be transacted under the above Deutsche Bank 
ISDA Master Agreement.  No further financial trading should be done in the 
name of Bankers Trust Company, and the 4/16/91 ISDA Interest Rate and 
Currency Exchange Agreement with Bankers Trust Company should be inactivated.

All outstanding Bankers Trust Company financial trades were assigned to 
Deutsche Bank AG in the ISDA Master Agreement, and all the Bankers Trust 
Company trades should be moved to Deutsche Bank.
