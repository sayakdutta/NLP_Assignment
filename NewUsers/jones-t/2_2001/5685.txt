FYI
While traveling in New York this weekend, Cheryl Nelson has become ill.  She 
is currently in New York, but is expected in the office tomorrow morning.  If 
you should need to contact her, I will be glad to do so for you.  Feel free 
to contact me at x5-3317, should you need my assistance.  Thank you for your 
attention to this matter.  Regards, Keegan
