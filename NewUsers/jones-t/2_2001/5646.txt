How did you decide to handle this?

Tana,

Tara and I are auditing the EOL bridge and noticed that the Phillip Allen / 
Reliant Energy deal from 11/28/00 is still unresolved.  Can you tell me what 
ever came about of that.  This is the transaction where Phillip mistakenly 
put the incorrect product on the web, Reliant hit on it, and then Phillip got 
out of the deal by talking to Reliant over the phone.  

Please update me on what happened.  I know it happened awhile ago......

Thanks,
Dawn

It is in Mark Taylor's hands.  Unfortunately, he is out sick

Tana,

Do you have any updates on the Reliant Energy deals that Phillip Allen did on 
EOL?  

Just wondering...

Dawn
