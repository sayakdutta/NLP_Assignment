I have a problem with the dates.  Saturday March 10th I planned to take you 
out to the Mountains (Banff/Lake Louise) and then we could have had dinner 
with my family at my house, or whatever, but Fiona points out that her 
closest friend is getting married Saturday the 10th and we are somehow 
integral to the process.  Can you change arrangements by a week or whatever?  
I hope it is not too late.

Peter.
