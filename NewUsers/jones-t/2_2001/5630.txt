Julie,

Just an FYI.

Depending on the type of contract, when I get them in I check them to make 
sure they have been correctly executed, and then, for the most part, I send 
the originals to Dave Samuels, who I have designated as the original file 
keeper for the non-trading related online documents.  I keep copies of the 
contracts here so we have a backup copy.

I am also working to put a database together so we can monitor what contract 
online we have.

Tana,
We just signed another contract with Arthur Andersen today for an audit on 
our EnronOnline price reports (this new copy is a long-term one similar to 
the short-term contract we had in December).  Mark Greenberg handled this 
contract, and Mark has the final signed copy.  

Mark was going to ask you who keeps the final copy, but I thought you were 
keeping them now!  Let me know when you get a chance.

Thanks Tana.
Julie
