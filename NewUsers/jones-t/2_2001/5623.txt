Attached hereto is a list of the agreements we reviewed in connection with 
the due diligence review that was done for Project Offline.  The list is a 
subset of the list you originally prepared with some additional comments 
added by me.  Could you please add in the Wise Soft agreements that I gave 
you earlier this week as well as the agreements relating to Robert Campbell.  
If you do not have copies of the Robert Campbell agreements let me know.  
Thanks for you help!!
