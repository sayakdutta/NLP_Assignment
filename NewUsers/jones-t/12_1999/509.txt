From the ENA Legal Emerging Markets Group's perspective, we see no issues 
with these counterparties. Mark mentioned to me that you will be collecting 
the Legal Dept.'s responses and forwarding our collective view to the Product 
Controls Group. Thanks.

We need URGENT feedback on these counterparties as their trading contacts 
within Enron have put the highest priority on them.  Credit has already 
provided us feedback on them.  Please respond to Frand Davis and myself ASAP.

Thank you and regards,
Rahil
