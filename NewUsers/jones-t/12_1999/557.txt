Further to concerns raised by Jim Fallon, we have acquired a list of 
counterparties who are licensed to trade power in the U.S. and will be 
restricting EnronOnline U.S. Power trading access to only those companies 
which hold a license.

If anyone has any objections to this, please let me know before we accomplish 
the update later today.

Thanks,

Dave
