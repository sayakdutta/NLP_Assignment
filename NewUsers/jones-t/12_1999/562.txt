With respect to the attached list, please note that for Credit's "amended" 
counterparties, there will be no change in our original approvals except as 
noted.  Also, I have not responded to the "declined" counterparties, so those 
noted as such are not approved for any products (I didn't want to go through 
and "X" out all the boxes).
