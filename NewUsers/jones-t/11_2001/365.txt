Edmund Cooper is the only person that has keyword access to add legal people, credit people, companies, or change other drop downs in the database.  I have key word access on this side of the Atlantic and Edmund has it there.  If you need London Credit people added that aren't listed already you need to have Edmund go add them, or the company as a new key word.

 

Hi Tana

I am putting on the Financial Trading Agreements database ISDAs that are currently under negotiation and have a couple of questions (sorry Matt is away today).

Where the Credit Contact is not listed under the arrows how do I add a new one? I have the same problem with an Enron entity - EFET LLC is not on there.

Hope you are surviving OK over there.

Regards
Anna
