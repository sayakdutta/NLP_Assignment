Attached is the First Amendment to License Agreement which extends the term 
of the contract to March 31, 2001.  My understanding is that you will be 
sending it directly to FT.  Once they have signed off on the form, let  me 
know and I will get Mark Greenberg to initial it and get it signed by an 
officer of EnronOnline.  Call me at x33399 if you have any questions or if I 
can be of further assistance.
