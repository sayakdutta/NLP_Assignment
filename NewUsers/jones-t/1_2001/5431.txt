Mark,

We finally got the information from Mr Hashimota.

Could you please give me a bilateral NDA by late morning or early 
midafternoon if at all possible?  I realize this is a hurry up and wait 
scenario and I apologize for  giving you such a short timeframe but I am 
working around the client.  

We will be discussing the figures for clickpaper and we will ask them 
information on who they sell too how much etc.

Should you have any questions please feel free to call me at 30559

Thanks.

Jake
