At the request of Mark Greenberg, I am attaching a clean and blacklined copy 
of the Amendment to the Electronic Trading Agreeement, marked to show changes 
from the amendment we executed with BP Exploration and Oil Inc.  If this 
amendment meets with your approval please let me know and I will start 
processing it for signature.  My number is (713) 853-3399.
