Attached below is a spreadsheet report of Bandwidth contracts in the Global 
Contracts database.  As we agreed, the Bandwidth group either has or will set 
up new EBS Contract numbers for each of these agreements, provide the new EBS 
Contract number for EOL Reporting, and provide specific notations and 
information regarding inactivation of the Global Contracts database records 
so that we don't have 2 "master" numbers for any given contract.   



I do not have edit access to Bandwidth contract records in Global and it is 
my understanding that the Bandwidth group no longer uses Global -- therefore 
none of us involved in this process will have appropriate security rights to 
inactivate the Global database records.  I will request appropriate security 
access to inactivate the records.  Then, when instructed via e-mail from a 
member of the Bandwidth team, I will inactivate the Global Contract database 
records.

Our agreement is that I will continue to report Bandwidth master contract 
information to EOL until Profile Manager is in production -- with the 
understanding from EOL that I cannot see the contract data reported for 
Bandwidth masters contracts.
