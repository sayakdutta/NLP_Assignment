CMS Marketing, Services and Trading Company is currently closed for US East 
Power Phy Fwd Firm (they were closed on January 9).  As there is no credit 
reason as to why we should close them from trading this product, could we 
please evaluate from a legal standpoint as to whether we could open them up 
for this product?  Thanks.
