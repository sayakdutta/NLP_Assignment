Tana, in light of your instructions that we not work on confirmations until 
"confirm training" is complete, I am asking you to help resolve a problem 
brought to my attention by Mara Alexander at Cargill re: a confirm.  I had 
not worked on the confirm so this is the first time I am hearing about the 
issue.

As per Mara's fax, a copy of which I am forwarding to you, a confirmation was 
sent on Jan. 12th for a trade done on the 11th.  Although there is an ISDA 
pending for Cargill-Alliant, the Confirm that was sent does not, according to 
Mara, reference the pending ISDA.

Please let me know if you can help resolve this.  I have meetings all 
afternoon, so if I am not around, leave me an email.
