We need to get the signed copy.

VWD is actually NOT an EnronOnline agreement so it's  important everyone 
realizes this. It was signed by Chris McKey , formerly head of Enron 
Frankfurt office and , presumably by VWD.  We are simply going to be using 
the existing agreement (which does not mention EnronOnline whatsoever), since 
it generically allows us to use their news on ANY  single Enron website we 
choose (does not restrict us).  As such is it necessary to have the copy 
signed by VWD ?  I would have thought that the important signature was the 
Enron signature since we are paying them for a service , not vice versa.

All other agreements related to EnronOnline this side of the Atlantic are 
pending (non-executed) to the best of my knowledge. 

 Michael - do you know of any other signed agreements that specifically 
relate to EnronOnline in Germany?  

The only other one that has possibly been signed is an agreement with a 
company called IMP that Nick Mooney arranged for some sort of outsourced 
direct marketing work for EnronOnline (suspect this is very small potatoes 
but will find out).   However, I'd suggest you contact Kal Shah - he may know 
about this agreement if it does in fact exist.





Is VWD the only agreement you have currently signed on that side of the 
Atlantic?
