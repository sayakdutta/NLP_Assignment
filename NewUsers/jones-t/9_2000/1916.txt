Attached is termination revised with Mary's changes.  Per Mary's conv. 
w/Fred, if the Counterparty failed to make payments hereunder, the contract 
would not be void ab initio, but instead, any payments to the counterparty 
would be offset against any amounts owing to us.

Tana,

Fred wanted to be very specific about the amounts due.  Can you have a look 
at the attached and let me know if it will fly?  See Brant's e-mail for 
numbers.

Thanks,
Joe
