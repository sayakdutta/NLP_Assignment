Tana,

Please review attached NDA.

Mark,

I guess that Reuters felt that we should proceed rather than use the current 
agreement.

This showed up while you were in London. Can you please get the NDA reviewed 
and signed.
Thanks.

Andy, Rob Garfield has asked me to pass along the attached NDA for your legal
folks to review.

Currently, I am working with Chris Behney of Enron in your Market Data Service
department on a NDA as well and is with the Enron legal folks at the moment.
The Reuters legal department has revised the NDA below which is in process 
with
respect to certain initiatives between Reuters and Enron in order for it to
cover the potential energy transactions venture Reuters and Enron are 
currently
discussing.  This document is blackline marked to show changes from the 8/15
version circulated by Natasha Wyss of the Reuters Legal Department.

I do not have access to the Enron legal person to forward this document.  If 
you
could obtain the name from Chris Behney and forward to him/her, we'd 
appreciate
it.

Thanks!
