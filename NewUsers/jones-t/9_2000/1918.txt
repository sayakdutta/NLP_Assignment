I should be available anytime this week, with the caveat, we have a big deal 
we're trying to close by Friday, and it could heat up at any moment.  How 
about tomorrow at 1:00 pm?

Tana,

I met with Mark Taylor two weeks ago to discuss legal's business requirements 
for the next generation Global Counterparty System.  He told me that you 
would be a better resource than he for counterparty issues.

Do you have time to meet with me this week for 30 minutes?  Attached is a 
list of questions I have about your needs in relation to the GCP system.

Please let me know what time you will be available and I'll setup a meeting.

Regards,

Corey Hollander
