Russell,

I spoke  to the cpy about this, and what it turned out he wanted was the 
Local Currency ISDA form.  I gave that redraft to Mary to sign off on the 
same day I wrote that note, but she's been too busy to look at it, and the 
file is now MIA from her office.  I'll check with her tomorrow and she what 
she did with it.

Samantha,
Tana,

I have attached an amended credit worksheet for the referenced counterparty.  
This amended worksheet includes a Guaranty from its parent company of $5MM, 
thus increasing the collateral threshold to $5MM, and amending other credit 
covenants.

Per the Legal Comment in the Master Swap Lotus Notes Database, Tana received 
a call from the counterparty requesting a 'less complicated' agreement.  In 
the comment, Tana suggested using an Industrial Master, if this agreement is 
OK from a Legal standpoint, I am OK using the Industrial from a Credit 
standpoint.  

Please draft this amended credit worksheet to an amended Industrial Master.  

Thank you,

Russell
