The list of trades was attached to the assignment.  Jeff Sorenson should have

I handle power financial transactions.  I wanted to make sure none of the 
deals assigned are power financial trades.

Thanks,

My assignment related only to financial transactions.  So it would not be 
power deals.

Hello, please let me know if any of these deals are power deals.  We may need 
to change them in the power system (Enpower).  Thank you,
Melissa
