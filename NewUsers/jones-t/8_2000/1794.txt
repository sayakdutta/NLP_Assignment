Are they approval for ALL products, or only Australian products?

Tana apologies. I check the list each morning and only respond if there is an 
issue. Both enitities are approved from a legal perspective. I have raised 
some questions Through EOL Product Control here as to why Straits Resources 
Ltd (a mining company) wants to trade power but they are legally competent to 
do so. 




I have two Australian counterparties on the referenced list, State 
Electricity Commission of Victoria and Straits Resources Limited, and I 
haven't heard from you, and I need to get that list out.  When you send your 
approval, can you be specific as to whether they are approval for Australian 
products only, or all products.  Thanks!
