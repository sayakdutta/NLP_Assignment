Can you provide Melissa with a copy of the recent assignment we entered 
into.  I think it should already be in the blue file.  Thanks.

Hello, for future notices Jeff Sorenson is not in my group and does not work 
with us.  They don't pass documents on to our group.  If their is a way that 
you all can tell if a particular document is related to power and can send me 
a copy if it is related to power that would be great.  There was an agreement 
with Puget Sound (an intermediate agreement until we get an ISDA signed) that 
was given to Jeff Sorenson's group and I never knew it existed.  Therefore I 
sent a confirm out incorrectly.  
Could you possibly ask one of the runners to bring me a copy of this 
assignment?  My location is 3116a.  I would appreciate it.  

Thanks alot,
Melissa

The list of trades was attached to the assignment.  Jeff Sorenson should have 
a copy down there.

I handle power financial transactions.  I wanted to make sure none of the 
deals assigned are power financial trades.

Thanks,

My assignment related only to financial transactions.  So it would not be 
power deals.

Hello, please let me know if any of these deals are power deals.  We may need 
to change them in the power system (Enpower).  Thank you,
Melissa
