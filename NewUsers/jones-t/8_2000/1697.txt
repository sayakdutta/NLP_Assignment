Justin,

I approved Powercor to trade before I left last night.  By copy of this email 
to our online team here, I will be notifying them of your concern that this 
counterparty is opened to trade when you arrive at work today in Australia.

Tana,

Thanks for waiting around this morning for David Minns. I'm not sure if you 
got to hear his message before you left however Powercor should now be good 
to go. I would really like to have them set up and trading by tomorrow 
morning Sydney time so I would appreciate it if you could send me the 
spreadsheet first chance you get.

Thanks for your help,

Justin
