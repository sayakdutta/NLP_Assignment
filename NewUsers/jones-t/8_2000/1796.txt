It looks like you will need to get whatever documentation Leslie had sign for 
those in place with these.  I know she has this problem with the service 
companies to the utilities.

I don't understand.  We were dealing with Ameren Services Company, who had 
been approved to trade online and they are the agent for Union Electric 
Company and Central Illinois Public Service.  Now they want to trade as 
another agent, for Union Electric and other affiliates.  Why are we not going 
to allow them to trade online?.  Leslie has approved them to trade over the 
counter under this name.

Thanks for this. Please consider "Ameren Energy, Inc. as agent" declined by 
Legal.

I just had this conv. w/Mark and Marcus Nettleton today about parties acting 
as agent, or in some fiduciary capacity online.  What I am being told is that 
the system is set up for parties to only act as principals for online 
trading.  It does not deal with agent, fiduciary or similar relationships.  
The only exception to this rule so far has been GPU where they had an agency 
relationship with 3 utilities, on the power side, where Leslie had some 
specific documentation that she got signed.  But I am told should not be 
entering into transactions with counterparties as anything other than 
principals, except under extraordinary circumstances.

Tana:

"Ameren Energy, Inc. as agent":  On hold til I speak with Leslie. I imagine 
they will need to sign our std. Consent & Acknowledgement form which allows 
them act as agent. It would be helpful to know for whom they are acting as 
agent. Do you know this?
