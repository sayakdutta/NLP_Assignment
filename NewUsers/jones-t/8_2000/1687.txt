1.  What is the heading styed "Derivatives Trading"?  I think that should be 
"Credit Derivatives".

2.  Move "Gas Trading" and "Emerging Markets Trading" to the end of the list, 
since I never have any responses from those groups.

3.  I need you to fix the boxes where I click for approved, "yes", "yes, with 
limitations", or "no", so I can unclick them if I click them by mistake.

4.  Like we have the sort for Houston or London, I need a sort for 
"EnronOnline" and "ClickPaper".  I will maintain my approvals for each of 
those separate online trading databases in the same database.

5.  I need a new category for "Pulp & Paper Financial".

Can you get these done ASAP, since I am sure by now you have gotten your rush 
from last week done....

As usual, your help is always appreciated!
