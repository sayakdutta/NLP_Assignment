Don't you remember at Sara's party, we were talking to Bill, and telling him 
how you were our favorite Credit person, and he said, "but I thought I was 
your favorite Credit person...", and since he is your boss, it seems quite 
political (for both you and me!) that he is always #1, anyway...a girl's 
always got to hedge her bets...!!

There's a reason why you earned the title of "Favorite Credit Person (after 
Bill)"...!
