I've been trying to get Clickpaper to expand their product approval list to 
match the products they offer...maybe your request will help!

Do we have a current PA approval spreadsheet with approvals for all product 
types available for trading?
If not, are legal and credit okay with continued use of the abbreviated 
spreadsheet attached?

Also, for EOL PA approvals Credit supplies the new counterparty addresses on 
the approval spreadsheet.  
Can we please implement this as part of the approval process for Clickpaper?
