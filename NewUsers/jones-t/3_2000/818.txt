Attached please find the referenced lists.  Please note:

Tampa Electric Company can do power sells only.  Even though Peoples Gas is a 
division of Tampa Electric, it cannot trade power because its power marketing 
license was not granted in that name.  Further, I earlier shut down Tampa 
Electric Company for financial trading, and I am now opening them up for 
financial trading, either as Tampa Electric or Peoples Gas.
