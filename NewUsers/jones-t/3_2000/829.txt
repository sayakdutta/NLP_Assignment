Per the note below from Brent, I am going to inactivate this master.  Also, 
per his note, it appears you should make a note to review the credit prior to 
approving any future trades.

I spoke to Gabriela and so long as there are no live trades we should just 
put this master on inactive status.  If the counterparty were ever to want to 
do another trade it would be conditioned upon obtaining another process 
agent.  Gabriela also feels that any further trading with the counterparty 
should be pursuant to another credit review since control of the company has 
changed hands.  Let me know if you have any further questions.  Thanks.





At our Group meeting this past week we discussed paying the consent to 
service of process ourselves, just so we can make sure it stays in place, 
since it's not such a large amount of money.  Sara Shackleton is heading down 
there next week and was going to discuss this with you...we just wanted to 
give you a head's up about our thinking on this.
