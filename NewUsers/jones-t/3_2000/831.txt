I don't know what list you are working from for your approval of credit 
derivatives, but attached is the list EOL sent me.  Many of the 
counterparties on the list are London based credit counterparties, and I will 
not be reviewing those, but I thought you might want to take a look at this 
to see if it's jiving with what you're looking at.  When I'm done (probably 
some time at end of the day since I just got the list yesterday and it's due 
today!), I will be emailing my approvals to Mark Dilworth in London.
