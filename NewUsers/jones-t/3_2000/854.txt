It appears you missed some cpys on the referenced list because Tom had the 
freeze panel button on, and you probably didn't see them at first.  I didn't 
either until I clicked on the down button and they popped up.  When you have 
a minute, I'll give me a call and I'll come around and show you how to 
unfreeze the panel.
