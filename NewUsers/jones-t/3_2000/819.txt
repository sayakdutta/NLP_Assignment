I am confirming my conversation with you yesterday and my conversation a 
minute ago with Lori Volpi at Dynegy Canada.  As we discussed, Dynegy Canada 
is trading with both ECC and ENA, with the bulk of its trading being done 
with ECC.  Instead of getting two ISDA Master Agreements in place, we will 
enter into an ISDA Master Agreement between ECC and Dynegy Canada, and then 
just back-to-back any ENA trades down to Houston by virtue of the Services 
Agreement for Financial Agreements we have in place between ECC and ENA.   
Per my conversation with Lori, this will also work with the EOL trades since 
the Electronic Trading Agreement provides that any financial trades done for 
either ECC or ENA will be transacted under the respective master agreement in 
place with either ECC or ENA.

Works for me...!
