The NYMEX has approved all of your applications and you should all have 
access to the system and be able to trade (everyone except Dana Davis, who 
still needs to complete his training).  Please let me know if you cannot log 
in.  I spoke to the NYMEX a minute ago and there is no reason from their 
perspective why you should not be able to log in.
