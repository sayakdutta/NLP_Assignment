I got a call today from Sterling Cook at Trans Alta in Calgary telling me that they merged with MEGA.  I'm passing this on to you for handling.  Sterling's ph: is 403/267-6991.  I also asked him to give us the phone number of their credit person so our credit person could talk to their credit person.  He mentioned sending us an amendment changing guaranties and thresholds, and I told him we would have to get that approved by Credit.
 


Please find attached our form of notice and amendment to the ISDA agreement
between MEGA and Enron North America (as successor to Enron Capital& Trade
Resources).   Let me know if you have any changes and we will forward
executed copies along with copies of the Merger Certificates.  THX

PS: Our credit person is Maureen Piercey 403-267-7987.
