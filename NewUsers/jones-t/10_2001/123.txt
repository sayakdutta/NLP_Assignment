There is a meeting of the Name/Change Merger Group Meeting on Monday at 1:00 pm in 49c4 to talk about timing of suspensions.  I don't know what, if any, relevance this will have for us, but since you do the name changes/mergers, I thought you might need to attend.  I wanted to forward you the email, but once I clicked yes, I will attend, it went away.
