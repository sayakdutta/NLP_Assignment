I just got a call from a dealmaker who is going to lunch today with a group of business people in from Russia and wants to get a Confidentiality Agreement in place before the meeting.  We have never looked at Russian law before, have you?  If you have, can you direct me as to whether Confidentiality Agreements are enforceable in Russian courts, should we include our standard arbitration provision and would such provision be enforceable, would we be better off getting the customer to submit to the jurisdiction of the NY courts, and lastly are there any other provisions we should be putting in the agreement.

Is there anyone there that can give me some quick help?  Attached is our standard form of NDA...Thanks!
