Anne Koehler & I had a quick call w/Doug Glass.  Thanks for his name.  We are going to include arbitration, though the ICC rules not our standard AAA (since we don't have the "Paris" language).  And NY law.  Otherwise, I'm just waiting on your FCPA language.  I also heard back from Justy.

Thanks for your help.  I really appreciate it!
