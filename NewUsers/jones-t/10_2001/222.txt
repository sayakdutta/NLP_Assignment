Attached is additional  correspondence from TransAlta re: the merger and guaranty info I sent you on 10/5/01.  Can you please contact TransAlta and let them know you will be handling this.  Thanks.
 

Tana,

I am following up on the issue for Maureen Piercey who is out of the
office.

Will the TransAlta guarantee provided to Enron North America for financial
deals be acceptable? TransAlta currently sleeves the financial deals
through Enron Canada, and TransAlta can not continue to do this due to the
administrative difficulties that are created by this process.

Please let me know if the guarantee attached below is acceptable, and if
Enron North America will be will to sign the ISDA amendment. If you want to
contact me directly, my number is 403-267-6992.

Thanks,
Geordie

Attached please find the form of Guarantee to be issued by TransAlta.  It
is the same form we issued to Enron for physical power transactions. If
