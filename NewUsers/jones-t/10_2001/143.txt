We are waiting for Mark Greenberg to finalize the negotiations on the amendment to the online ETA for DB.  We would like to shut down BT from all financial trading.  However, what we found was that DB will not execute the online ETA without some revisions.  Mark is negotiating an amendment to the ETA with DB.  Meanwhile, BT had already been trading online.  Since that cat was already out of the bag so to speak, DB didn't want to shut them down from trading without having another avenue to trade, so we are continuing to trade as BT.  We do not want to do this FOREVER, HOWEVER, so we do need to get BT SHUT DOWN.

HOW GOES IT MARK????
 

Howdy.  Can one of you guys remind me where we stand with this sort-of merged counterparty?
Last I recall while DB had bought BT, BT was still allowed to transact in its name - because we
hadn't yet renegotiated an ISDA for the combined entity.  Is that still where we stand?  

HELP!!!!
