I think yes.

 

Yes or No?
(You left one out!)
Phyllis will probably be there.





Running 12 miles was no problem.  Harry & I had a little "tiff" (I hope
only) this weekend, and as usual, he's out of town, so we haven't been able
to talk.  So who knows?

    
            
   Is that a 'yes' or a 'no'?

   What is up with Harry?

   Good for you on running 12 miles.  How did you feel?


   
            


   I would like to attend.  God knows if Harry can/will come.  We'll see.
   I
   did 12 (slow) miles last weekend...
       
                        
      Hey, Miss Tana,

      Patti
