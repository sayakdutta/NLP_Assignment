Justy, thanks for your quick response.  I heard back from Edmund too, and he gave me the name of a V&E lawyer he has used in London for Russian law and Anne Koehler and I gave him a quick call.  Doug Glass.   So we switched it to NY law and ICC arbitration rules and are giving it a go.  Thanks for your help!  I can't believe our business guy call 2 hours before a lunch meeting with a Russian company and think it's business as usual!

i would keep in the arbitration clause (this is better than submission to the courts).  i assume that the counterparty is a corporate or toher commercial enterprise, and that it will accept texas law?  if this is the case, what you have in the letter agreement should suffice.

I just got a call from a dealmaker who is going to lunch today with a group of business people in from Russia and wants to get a Confidentiality Agreement in place before the meeting.  We have never looked at Russian law before, have you?  If you have, can you direct me as to whether Confidentiality Agreements are enforceable in Russian courts, should we include our standard arbitration provision and would such provision be enforceable, would we be better off getting the customer to submit to the jurisdiction of the NY courts, and lastly are there any other provisions we should be putting in the agreement.

Is there anyone there that can give me some quick help?  Attached is our standard form of NDA...Thanks!
