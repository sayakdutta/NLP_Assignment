Please remember that once a master has been executed the status SHOULD NEVER be changed from its "executed" status.  To accomodate the master upgrades and master netting agreements I have added additional selections to the status bar, so you now have the following selections to choose within the "executed" status bar:

1.  "executed"
2.  "executed-under amendment" - to be used when we are amending a master
3.  "executed-inactive" - to be used when a master is executed but we are no longer trading under it
4.  "executed-master upgrade" - to be used when we are doing an ISDA replacement master or replacing one master with another master
5.  "executed-master netting agreement" - to be used when we have a master in place and we are upgrading it to add a master netting agreement

Thanks for your attention herewith.
