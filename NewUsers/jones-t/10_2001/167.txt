This counterparty has transact ability on European and Asian Metals.  They have hardly transacted at all, only power, much less any metals.  We figure they are using the website for price discovery.  If I do not hear back from you within 24 hours whether London Legal has done any due diligence on this counterparty's authority to transact metals, it is my intention to shut them down for all metals products.
