Mark Taylor is going the be the host of the next ECT Legal Conference to be 
held in the Woodlands in October and he asked me to contact you to see if you 
know yet which of the Brits are going to be attending because we need to 
start making reservations.  If you get a minute and can drop me a line I'd 
appreciate it.  Thanks!
