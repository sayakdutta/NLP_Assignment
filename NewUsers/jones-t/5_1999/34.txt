We are in the process of preparing applications for position limit exemptions 
for ECT's NYMEX energy commodity futures trading.  These applications require 
that ECT represent whether its officers, employees, owners, or agents have a 
power of attorney, control or have a financial interest in any other related 
commodity future account(s) either individually or acting with another person 
pursuant to express or implied agreement.

Please let me know by the end of business May 31, 1999 if you have any power 
of attorney, control or have a financial interest in any commodity futures 
account (other than an ECT account).

If you have any questions regarding this matter, please call me at (713) 
853-7459, or my paralegal, Tana Jones at (713) 853-3399.

IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A COMMODITY FUTURES ACCOUNT, YOU DO NOT NEED TO RESPOND TO 
THIS REQUEST.
