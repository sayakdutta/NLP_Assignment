Per Bill's email, I faxed a proposed form of Enron Corp. Guaranty to the 
counterparty.  Please do not approve any trades with this counterparty until 
due diligence is done on Italian law, which appears the be the place of 
incorporation of the counterparty.  I will not assign the review of Italian 
law to an attorney until we receive your credit worksheet.  If you feel we 
need to proceed with this now let me know and I will get someone to start 
looking at it.
