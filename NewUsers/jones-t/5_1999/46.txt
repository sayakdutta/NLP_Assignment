I did see the IPI presentation and was pretty impressed.  The presentation 
was, obviously, more directed to the confirmation process, but I thought it 
could also help in the creation and management of master swap agreements and 
swap agreement form templates.  I need to talk to our confirm desk people to 
see what issues of concern they had in the confirm process that they were 
hoping this system could address.   They had one concept for form generation 
I think is central for the creation of confirmations and agreements.  The 
concept was this "data dictionary".  It made it all clear to me.

I spoke to them about the different areas of concern in my database asked 
them to prepare another presentation more focused on those issues and come 
back to us before I leave for Europe in June.
