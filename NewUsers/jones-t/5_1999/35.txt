That may not be so easy an answer.  I think we would have to talk to 
Utilicorp.'s lawyers.  I  wouldn't be surprised that they had some policy or 
laws that won't allow them to guaranty the obligations of other companies.  
Utilities in the U.S. are odd birds, there are a lot of Chinese walls in 
effect with them, I've dealt with similar issues on other utilities.  If you 
need us to talk to them get me the name and phone number of a contact and 
we'll give them a call.
