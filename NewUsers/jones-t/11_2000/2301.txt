My last notes on Denmark from Edmund were due diligence pending.  What's the 
scoop on commodity derivatives, weather derivatives, credit derivatives, 
derivatives in general.  Any restrictions on any other products?

Thanks for your voicemail re:  Enron Metals.  I'll give you a call in the 
morning when I get in.

I miss my Justy...
