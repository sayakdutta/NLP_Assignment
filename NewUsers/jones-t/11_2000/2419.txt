Can you check on the name of RAG American Coal Sales Company.  We have a note 
in our Financial Trading Agreement database that pursuant to a Certificate of 
Amendment filed with the Delaware Secretary of State, RAG American Coal Sales 
Company further changed its name to RAG Coal Sales of America, Inc. on 
4/6/2000.  Our file is missing so I cannot find the hard copy of the name 
change.  Thanks.
