Can you email me your form?  How about lunch today?

Tana,

It appears that the Exodus NDA was done out of the Portland office and we 
don't have access to their directories.  It does look like our form, so you 
can probably use it as your starting point.

We, at EBS, are sorry for this inconvenience.
