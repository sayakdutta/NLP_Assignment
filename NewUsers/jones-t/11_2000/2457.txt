Per Mark's request, can we rename the headings on two charts with our gross 
numbers to match my list:  "Net long or short position in all months 
combined" should be the net of our aggregate position, and "Gross Long or 
Short Position" should be our gross position on either side of the market, 
with the positions not netted out.
