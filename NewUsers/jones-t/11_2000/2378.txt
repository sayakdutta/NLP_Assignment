We have a really old agreement with the referenced counterparty and I don't 
think we use it to trade under anymore.  I spoke to the Confirm Desk and it 
appears all of our trading is under Dynegy Marketing and Trade.  If you 
concur, I would like to inactive that master, since I'm afraid it might get 
attached for online trading.
