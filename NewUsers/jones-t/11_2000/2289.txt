Nony has the Mexico file.  If it's anywhere it should be there.

I have retrieved Carol's EOL Mexico file but Mark tells me that he did some 
follow up work with Mexican counsel and that you may have the results of 
that.  Do you have anything?
Thanks,
Brent

Justin has never dealt with a Mexican company for Enrononline therefore could 
you please give us  some advice on due dilligence done in Mexico. Justin 
needs to review this client for metals.  Thank you.
