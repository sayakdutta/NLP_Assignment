I still need to get the following prior guaranty returned to the 
counterparty.   If you are not going to locate this, I need to know because I 
am going to have to problem solve this with the counterparty.

1.  Guaranty dated as of February 10, 1998 by PG&E Corporation in favor of 
Enron Power Marketing  (this would have covered physical power, not 
financial).

I received the original PG&E Energy Trading Corporation guaranty in favor of 
ECT Canada dated as of March 11, 1997 from the Calgary office, so that one is 
taken care of.
