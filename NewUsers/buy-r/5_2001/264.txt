No interest in participating. As you can imagine Enron gets a large number of similar requests and I have adopted a policy of not cooperating, purely from a time management standpoint. Sorry, Rick Buy

 

Dear Mr Buy,

I have tried on a number of occasions to get hold of you by telephone, but
have now been advised by one of your colleagues to send an email instead.

Briefly, I work for a company here in London called RK Analytics which
undertakes consulting projects for clients in the financial arena.

In this instance, my client is a major player in commodity-related risk
management products.  My client is hoping to determine how it can better
improve the service it offers to entities such as Enron, and in order to do
this it has commissioned my services to conduct interviews with a number of
its clients (or potential clients).

To date, we've been lucky enough to have the cooperation of everyone we've
approached and I was therefore hoping that you yourself might be prepared to
answer some questions for me (bearing in mind that your answers would be
treated in confidence).

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you require any further information.
Otherwise, I attach herewith a questionnaire and would be most grateful if
we could find an opportunity to discuss this further over the next days.

I appreciate your time and consideration,

Kind regards,

Naomi Driver
