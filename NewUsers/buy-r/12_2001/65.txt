Yes- There are no deals to review and I don't attend board meetings anymore. Please get me off. Call me if you need more details. Tx Rick

 

Rick:  We can and will if the facts support it---have your title, duties and  responsibilities changed in light of the developments of the last several weeks?    Thanks, Rex

 

I completely agree. Please take me off this list. Thanks, Rick

 

Paula and Rex - I have mentioned this several times in the past several weeks, but have not received an answer.  Isn't it time to significantly adjust our 16b list?  There is clearly a new management team making the key decisions, and with all of the frequent Board meetings, it should be easy to do.  Thanks.  MEK
