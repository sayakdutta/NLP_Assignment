Bill- there is no issue with the garage as yet. Subsidy is still in place and bills are being paid per Steve Kean and Steve Woods. If you want to move to new garage it probably can be arranged. Let me know and I can get the person to get it started for you and anyone else. I think there is plenty of parking available. Rick
