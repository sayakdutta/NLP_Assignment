RICK:

    Thanks for your note and staying in touch during a time when a huminata=
rian crises could easily spiral into something  where the worste news is ye=
t to come.   Here is what Ive found out...
=20
    NYMEX has contingencies (which they are yet to exercise) for back-up cl=
earing, as well as a back-up site for open outcry trading.  In the past, th=
e first contingency has been exercised several times and is proven, though =
the later has never been tested in practice.  Meanwhile, clearinghouse paym=
ents have been delayed as a result of the NYMEX closing and the exchange is=
 likely to remain closed through the balance of the week (thus eliminating =
the need for daily payments).  During this time the exchange is closed, an =
effort is to be made to trigger one or both of the contingencies above (bas=
ed on yet to be clarified damage assessments).  The fact that some degree o=
f transaction data integrity exists suggests that long-term payment perform=
ance from NYMEX is not likely to be a problem.  However, if clearing paymen=
t delays extend past the end of the month when swaps settle, then we may se=
e delayed payments from weaker credits in related swap and physical markets=
.  In this regard, the markets have breathing room since the terrorist atta=
cks didnt occur late in the month.  Finally, there have been general commen=
ts from Treasury and Fed Bank officials to guarantee stock exchange payment=
s, and the assumption is that the same guarantees would apply to the NY com=
modity exchanges (but this asumption has not been validated or addressed di=
rectly in public comments).  Hope this helps.  Brad.




Was out of town but back now. I asked my group to look at your note and app=
rise me. Will let you know when they do. Tx Rick

        In light of recent events at the world trade center, Im concerned a=
bout the poitential for a systemic failure following the destruction of NYM=
EX. A quick note from you to confirm or deny would be appreciated.

        For example, if NYMEX payments are delayed significantly, Im worrie=
d that a larger payment failure in the energy derivatives market might foll=
ow.  In this scenario, Enron?s large NYMEX position could put it in jeoprar=
dy.  As a result, I would think you would know before others if a NYMEX cle=
aring falure is in the works.  Do you have any insight at this time into NY=
MEX payment performance?????
