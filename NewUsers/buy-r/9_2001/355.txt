I get snail mail and file the statements. You should too.  You can view your account online, with a password, but keep getting written confirmations and statements. You never know if a plane might crash into their computers. Love, Dad (A time will come when you don't need paper but I don't think we are there yet.)




I got this from fidelity today.  Do you think I should do online banking instead of receiving stuff in the mail?  What do you do?  Cheers big ears. 

Love,
