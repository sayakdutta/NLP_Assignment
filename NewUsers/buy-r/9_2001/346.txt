fyi- is nymex in world trade bldg? rick





Rick: 
        In light of recent events at the world trade center, Im concerned about the poitential for a systemic failure following the destruction of NYMEX. A quick note from you to confirm or deny would be appreciated.

        For example, if NYMEX payments are delayed significantly, Im worried that a larger payment failure in the energy derivatives market might follow.  In this scenario, Enron?s large NYMEX position could put it in jeoprardy.  As a result, I would think you would know before others if a NYMEX clearing falure is in the works.  Do you have any insight at this time into NYMEX payment performance?????
