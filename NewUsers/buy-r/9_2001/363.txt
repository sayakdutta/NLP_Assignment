agree- there should be no issue whatsoever getting him promoted at ye rick

 

rick,
David's review should be in his file in Houston, but, if not, I should be able to retrieve it.    Generally, I believe he has done a good job.  I continued to emphasize that he had to find avenues to use his technical strenght to influence the firm's behaviour rather than expecting it to be enough to be right. and that he needed to proactively communicate with other groups, like ops and commercial, with an eye toward empathy for their stance on contentious issues. 
I also said that he continues to be a viable candidate for promotion at year end.
Thoughts?
Ted 

 

Ted- Did you do David's performance review? Rick
