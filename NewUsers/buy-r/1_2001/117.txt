Rick, our plans are to stay on 28 until we move across the street when the 
building opens (July?). Thanks.


 

Are your plans to stay on 28? We are doing some planning on office space. I 
have some people in 3 Allen that I would like to move over here but it is not 
a big issue. I had heard that you were moving. Tx Rick
