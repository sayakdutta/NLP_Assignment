As mentioned in our floor meeting recently, attached are listings of teams =
that we are forming to better address the business needs of Enron as it exp=
ands both in volume and scope. Supervisors of each RAC sub group provided t=
he names for the groups with the understanding that they may have to be adj=
usted from time to time. Only the more senior people were included, but oth=
ers will be included as appropriate. Many will have to be multidimensional.=
 There will be no formal leader of the teams because each member is respons=
ible for the activities of the team, regardless of the RAC group that you a=
re in. Following are several thoughts concerning this process for considera=
tion.

-=09The purpose of this exercise is to better serve the customer, the comme=
rcial business units and achieve this within our control framework.
-=09Ancillary benefits include cross training of RAC employees and heighten=
ed awareness of RAC issues. "De-silo-ization" .
-=09All existing reporting relationships remain unchanged, for the moment.
-=09Successful implementation of this effort will require a positive attitu=
de among the teams.
-=09Existing RAC responsibilities remain in effect.
- =09Teams should meet weekly, at least, to discuss issues. Transactions wi=
ll require more frequent informal meetings.
-=09There are no excuses for forgetting to consider the impact on a deal of=
 credit, market risk or our portfolio.
-=09All team members are responsible for all aspects of a transaction. Offe=
r to help out if needed.
-=09If formal cross-training is necessary, force it to happen.
-=09Encourage weak links in team to perform.
-=09Each quarter RAC management will conduct portfolio reviews of the busin=
ess unit with the team present. This may take one quarter to implement.
-=09If it makes sense to sit together for logistical reasons try to arrange=
 it with your supervisor.
-=09Individual performance on the teams will be strongly considered in the =
PRC and compensation processes.

The existing EES team has been quite successful and in large part was a cat=
alyst to the recent reorganization there. You can have an impact.

This process should begin immediately.=20

Thanks in advance for your cooperation in this effort.
