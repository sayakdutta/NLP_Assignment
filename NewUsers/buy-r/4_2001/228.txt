We have received a request to change UK power limit from $12.6MM VAR to $35MM. Quite sizeable but I spoke with Richard Lewis and he seemed convinced it was necessary. Do you guys agree? What if it were $20MM? Skilling will definitely ask why such a large increase so I need to have your full support. Rick
