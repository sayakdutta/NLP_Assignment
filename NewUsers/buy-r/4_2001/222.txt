thanks for checking- it is unusual that they post interest daily. rick

 

Mr. Buy,

Just wanted to get back with you to confirm that the income fund that you are invested in has earnings applied on a daily basis.  Attached is a transaction summary that reveals that the interest credited between 2/7/01 and 3/31/01 totals $6,080.71.

 << File: Buy Transaction Summary.xls >> 

Interest rate for the 1st QTR was approx. 1.59%.  On a prorata basis the interest recorded appears to be reasonable.  I would be happy to secure additional information from the recordkeeper concerning daily earnings on your account.  Please let me know if this additional information would be meaningful.

Have a great day!

Kim Bolton
