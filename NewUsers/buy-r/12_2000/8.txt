Just met w/ Skilling and Whalley. 

Var for gas has temp increase of $15MM until next friday (12/15/2000).
Jeff is calling for an executive comm mtg to ask for an additional $40 MM of 
corp var until next wed (12/13/2000).

One issue is UK power will be over VAR everyday starting probably thurs or 
fri of this week, unless we increase them as well. (They sweep retail deals 
into book once a week on this day). This increase only needs to be $2-3- 
million.

Fasten seat belts and apply oxygen masks.
