Rick,

I have been attending these, but as a temporary replacement for you--I was just checking to see if you wanted to make this permanent.

Dave

 

yes, assuming you don't have an objection. i thought you were attending these meetings already but there are so many of them i get confused. rick

 

Rick,

Do you want to designate me as the RAC representative for this task force so that this comes directly to me?  Just let me know.

Regards,

Dave

Attached are the minutes from the February 6 Corporate Responsibility Task Force meeting.   Also attached is a chart outlining in more detail the metrics for success for each subcommittee.  The second document is the result of a meeting among subcommittee chairs and other interested task force members to help flesh out their purpose as a step toward developing a measurable work plan.

Let me know if you have questions or comments.  If you have not been contacted already, you will be hearing from your subcommittee chairs shortly regarding your next subcommittee meeting.  We also plan to set the date of the next overall task force meeting within the next couple of weeks.
