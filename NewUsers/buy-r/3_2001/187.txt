Rick,

Both Tanya and David Port are out of the office today and neither will be able to call in.  In speaking with Tanya this morning, she would like to report on her discussions with Jim Fallon and the EBS Team in London when she returns on Monday.

Given that two key team members are out-of-pocket, I recommend we postpone the RAC EBS Team Meeting until Monday afternoon.

Please let me know if you have any objections or conflicts and I'll confirm or reschedule, as appropriate.

Thanks,

Chip
