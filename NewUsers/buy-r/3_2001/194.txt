The names on this list seem very expensive to me. Do we really need this council? Rick Buy

As we discussed at the last Corporate Responsibility task force meeting, one activity that we have underway is recruiting an external advisory council.  This council will be comprised of global experts on environmental and social issues, from non-governmental organizations and potentially other businesses, to advise us on trends and issues in this area.  An outline of the advisory council structure, along with categories of experts and proposed names is attached below.

We expect to convene meetings with this group twice a year, inviting the Enron executive committee and board of directors, as well as the Corporate Responsibility task force, to engage in a dialogue.  We plan to present a slate of possible candidates to Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling later this month, and would appreciate your input and any ideas by March 16.

Thanks for your consideration.
