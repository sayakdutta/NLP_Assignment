I'm in. Maybe we could form a committee so Mark could be on it. He could even chair it if he was up to it. Regards,

Rick Buy

Executive Vice President
Chief Risk Officer and member of VP PRC Committee
Enron Corp.

 


Dinner is now scheduled at Pappas Steakhouse, Monday, March 26, at 7pm for all of those on one of the new committees and Mark Koenig.  Attendance is mandatory.

Regards,
