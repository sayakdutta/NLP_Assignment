Thanks for note. I may need your help here as I won't be able to filter stuff as much as I usually do so if my guys are reviewing something that looks way off let me know. 

Also, spoke with Pug re joint meeting and he nthinks we need 2 hours for it and probably won't be able to discuss international assets and lessons learned this time around.Is there anyway we can increase time for joint meeting to 2 hours, and have audit and finance as well? Pug really wants to leave adequate time to discuss limits etc. He also wants to be sure that all BOD feel they are invited. How do we do that? Rick

 

Sorry to hear the news but it sounds like everything is going much better.  Please let me know if there is anything I can do to help out in your absence.  I could spend more time on the Finance Committee book if it would help.  I'm just writing minutes and reviewing presentations for the next Board meeting (boring!).  Take care, Rebecca
