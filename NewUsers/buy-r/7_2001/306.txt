Tx, Rick

 

Rick:  Sorry about your setback.  I want to reassure you that everything is under control here.  The material for the Finance Committee book is nearly complete.  Stephanie is working with Cassandra and the Market Risk group over the weekend to pull together their slides for the joint meeting. We will make sure that everything stays coordinated and on schedule.  So the message is RELAX AND GET HEALED UP!!   If there is anything else that you are concerned about, I will be more that glad to tackle it.    Rick C.
