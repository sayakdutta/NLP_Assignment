OK but this is a tree and I want to focus on the forest. A few facts on this may be helpful to understand the forest. Also, be sure to coordinate with Ted on London stuff. Tx Rick

David and Rick,

I am following up with people in London to gain a better understanding of the cause of this operational loss.  I have been assured that several process changes have been implemented to correct the underlying problem, but I will also get enough additional details to make my own assessment.  

Thanks,
Wanda
