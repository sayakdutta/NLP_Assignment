Looks great. Is it a fraternity or sorority. Love, Dad PS Mom is home.




I'm attaching the final copy of my resume, already critiqued by my advisor and ready to be sent to companies.  See what you think when you get a second.  I added a few projects and computer skills and changed a few classes.  Hope you're having a good day at work. 

Cheers loser,
