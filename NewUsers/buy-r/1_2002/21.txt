It has been unreal. Would like to catch up. I may need a job! Looks like UBS has bought our trading operation which includes me for the moment anyway. Hope all is well on your end. Rick

Been following the Enron story as everyone else.  I am sure that is another 
side to it.  Hope things are going OK for you.  Lets catch up when things 
calm down.
