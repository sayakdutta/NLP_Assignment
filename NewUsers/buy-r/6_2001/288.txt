Just between you and I, I think there may be an issue here of a couple personalities. We can't have that in your group or mine. I'll watch carefully.

On the subject of timing, we should probably have a standard to shoot for. Time to read contract, run model, review results and communicate. I'll talk to Bill about this.

On the issue of the hotline, we do not have everyone trained in running models for EES deals. We are working on getting more people up to speed. Thanks,  Rick

Hey guys, I know we're all drinking from a firehouse here, but we've got to figure out how to streamline some of our processes.  I hear it's still taking way too long to get our credit reserve numbers (i.e.- IBM- 2 1/2 days) and it really is effecting our dealflow. People know about the credit hot line # but the consistent response is that the individuals that pick up this # are of varying experience levels and they still have to clear everything through Denise anyway. Please help me on this.

Also, we have to verify our process around incorporating an evaluation on an accounts receivable (late payment) for a customer when doing a credit check. Who is responsible for this now and how does this work within ENA for example?

Let's talk on Monday. Thanks.
