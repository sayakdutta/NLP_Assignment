Someone from Rick Buy's Risk Management group will be calling you to schedule a visit to discuss with your team the procedures and strategy PGE has in place to manage the variability of our net variable power costs.  Since Rick's group is  a corporate Risk Management group there should be no market affiliate issues.  The visit will enable us Houstonians to get even a better handle on the risk profile of your business given the tremendous volatility we have experienced in power prices.

Let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks in advance for your cooperation.
