I spoke to Rebeka this morning regarding that administrative position.  I'm 
not quite sure how it went but I want to thank you for speaking to her on my 
behalf.  Although she is looking to fill this position within the next two 
weeks, she mentioned that if this didn't work out for me that she would 
forward my resume to the HR Recruiter, Dianne White.  And if I may ask,  just 
keep me in your prayers.  Thanks again.
