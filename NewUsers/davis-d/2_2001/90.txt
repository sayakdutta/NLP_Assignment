We had a last minute going away lucheon for one of the accountants that's 
leaving the group.  Right after that another lady in the group is getting 
married next week (I think) so we gave her a wedding shower.  Sorry that I 
had to cancel and that it took so long for me to get back with you.  I been 
over here working my tail off too.
