Hey Joe!  Fat Chance about you being kicked off the anniversary committee 
cause if you go, I GO!  

Not very many people showed up for the meeting.  Grace, Pastor, Kevin, 
Carolyn, Mother Jackson and I were there. Not a whole lot of decisions were 
made;  mostly we just gave Grace an update on what we discussed last 
Wednesday.  

"DON'T QUOTE ME"
Mass mailing to all churches is our area as well as some selected churches 
outside our area  such as Windsor Village, Mount Vernon, St. Agnes, Abundant 
Life, Good Hope, Lakewood and Memorial. Target date: Nov. 15th and Dec. 1 cut 
off

Curtis spoke to Shaun McLemore yesterday?.  He said something about having 
nice and lengthy conversation with him regarding some CD.  Like I said "DON'T 
QUOTE ME"   but Shaun was OK with it as long as there would be no 
reproduction of it to make a profit.  That's all I can remember now.  I'll 
see you tonight at choir rehearsal.
