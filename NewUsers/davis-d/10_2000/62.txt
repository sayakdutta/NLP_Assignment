I will be taking a 1/2 day of vacation on Friday.  I am trying to do the 
majority of the necessary preparation for our trip before Friday.  I am also 
still trying to decide whether or not we will do hair tonight.  Do you 
already have the perm?  I did get some type of directions from Denise too.  I 
am printing them now and placing them in my purse so we will have them.
