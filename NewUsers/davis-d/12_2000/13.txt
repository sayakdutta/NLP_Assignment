Denise, Caroly, Claudette -
What do you think about me forwarding Marilyn's message to the prayer ministry









Good morning ladies,

     The ballet is still on for Tuesday.  I had originally planned to pick
up each girl, however, I am on special assignment on the Southwest side of
time.  So, if you would, please have take them to Carolyn Ashley's house by
6:15 pm.  The ballet begins at 7:30 pm.  If they are not able to go, please
let me know, so I can make arrangements to take another girl.

Denise
