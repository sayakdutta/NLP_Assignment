That's what I needed.  Thanks! : )









I think you should ask her.  I believe she wanted it to stay amongst those
on her list, otherwise she could have forwarded it to others.

Good morning ladies,

     The ballet is still on for Tuesday.  I had originally planned to
pick
up each girl, however, I am on special assignment on the Southwest side
of
time.  So, if you would, please have take them to Carolyn Ashley's house
by
6:15 pm.  The ballet begins at 7:30 pm.  If they are not able to go,
please
let me know, so I can make arrangements to take another girl.

Denise
