Yes, I have thought about being an Admin.  I just don't see any entry level administrative positions out there. 

 

HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT TRYING TO BE AN ADMIN.?  SEEMS LIKE YOU'VE BEEN A CLERK FOR A WHILE.  DO YOU HAVE TO HAVE CERTAIN THINGS B/F YOU CAN MOVE UP?

 



 

Dana,

I am the person handling this opening.  I have sent your resume to the hiring manager.  I will relate any updates to you.

Thanks,
Jamie
