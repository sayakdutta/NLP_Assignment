george,  here is some info...
 

John -

Sorry I was on the phone and didn't talk......hope that you are doing OK too!!!  I am hanging in there.....

Here is a q&a regarding the cash balance plan.

Will there be changes to the Cash Balance Plan as a result of the Bankruptcy and are the assets safe from creditors?
No changes have been made to the plan to-date. It is a possibility that the Company may have to reconsider the continuance of future accruals for active employees. If this does occur, accrued benefits will be frozen but interest will continue to be credited. 
The Trust holding the Cash Balance Plan assets is not part of the bankruptcy estate and is not subject to the claims of Enron's creditors. 
There is a lot of q&a's posted on www.enron.com which you may find helpful if I am not available to assist!  Let me know if you need anything else......
