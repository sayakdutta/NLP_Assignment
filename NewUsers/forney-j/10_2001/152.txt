The purpose of this toy is to paint certain blocks,  ie 14-22 and get an average in the excel format.   I have found this to be a quick and easy to use tool.
I used a similar tool in the California pool.    For example,  take yesterday and compare to today, same period.   Factor in weather,  unit outages, etc.

This should give you a general idea of where prices should be for these hours.

Let me know your feedback.
