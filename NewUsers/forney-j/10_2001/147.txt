I am discussing this with Cara at Tenaska.   She is going to send more support for this.

John,

This LD from Tenaska is still an issue.  Are we going to pay it?

Rebecca

 

What's the status of these LD's?

Thanks,
Elsie

 

Rebecca,
	Should I pay Tenaska?  Amt is $12,000

Thanks,
Elsie


 

Rebecca,
	Have we heard from John?  We've received Tenaska's  invoice.

Thanks,
Elsie

John,

I need an answer on the 6/15/01 Tenaska LDs I gave to you a few weeks ago.  They are calling daily asking the status and sent an invoice for payment today.

Thanks,

Rebecca
