I saw the memo.   It is true about the startup charges.   It is listed in the Purchase and Sale Agreement.
Is there more that we need to discuss on this deal?

Thanks,

Does it need to go in the ERCOT ASSET Book, TECO SVC Book, or Hourly ERCOT book?

I spoke with Clint--he's familiar with this situation.  Basically, if we don't call on the option for a certain amount of time, we are responsible for start-up charges when we do call it.  It should be a charge to John's Book.

John--see Clint & myself on this.

On 9/17 there is a start charge for 1376.90.  I spoke with Lisa and she said we incur these charges when we do not call on an option, or when we miss calling on an option for 12 consecutive hours.  In this particular case, she said we incurred the charge because we called again on it.  Do you know where in the contract that it talks about this?

Thanks,
