Settlements and Risk have blessed our version of the procedures.    Now we need to run this by Teco.   
Should I call Frank Busot to discuss,  or is this an item for discussion in the meeting on Tuesday?

We have already received their invoice for June and they have again invoiced us at the sales price, rather than the minimum market price.

I will be involving Clint in the reconciliation to give him some exposure to this side.

What do you think?
