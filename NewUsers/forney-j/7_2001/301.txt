I need your help to make September 1 physical delivery happen. Please talk amongst yourselves and set up meetings as necessary. Just keep me in the loop. 

Rogers Herndon and I (and others) are going to meet this Friday to go over the report. Please have your plans of action/feedback/comments to me by Thursday morning, so I can make sure they get included in the report he sees. 

 

Thanks for all your help so far.
