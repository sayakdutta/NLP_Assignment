Sure,  I am online everyday.
I get in about 6 am, usually putting the numbers on at 6:30.   I start with hr ending 8-22 and change to 9-22 usually when the first interval of he 9 is printed. 
This is at my discretion.   
You may post a limit order (either a bid or offer) that covers mine and transact online.   You wont necessarily be trading with me,  another counterparty can lift your offer or hit your bid.

Let's trade it up!!!

Are you all still showing numbers for intraday ERCOT swaps?  If so when do
you normally post them.  Thanks.
