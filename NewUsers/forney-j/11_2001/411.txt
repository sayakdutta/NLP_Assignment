Frontera was asked to generate 135 mw's for this day.    They were generating but our meter read was showing zero.    Ercot was also showing zero.
Steve Olinde called and Frontera assured us that they were running.     
We will need to file a dispute for approx hours ending 1 - 7?
I am not sure when the meter came back,  but it was ok when I came in this morning.

Thanks,
JMF
