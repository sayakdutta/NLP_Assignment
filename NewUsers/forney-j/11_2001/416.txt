We are long 50 mw's for 16 hours Saturday and Sunday.    The length is under the Ercot Asset book and the cost is $15.    I am concerned about Sunday morning,  specifically,  hours ending 7-11.   If you could sell  this for a decent price,  it would be a good thing.  The purchase is an interdesk deal,  so it wont show in Enpower Scheduling.
Also,  for hours ending 15-20 on Sunday we are long an additional 100 mw's at $16.31.   The purchase is under deal #873330 from City of Austin.  The temps are supposed to be warm and it should be muggy on Sunday ahead of the cold front.    This is scheduled to the North Zone under Enpower 873332.  Either leave alone or sell under the Ercot Asset book.

For Monday,  we are long 50 mw's onpeak under another interdesk deal.   The length cannot be seen in Enpower scheduling.      This deal is under Ercot Asset and has been scheduled to load (north) under deal #873255.   Also,  we have another 100 mw's from COA (see Enpower #873330) for he 15-20.     
This is scheduled to north zone under enpower #873332.


Dont forget that the night crew will report to the new building Sunday evening.   The phones are to be inactivated here at 5:30 pm Sunday.


Thanks and lets trade it up!
