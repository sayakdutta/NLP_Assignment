Thanks for listening  on last week's phone call.       I have been asked to help Doug Gilbert-Smith get Ercot off of the ground as far as Services and Hourly trading is concerned.     If you have not  heard,   the Entergy and TVA cash trading positions will now be manned by one trader who will also trade the term markets.        This will give the traders the leverage needed to create value in these  respective regions.      My inexperience in the term  is the reason given for my implied demotion,   although these moves opened up cash trading opportunities for  other players.          This had been the first month that I've had  access to the prompt month and I am up nearly $500k;     there is no doubt in my mind that I was going to beat this region into a profitable proposition.

I have notified Presto that I would be joining Doug in Ercot,   but would be considering other options in Houston,  or even Portland.     I mentioned that I might call you and he has no problem with that.         The job in Houston may be a good opportunity,  however,   the environment here is not compatible with my personal and professional  goals.

I am looking for other opportunities,  preferably within the company.     If there are areas that you think might be a good match for my skill set,  let me know -   I would appreciate your consideration or suggestions.       You certainly are under no obligation to do this,   but I am confident that my track record will generate some interest within the company,   possibly on the retail side.       

Thanks for your time,

J Forney
