Bill,
I talked with Hans at the Autohaus and he relayed that the car was in good shape,  but did probably need a valve adjustment,  as you relayed.   Maybe also an oil leak fixed.     Also,   I asked him about the oil light and he seemed to think that the oil sensor needed replacing.
The Porsche certainly requires more attention than most cars,  the clutch being a common and costly repair. 

The exterior of the car is in fair condition.     Maybe a detail shop could tell me whether some of the scratches could be buffed out.
I'm not sure if you have checked into painting while you had the car,  but you cant get it done inexpensively.

I am still interested in the car and I would like my wife to be able to take a look at it.     However,   I am leaving town tomorrow and wont be back until   Sunday.    Maybe we can meet then.   
If our discussions progress and you havent already sold or traded in the car,   I would like to have it checked out mechanically (at my cost)  and would like a detail shop to give me an assessment of what they could do with the finish.
I realize the car is not perfect and it is eleven years old,  but it is a large investment.....

Thanks,  Bill for your time.   
  My cell number is 713-412-7529.
