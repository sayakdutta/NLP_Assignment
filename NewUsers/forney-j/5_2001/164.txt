i have notified Presto that I will be looking internally.    i am talking to portland,   as they want me back.      i have been moved to the Texas region to supply the Texas Choice and EES customers on an hourly basis.     I would manage this desk and, once again ,   have an hourly crew,  much the same as I did in California.      That is not the job I signed up for when I moved 3,000 miles to Houston.      I have already been there,  done that and I am not  pleased about it so far,   but it will be allright.      If I did this job,   it would become a big success and then I would have to hear about how lucky I was.

I'll keep you posted......it's shit like this that keeps work interesting.
