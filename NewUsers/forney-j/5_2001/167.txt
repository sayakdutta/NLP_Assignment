Elizabeth,
My name is John Forney and I am the new Electricity  Cash trader in the Entergy region,  reporting to Kevin Presto.         I received a letter agreement from Entergy that seeks to clarify the Entergy  "Into"  definition.   Rogers Herndon has relayed that we have tried to get them to transact under an EEI agreement,  where they have been willing to only operate under WSPP.    They are trying to get us to agree to use the WSPP contract with EEI  liquidated damages language.
I need to meet with you on this issue.   Rogers is available to anwer questions on the background of this ,   if necessary.


Thanks,
JMF
