How's it going in PDX?     Things very different here in this "market."    It is difficult to trade against monopoly power.      Book currently melting down,  however,  things are turning around.       Here;   nuke goes down,  very hot weather............. prices tank.     The transmission is controlled by utility rednecks who load up the capacity,   driving up prices,  and they release the capacity in mid trading,  crushing the dailies.    We cant buy transmission and hold it in this manner.       Pig forkers!     
Anyway,  I havent been accepted into the bubba club yet,   but I'm still trying.    Presto and the other traders call my region "Jimmy land,"  as most of the players are rednecks named Jimmy.

Hope the wife and Floyd are doing well.     Lot's of bad golf being played here!

Let me know when you are coming down - we will drink tequila at the Cadillac Bar.
