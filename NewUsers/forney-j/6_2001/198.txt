My records indicate that you currently have a need for a(n) Analyst/Associate.  In order to assist Analysts/Associates that are looking for new rotations in the June - September, 2001 time frame, please verify that this need is still available.  If your position has been filled, please send the name of the Analyst/Associate that has filled the position so that we may make the appropriate changes in SAP.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation!
