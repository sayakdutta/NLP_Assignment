Lisa,
I will be out of the office for one half day on Friday and a full day on Monday.   Can you list my Monday time as my floating holiday?
I will obviously not be able to attend the meeting at 3pm,  but I am available by cell.

There will be an Eservices Meeting June 25, 2001 in EB30c1 from 3:00-3:30 with Kevin Presto and Tom May.  If you have any questions or I can be of further assistance please let me know.

Thank You
