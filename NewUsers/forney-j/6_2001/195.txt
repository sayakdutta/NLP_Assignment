The opportunity here has been enhanced;   in addition to Managing RT,   I would be managing all of the Service Assets in Texas.   This includes trading around a 500 mw plant,   serving EES and New Power Company loads,  and also the potential for managing a new 1500 mw full requirements deal. 
Of course,  I would have to have all of this in writing.      I would be working with the Texas Term trader to enhance my trading skills in order to effectively manage this position.
This makes the offer more attractive,  but still I would be in Houston.      I am still apprehensive of the bait & switch exposure.
What do you think?

Anything new going on w/ your current hunt for opportunities.
