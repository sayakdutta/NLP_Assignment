We received your order through the Signature Shop for Astros tickets.
However, at this time we do request that when placing any orders via credit
card, that you also provided us with your Enron coding (Co/Rc). This is
used for tracking purposes and will ONLY be charged, if payment can not be
made by the credit card given. We also need your EB location to have
tickets delivered. Your order is on hold until information is received. You
must send by replying to this message. If you have any questions please
fell free to call.


***Please note- that due to the volume of orders received and the limited
quantity, if we receive no response in 24hrs your order will be canceled
and you will have to reorder via on-line.


Thank you
