NEVER FEED STRAY ANIMALS -  THEY KEEP COMING BACK
 

I have a couple other questions that you may be able to help with.

Have you or anyone in your area looked at the metering requirements for curtailable loads?  Typical cost/configuration/communications support - etc.
How do CPS-1 & CPS-2 play out in the ERCOT market?  Controls on paying for a service versus leaning on the grid.
