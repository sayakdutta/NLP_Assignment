We have not scheduled this load as of yet.   I met with Narasimha yesterday in order to cut through the b.s. and get at least a rudimentary plan in place.
Here it is:
	By 7am - EES submits to us their  load plan / hedges - EES to use their forecast initially.
	We cover open position and submit schedules to Ercot
	We monitor Real Time and handle continigencies
	Wholesale settlement provided,   ancillary service charges , local congestion,  etc is to be passed to EES.

Narasimha will provide the load info and we are projecting a September 1st start  at the latest.    

We are preparing a term sheet today that will reflect the basic requirements above.    We will certainly add more complexity to this deal in the form of fixing exposure to A/S and other charges.   
We are prepared to go forward with this immediately.

Team,

I'm not sure what has been communicated regarding the enrollments.  I wanted to ensure everyone was aware of the current status. 

The (5) packaged ice accounts were accepted by TXU and load availability was confirmed.  The 814 enrollment request will be submitted today/tomorrow by CSC.

The (28) target accounts were rejected by Reliant as the rate class is full. There is no load available.

Please advise if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Rebecca
