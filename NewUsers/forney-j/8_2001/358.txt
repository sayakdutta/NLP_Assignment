Hi Stranger...


In answer to your question, Kevin and/or Doug will be doing your review.  When he presents it to you, it will be final barring any changes the two of you may make together or your personal comments.  Once you sign it, it can not be altered.   In answer to the question on your personnel file, you should be able to view it in my presense (hr security policy)  Let me find out how that can be arranged for you.  Nothing should have been added to the file w/o you knowledge eg. counseling forms and such since you would have to sign off on them)  I can request a copy of your most recent employment agreement for you.  We should have it shortly.

 



Kim,
Havent talked to you for awhile.    Hope everything is going well.
I do have a question about who will be doing my review.     Also,  dont we still have a rating system?     I would like to see my entire review and have the opportunity to sign off on it.   
Also,  is it possible for me to review my personel file?   Is this within company policy?

Lastly,   can you provide to me a copy of my contract?    Mine is packed in a box somewhere due to the move.

Thank you for your time.
