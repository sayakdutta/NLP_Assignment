 



Ercot is now requiring that we fill out and fax the attached form to  them when we have imported/exported across one of the DC ties.
The file is located in:

M:electric/24hour/ercot/dc schedlist.spreadsheet.


Please update tag number,  megawatts (positive for exports, negative for imports),   and total number of schedules.
