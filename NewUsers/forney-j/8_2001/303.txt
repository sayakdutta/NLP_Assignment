Hourly deals should be under Teco SVC the majority of the time.    However,  at times Enron's option (under Ercot Asset book)  will be long into the Real Time market.
This is Frontera generation,  but Enron bought it in the form of the option. 
You will see deals of this type for today under the Ercot Asset.

So hourly deals:
Teco Services - 99% of time
Ercot Asset - 1 %
Hrly Ercot - NEVER




Jeff or John,

Please confirm for me that HRLY-ERCOT should NOT have any deals with Frontera and that all "hourly" deals with Frontera should be with the TECO-SVCE book.
