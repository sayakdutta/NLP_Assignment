Johnny,
What is the status of George?   I think that you have been speaking with Lloyd Will concerning bringing him over from EES.   George is inquiring about his status and wants to know whether he should mention anything to EES.    I would think not, at this time.
Lloyd is out of town until Monday,  so I am trying to follow up on his behalf.


Thanks,
JForney
