Rebecca,
We have heard that the resource imbalance was pretty high.     We will discuss this with you.   We definitely dont want to talk to Teco/Frontera until we get a handle on this.
We will come by this afternoon.

The ERCOT invoice extract is available and has been copied to M:\Eservices\ERCOT\ERCOT_System_Extracts\.  I will save these files to this directory on a daily basis for your information and review. Here is a copy of the 7/31/01 file.

Jeff & John - ERCOT is not showing what we expected for Load Imbalance.  We need to get together and discuss this difference.  Also - do you have any information about what TECO's resource imbalance should have been?

Thanks,

Rebecca
