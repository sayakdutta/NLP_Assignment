Kim,
Keenon has been recommended to Doug as a possiblity in RT.   I think our roster has been filled out,  however,  I had promised this guy an interview before I knew that Lloyd had lifted some people.
Can we schedule an interview with Keenon,  as I think that he is a strong prospect.

I will send you a copy of his resume via office mail.     He can be reached at 713-410-2255.

Please let me know what you think.

Thanks,
JForney
