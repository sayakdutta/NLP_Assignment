I played the last four days:
barton creek in Austin 
ColoVista in Bastrop (near Austin) 
Fish Creek
Fish Creek yesterday.

I am hitting the ball alot better and starting to make some putts.   I wont be around this weekend,   as I am vacationing down in South Padre Island for the next few days.
We need to take that boat out so I can show you around Galveston.    Fishing is good and you can pull up to certain restaraunts on the water.
Let me know when you wanna go.

John,  I am available to play golf this Sunday if you are thinking about
playing.  Also, I live next to #3 on TPC and we can just walk out after 6pm
and play holes for nothing.  I may walk over and play 9 one night this week.
