David,
we often trade with EPMI, as they may be the best bid on any given day.      So,   the language should apply.

Thx,
JMF

 

Please make lower case the words "contract price" in second sentence of the indented item Contract Price:  Resale of the Contract Quantity in a Back-to-Back Transaction/EPMI Transaction has been effected at the contract price of US Dollars $60.00/MWh. Clint or John -- is it true that sometimes these balance-of-the-month sales may be EPMI Transactions, or will they always be Back-to-Back Transactions with third parties?  If they'll never be EPMI transactions, then we can remove that reference from the red sentence above.  --DP  

   

This is the confirmation for the fixed price deals, containing the newly revised language.  Please review and let me know when the language has been agreed on to include in the confirmations.

Thanks!
