absolutely, it would be nice to have a foursome so they can't put a single
with us.  I will change the sunday tee time to a twosome but I am glad we
will get to play 36 holes on Saturday.

Scott,
The wife is out of town until Saturday night.    I can play alot of golf on
Saturday,  but I need to spend time with the wife on Sunday.     I will be
available for the golf marathon on Saturday.    I have one player for
Saturday morning,  but I dont have a player for Sat. afternoon yet,
although I have another co-worker who is interested.
Should I fill this spot as well?

   John,  I am setting up a tee time for Sunday 8/5 around 8-9 AM at
   Augusta
   Pines.  I just wanted to confirm if you could play Saturday afternoon at
   TPC
   or Sunday morning at Augusta Pines?

   Talk to you soon,

   Scott

   
            

   Scott,
   I heard that the TPC was in decent shape.    Are you planning on playing
   on
   Saturday in the morning or afternoon?
   How many people do you have in the group?
