Mark,
We have a question related to the acquisition of ancillary services;       Ercot publishes their various A/S requirements on a daily basis.
We have noticed that you dont procure up to the amount that you say that you require.

For example,  on 9/27,   Ercot published that the System Requirements are 1,800 mw for Regup.      Ercot procured only approx. 117 mw's each hour.
The same thing occurs for REGDN and Responsive.

Is Ercot satisfying their reserve requirement needs with OOM and Upbalancing,  etc.?


Otherwise,  he can be reached at 713-853-9310.


Thanks for your help!
