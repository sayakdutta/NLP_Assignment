Jerry,
Please see the attached spreadsheet for tomorrow.
We booked you out on the Enron option for $22.25.    So,  we are selling you next day for $22.25.
Also,  to fill Mirant's call for 12-22 we purchased $23 power from Aquila.    This should get you flat for the day.

We will not run tomorrow,  as of now.    We will reflect this in the Resource Plan and reflect that the unit is unavailable and offline.
