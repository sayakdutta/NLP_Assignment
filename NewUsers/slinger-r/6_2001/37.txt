There is no enpower to CAPS for 6/21 since the ISO computers went down and they do not have any finals for HE 21.  They said that some time around noon today they will try to repost the data after their guys recover it from the down servers.  Somebody in Houston or here may be able to just make the preferred the final for that hour, however this is something that I never learned how to do so I am going to have to pass on doing that.

thanks,

ryan
