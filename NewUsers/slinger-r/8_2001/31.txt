We had some problems scheduling ARCO as the ISO had a 10.8 mw curtailment scheduled for ARCO through HE 24 for 8/1/01.  In order to schedule the extra 6mw for 8/1/01 I had to change that outage and set the curtailment at 5mw and that is scheduled through 9/1/01.  The ISO had two separate outage schedules and I said to just go with the 5mw curtailment until you guys could get back with them on the exact outage.

Thanks,

ryan
