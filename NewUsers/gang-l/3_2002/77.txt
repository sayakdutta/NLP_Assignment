Laurel, I just auto scheduled through the 29th.  We have had major system problems, We apologize for the delay.  Let me know if this worked.  I'm still not 100% confident regarding our system.

Do you know when you will have yesterday scheduled?  We need that info to complete our daily reports and I need to let some people know when they will be available?

Thanks,
Laurel

I am not sure what you  are asking, but we run this report everyday for the east and west performance books and there is always liquidations.  Today (for 3-26-2002) we are only able to see liquidations for the east book and I am certain there are liquidations for the west book also.

    I am looking at that.
The last schedule strip for that desk has ToDate  3/24/2002.
Was WEST and that desk scheduled ?

Do you have an estimate of when we can run the PSCNA for West?  (East ran with information, it was just west that was a problem.)  We need to send out our reports that include that information in the next hour.

Thanks,
Laurel
