 

Scheduling will resume as normal on Friday July 5th for SW and NW.  I will come in and schedule.  For California, we can schedule in advance on the 3rd for July 4th-8th.  I will be here to cover for California on Friday in case of problems.

What are we doing to cover scheduling over the holiday weekend?

 

Happy 4th!
