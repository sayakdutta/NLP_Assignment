LISA

 

From Manderan Cove?   Last time we ate there I was not stoked about the orange chicken.   But I could get something else if you want to go.  I was thinking about a Great Havest Sandwich.  Whatever though

 

yeah, i sort of want that orange chicken again...what do you think

 

What Up Gangstar?   You down to get lunch in a bit?  I am getting a little hungry, let me know.

peace,
