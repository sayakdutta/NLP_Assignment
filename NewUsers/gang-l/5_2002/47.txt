  We are having a going away lunch for Susan Rance tomorrow, Thursday May 9, 2002 at the Rock Bottom Brewery.  The reservations are for 11:45 am and under Susan Rance's name.  They have requested to have only one check for the table.  

  Please join us in wishing Susan an awesome farewell to sunny San Diego!

  Please let us know if you can make it so we can reserve enough seats.
