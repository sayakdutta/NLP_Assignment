Bob,

I would like to put a contract in place with the following counterparty.  I think a GISB contract will be sufficient since the transactions 
will be 1 month or shorter.

El Paso Field Services
Sam Ansley
 (832) 676-5555
FAX (832) 676-1483

Let md know if you need additional info.  Thanks.

Scott
