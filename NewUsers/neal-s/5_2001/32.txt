I definately support  a promotion.  I have not given up on the contract, although I have not figured out how to make it more palatable for her while ensuring 
she is committed to Enron.

Scott, Tammi told me that she has chosen not to sign the Employment Contract.  I understand her issues.  Even before she informed me of her decision I was thinking that we should support her for mid-year promotion to Director.  I would like to get your thoughts on this.
