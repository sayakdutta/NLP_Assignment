Scott,

Thanks for the help with Dave Duran.  He wants to offer me a job, and he sent 
me to talk to Louise Kitchen today, which I did.  She told me that she wanted 
to check my references.  I was wondering if you would be willing to drop her 
a note on me.  She would probably put a lot more stock in your view than in 
most of the other guys I have worked with in EI and EBS.  Thanks, I 
appreciate it.

Steve
