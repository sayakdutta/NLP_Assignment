Hey Guys - 

Thank you so much for taking time to call the individuals assigned to you.  

Please try to contact anyone tonight that you were unable to reach yesterday.

After you have reached all your candidates,  please drop me a quick e-mail including whether or not they should continue in the interview process and a concrete reason why. 

Call me with any questions.  I will follow up tomorrow afternoon.  It is urgent that we make our decisions soon as the next step in the interview process is a week away.

Thanks again!
