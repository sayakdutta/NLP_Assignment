Thank you for the invitation but I will be unable to attend. 
  Have a great time and thanks again for thinking of me and Enron.













Good morning, everyone.

Our meeting planner has informed me that we have not received responses from
you regarding our 2000 Customer Meeting at Nemacolin, Aug 28-30.  Please
fill out and fax the attached sheet to let us know whether you plan to
attend.  If you don't have time to fill out the sheet today, please respond
to me by e-mail or phone (713) 215-4015.  Our final guest count is due; so
if you could let me know today, I would appreciate!

Thank you,   Ingrid
