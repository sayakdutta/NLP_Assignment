that sounds great. thank you so much.  see you tomorrow

 

Hey, there.  You're probably going to need your clothes over the holiday
season.  Why don't I drop them off for you tomorrow morning around 9:15 or
so, and you can have your assistant come down to get them.  Would that work
ok?  No hurry here.  Just thought you might want them.
