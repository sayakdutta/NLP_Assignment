Dear PIRA Client,

Please be advise that due to the local telephone strike in New York,  PIRA's

telephone service is experiencing problems. Due to these problems you may

have, or might in the near future, experience difficulties reaching us  via

phone. (Note: Messages saying that the PIRA phone number is disconnected

are erroneous.)

Until service is resumed as normal - which we expect to be shortly -  clients

requiring immediate access to PIRA staff should contact us via email (see

list below) or via (212) 686-6628. Someone will field your incoming email  or

call and return the call as soon as possible.

Thank you.
