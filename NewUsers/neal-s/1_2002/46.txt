I think chuck will do these

 

 << File: pete's products.xls >> 


Here is a list of Pete's EOL products. Thanks.




 

Jon Mckay will manage Brad's products.  What products had we assigned to Pete?

 


Scott,

Now that Brad and Pete are gone, who do you want to do thier products that we had set them up on previously? Thanks.

Scott
3-6599
 

Now that we know which traders will be moving over, or we should, we need to make a second pass at the EOL product list.  Can you confirm with your desk heads that the list of names we have is correct, and then update the product mappings by tomorrow afternoon?
