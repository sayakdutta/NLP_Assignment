We had talked about suspending the United Way contribution but let's not worry about it at this point. 
Thanks for your help.

Is this correct or was it made in error?  Let me know.
 

Jeanie,  What I see is a deduction for United Way in the amount of 1500.00 and a deduction for Parking in the amount of 37.00.  Please let me know if he has additional questions.

On Scott's last paycheck-Dec.31.  there was a deduction labeled "other deductions" for 1537.  Is there anyway we can determine what exactly that was for?  Thanks much.
