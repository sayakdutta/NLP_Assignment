John Lavorato has asked me to pull together a meeting for 2:00 p.m. today, January 30.  The meeting will take place in Conf RM 06736.  Sorry guys, I don't have a subject.  Please advise me only if you are unable to attend.  I suggest blocking off at least an hour for this meeting.

Many Thanks,

Liz Taylor x31935
