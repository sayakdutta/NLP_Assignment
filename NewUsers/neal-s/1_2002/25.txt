I am sure that I have accidentally left off someone that should receive a copy of this, if so please forward it.  Legal will be providing a "Contract 101" class at some point to discuss these documents as well as Masters, GISB's, etc.  Please review this material and provide me with any material comments that you may have.  I will aggregate any comments and coordinate with legal.
