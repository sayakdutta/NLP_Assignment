Phil Gas Works has asked me several times to ome uop and visit them when I 
get a chance especially to talk about their winter RFP they are putting 
together.   Also Maureen and I were hoping to plan a trip togeher to see 
PSE&G, but now Maureen is going to have to postpoone for a while

I was looking at the calendar and it looks like the 19 and 20th would be good 
days.  Does this sound okay with you?          Thanks.
