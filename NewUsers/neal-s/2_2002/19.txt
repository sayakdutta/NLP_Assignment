Randy,

I hope all is well with you.  Hopefully, we will be starting up in the next weeks as UBS.

I don't know if you are still in the market for people.  I have attached the resume of Vickie Versen
for your review.  She was most recently responsible for trading physical gas in the Gulf.  She came out of 
our scheduling/logistics group and has extensive experience working on several East pipes.  I think she would 
consider a trading or scheduling position.

Sincerely,

Scott Neal
