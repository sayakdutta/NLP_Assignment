I think January 9-10 is better because many people will be away the first few 
days of the year.

Scott,

Find attached my resume as we had arranged yesterday.
I you believe that I should be there the sooner the better I'll reschedule my 
vacations so as to be there on the first of January, if you believe arriving 
there on January 9 or 10 is OK I'll do that.
Probably on the first week of January people wont be at the office from their 
holyday season.???



Thanks buddy I appreciate your help.
