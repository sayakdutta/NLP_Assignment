Dear Alumni,
This is the first of many emails that will hopefully bring together the
actives and Alumni.  This directory list was created to benefit Alumni with
knowledge of semester activities.  Please respond to this if there needs to
be a correction in email address or otherwise.
Thanks,
Michael Nasra
Alumni Secretary
