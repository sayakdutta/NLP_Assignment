 Due to the postponement of the ENA Offsite Meeting in Las Vegas (Dec
13-15), your airline reservation was cancelled.  Enron has chosen to ask us
to apply the value of your nonrefundable ticket for this meeting towards the
cost of a new non-refundable ticket for a future business trip, saving Enron
several thousand dollars in unused tickets. A $75.00 airline re-booking  fee
will be charged in addition to the cost of the flight selected. This ticket
must be booked and used within the next 12 months.
 Please contact Joel Juarez at Planners Services Group (only) at
281-586-8181 with your upcoming travel needs, and all details   for a
replacement ticket will be coordinated.
