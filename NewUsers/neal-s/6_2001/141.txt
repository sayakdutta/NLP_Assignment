John Hodge requested some information from Scott Neal.

He would like to see the # of counterparties we did physical trades with in the year 2000 and the volumes by month (sales) in New Jersey.

There are two Notional curves (locations) that are in New Jersey.  IF-TETCO/M3 and TRANSCO/Z6NONNY.


I cannot find any old files from Nagesh but I just need to see the volumes for the year and the number of counterparties.  I don't need to see the counterparty names just the number of counterparties for the year.
