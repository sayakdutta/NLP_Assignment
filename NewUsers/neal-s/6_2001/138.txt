Colton and I will not be able to attend.  Sorry for the late response.  Have a great time.

 

So far we have a pretty good turn out for the camp out.  The rest of you
that have not rsvp'd can still let me know by first thing tomorrow.  I know
you're waiting for those baseball tournament schedules to decide.  The only
thing I need to know is if you will be there for dinner, otherwise come and
go as you wish.

If you decide to join us later and we are not at the house, we are at the
beach or at the water slide down the street.  Any questions call our cell
phones.  Rod at 713-249-9300 and me at 281-389-9366.
