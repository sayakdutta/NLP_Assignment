Scott, hope all is well.  Sorry that I have been so out of touch lately.  
Trying to get deals closed sell a house buy a house so on and so on.  I am 
going to be in the Houston office on Wed and Thur (Nov 8 & 9).  Can we get 
together ?  What is good for you ?  When are they planning to announce all of 
this ?  I want to initiate ideas and discussions with other team members but 
do not want to jump the gun.  Maybe everyone already knows.  Being in 
Portland it is hard to tell.


Frank
