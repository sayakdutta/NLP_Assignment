Hello LSU Team,

The following is a list of candidates who were interviewed on the 18th Super 
Saturday.  Please note the contact person assigned to each candidate.  Each 
contact person should call and cultivate their assigned candidates.  
Cultivation is essential.  We want to ensure that  our candidates will choose 
Enron instead of a competitor.

I am proud to inform you that  ALL 12 candidates were extended offers from 
Enron.  They are as follows:

Brad Guilmino  Randy Maffett
Bradley Jones  Mary Perkins
Chelsea Buras  Kevin Hughes
Edward Brady  Maria LeBeau
Kevin Murray  Tim Blanchard
Leonidas Savvas Joe Deffner
Lindsay Culotta  Ben Markey
Milagros Daetz  Jere Overdyke
Ryan Thibideaux Scott Neal
Shereka Jefferson Hang Bui
Stephanie Hopkins Steve Venturatos
Timothy Taylor   Brenda Herod/Bryan Hull

Their contact information is in the following attachment.  Please make a 
contact call once a week until they accept.  I will send them a gift a week 
as long as our budget allows.  If you are unable to call them once a week 
please contact another team member to call in your place. 




Tigers Rock!!!!   100%

Thanks, Geynille
