You are welcome to come down any day. 

 I think that changing the time on the 29th would be good since we are still in "bid week" that day.

Thanks,

Scott
 

Scott - 

I think we are going to move the afternoon start time to 4pm rather than 3pm.

I would love to still come down and sit with you one morning...is there any day this week that works for you?

Thanks so much!
