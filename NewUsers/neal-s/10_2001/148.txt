 >Brothers, 
I read the recent newsletter from Texas Gamma...glad things are going 
well. 
Unfortunately I will be unable to attend alumni weekend, but do have 
some info to share with you for Spring newsletter. Many of the brothers 
from 1981-87 may recall I was an active accordionist. I recently won an 
international accordionist competition in the catagory of Texas Folk 
Music and they have established my webpage as part of the prize. Please 
share this info and address with our brothers.
