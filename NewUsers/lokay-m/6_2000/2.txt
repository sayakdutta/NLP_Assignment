Met with Lee Hart.  Reliant is interested in bidding for the capacity being 
auctioned on EnronOnLine, but will probably not respond until Monday.  
Reliant is also interested in the concept of fuel monetization and will 
definitely work with us to give shipper's perspective.

Attended meeting with Conoco (Carla Johnson and Mary Ann Pearce) and Steve 
Harris, Rockey Storie to discuss potential settlement of Northern Natural 
take or pay case.

Introduced myself to Cathy Bulf of Oneok (KN).  They are also interested in 
the auctioned capacity.
