Michelle,

Per our conversation BRTI and Transwestern agree to increase the MDQ  of transportation contract 27748 from 10,000 MMBtu per day to 33,000
MMBtu per day, effective 12/14/01 - 12/31/01.  The agreed to rate for the incremental transportation quantity of 23,000 MMBtu/day is $.055
per MMBtu plus fuel.  As agreed, BRTI will have alternate receipt points from Ignacio (500535) and La Plata (500533) as well as EPNG Blanco
as an alternate delivery point.

Thank you,

Julie
