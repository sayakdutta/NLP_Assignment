Approved.  The contract number will remain the same, #27785.  

Dennis,
Per conversation, same contract, volume, and rate for 1 additional day.  Thanks.




Michelle:  This is a request to extend our transportation agreement for one more day through December 18 at the agreed upon $.08/MMBtu demand fee.  

Could you let me know whether we can keep the same contract number or not.

Thanks, Terri Dickerson
