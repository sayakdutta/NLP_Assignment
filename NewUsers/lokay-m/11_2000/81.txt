CORRECTION
In the document I sent out this morning, "Instructions to install Internet 
explorer 5" The Instructions said to type: "U:\COMMOM\ie5\i386\setup.exe" in 
the
run dialog box. It should have read "N:\common\ie5\i386\setup.exe" .  
I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. If you have any 
problems with or questions about the install please call the help desk at 
78-7454

Thank you

On Monday, December 4th, a new version of the Marketing Dashboard will be 
rolled out. In order for this new version of The Dashboard to work you will 
need to have Internet Explorer 5.01(IE5.01) loaded on your system. If you 
already have IE5.01, PLEASE RESPOND, to this message  with a confirmation 
that you have IE5.01 or higher loaded. (No other action on your part is 
necessary)

If you DO NOT have IE5.01 please follow the instructions below to install it 
. then respond to this email that IE5 has been loaded. 

If you are uncomfortable doing the upgrade alone or are unsure what version 
of IE you have please call the helpdesk 87-7454 and someone will assist you.

Again please respond to this message ASAP - we are looking to have everyone 
in Houston upgraded by Dec 1st. The total process takes less that 15 
minutes.  If you have any question, comments or concerns please contact the 
helpdesk at 87-7454, 

Thank you
