Are we scheduled at certain time?  If I could be moved in the morning (I only have 2 boxes), that would be great.  I have customers coming in at 11:00 for the rest of the afternoon.  Thanks.

 

Your move has been scheduled for next Thursday, 3/14. All moves now take place during the day.

I'll deliver your pre-printed labels as soon as I get them from the Move Team, hopefully today. Please make sure to label everything that needs to be moved.

Call me if you have any questions.
