Attached is the spreadsheet from Facility Planning showing our costs.  James Centilli is running additional economics.  Will forward those as soon as I receive them.  I can also meet with you to discuss all.  Thanks.





Michelle:
Are there any summary economics for this yet?




Kevin,

here is the info on the PG&E project.

Thanks, Kim.
