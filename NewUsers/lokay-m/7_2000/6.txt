How about somewhere in between?  Where's Danetta?  Maybe Treebeards in 
Interfirst Plaza?









We haven't set a place yet, do you want to try Angelika in the Bayou place
or meet somewhere closer in between?  I am at 700 Louisiana. (Bank of
America)





Sounds great.  Phone number is 713-345-7932.

Michelle,

join us?
