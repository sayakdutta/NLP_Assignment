Hi...how are you?  Things are going well, but I sure miss you guys !  I left 
you a vmail last night saying that I can't attend Poli's party.  Jim, Meghan 
and I are going to be on vacation in California.

Let's talk soon and think about me when you guys go to Uncle Tongs!










Wish you were here!  Can't believe you got away so fast!
How's your job - is it you?
How's Meghan? (sp right?)  Bring her to Poli's party .... I hope you come.

Write me and let me know how you're doing when you can.  Did you buy a
house?
I really miss talking to you (and lunch!).   All my lunch partners are gone.
Linda's wedding is coming along.  The wedding is planned for Sept. 9 - be
here before you know it.
I hate it that I didn't get to say bye to you - you were always a pleasure
to talk to you - always "up" - which is good!
BYE - write when you can.
Marilyn
