Lisa,  Attached is a spreadsheet which divides the property.  Please review 
and note the following:

1.  No values for the 401K's are in the sheet.   Blank at this time.
2.  The blue values can be changed and the sheet should adjust accordingly.
3.  Please review the calculations behind the cells to understand how I am 
calculating the values on the sheet.



If you want to sit down and go over this together at your convenience, I 
would be happy to do so.
If you find something upsetting, please call and let's discuss before you 
talk to anyone else.

Gerald
