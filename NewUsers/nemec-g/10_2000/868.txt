Hi Katie,  You guys would love Cozumel.  Short flight, very cheap, and lots 
of fun.  If any of you Scuba Dive, Cozumel has some of the best diving in the 
world.  I had a blast down there.

Hope your Stats. class is going OK.  Unfortunately, I think that is one of 
those classes the just requires more effort than most classes. 

Work hasn't been too busy for me lately.  However, I know that will change as 
we get closer to the end of the year.  I do have a trip to Spain planned for 
November.  Some friends and I will be going over the Thanksgiving week.  We 
are flying into Madrid and will also go to Lisbon, Portugal.  Other than that 
we will work our way around the coast on the South of Spain.  I am really 
looking forward to it.  

Hope everything else is going well for you.  Are you sure you don't want to 
go for your Phd once you graduate.      : -)
