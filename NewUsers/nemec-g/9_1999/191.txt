Tom,  Those items will be sent to you tommorrow.










Gerald:
Thanks for the ROW Services Agreement.  It was great to meet you in
person and we thank you for bringing us on board for this project!  I think
the only materials we need to round out the picture are the letter
agreement with Forerunner and the agreement with Hanover.  Whenever
you have a chance to send those along, that will be great.
Regards,
Tom




Tom,  Attached is the Right of Way Services Agreement we discussed
Friday.  I
would like to thank you and Mark for meeting with us on short notice.  We
look
forward to working with you.
