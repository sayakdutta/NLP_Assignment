Richard,  I wouldn't worry about a letter.  It was a very informal 
submittal.  I will let my Associate friend know.  Thanks.

We have no interest. Do you think I need to write a rejection letter?

Richard,  The attached resume is from an attorney who is a friend of an 
Associate here at Enron.  I had worked with the Associate before but don't 
know his friend.  I told the Associate that I wasn't sure of our hiring 
needs, but that I would pass the resume along.  Barbara indicated you were 
our recruiting coordinator.  So here it is.
