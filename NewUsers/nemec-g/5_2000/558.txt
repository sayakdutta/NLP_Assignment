Gerald,

Please forgive me for the delay in getting back with you on this guaranty

Clement,  I had sent you a draft of a guaranty by Enron Corp. for ECS 
Compression Company, L.L.C. earlier.  Have you had a chance to review and 
obtain execution yet.  Please let me know the status.  Thanks for your help
