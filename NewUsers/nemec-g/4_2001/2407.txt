Hi Mom,  Hope everything is going well.  Sorry to hear about the relatives.  
I am doing fine.  Staying busy with work.  

I am scheduling a trip to China in June.  My friend Eric's has a brother who 
lives in China and is getting married to a Chinese national.  He invited me 
along, so I thought this would be a good opportunity to see a part of the 
world that I likely would not otherwise see.  We will be going from June 4  
through June 16.  Flying into the city of Shanghai and from there going to a 
smaller town called Qingdao.  The wedding will take place in Qingdao.  Should 
be interesting to experience a Chinese wedding.  We will then go to Beijing 
for sightseeing.  Forbidden City, Tianamen Square, Great Wall etc.    Should 
be a great experience.  

My roommate will be moving out in a couple of weeks and is getting married 
May 5 in Des Moines, Iowa.  I will going up for the wedding.  Take care and 
talk to you later.
