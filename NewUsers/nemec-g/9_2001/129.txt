David,  Attached is the document with the insurance mark-ups that I noted on my voice mail.  Please review and lets discuss.
 



Received from Sorrento.  I will phone when I have had a chance to review.
 



Mr. Johnson,
 
The Risk Management department at Sorrento Pipeline has reviewed this document and attached are the changes they would like to make to the insurance issues.
 
Thanks,
