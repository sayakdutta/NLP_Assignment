You are very welcome.   I had no intentions of seducing.  I didn't think you 
were going to be all over me like that.  Just kidding.  I had a good time 
also.  Have a great rest of the day.

Thank you for dinner last night. I have to say that I am quite impressed
with your culinary skills. Dave Matthews, grilled fish, great wine-if I
didn't know any better I would think you were trying to seduce me. Oh wait,
you did!

Thanks, I had a good time.
