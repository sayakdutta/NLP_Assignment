Since Eric is a contract employee, he was not included as part of the formal 
PRC process recently completed.  Therefore we would like to receive feedback 
from you concerning Eric's performance outside the performance management 
system.  I will be forwarding a hard copy Performance Evaluation form for 
your input.  You may either hand write or email the information back to me.  
Whichever is easier for you.  Please take time out of your busy schedules to 
complete the forms as soon as possible.  I would like to have a response by 
Aug. 24th.  Thank you for your time.
