I was thinking about coming into Austin Friday night and driving up with you 
guys on Saturday and staying in Austin again Saturday night.  I am going to 
have a friend with me (male unfortunately) since I have two tickets.  Let me 
know if that fits in with your plans.












Gerald,

The bus trip has been cancelled. We are all just driving down there. Let me
know what your plans are. I will talk to you later.
