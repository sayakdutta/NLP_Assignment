You had asked for more information regarding Canadian renewal rights. I found 
language in tariff in Transcanada's website (www.transcanada..com) under the 
following:

NOVA FTS-R, Sec 12, FTS-D, Sec 10
BC system, Sec 4.9

Bottom line: 12 month notice prior to end of term. Once notice given, 
irrevocable! Must extend for at least one year.

Please call if you have questions.
