Gerald,

I need a couple of CAs from you.  First of all, the North Coast Transmission 
LLC CA is finally ready to roll.

Address:
North Coast Gas Transmission LLC
1700 Westfield Dr.
Findley, OH  45840

Subject:
"discussion of potential options to maximize shareholder value with regards 
to North Coast's Intrastate Transmission Assets (Line #425, Line ADB-12, 
Ashland and Buckeye Lines)."

Second of all, I need a CA for JM Huber with the information as follows:

Address:
J. M. Huber Corporation
11451 Katy Freeway
Suite 400
Houston, TX  77079

Subject:
"discussion of potential horsepower services and producer outsourcing 
opportunities around properties in the Texas Panhandle and San Juan Basin"

I'm sure the subject matter language will require some massaging.  Also, are 
we on for sure next Monday for Tallahasee?  Let me know.

Thanks,
Chris
