Gerald,  I must apologize once again.  I will try to finish this up by
Monday.  I have been on course since Wednesday.  Thanks for your patience.

Ann,  Attached is the memo AEC forward with ENA's responses redline.
Please review.  When you get AEC's response completed we probably should
set up a conference call to discuss and finalize.  Thanks.
