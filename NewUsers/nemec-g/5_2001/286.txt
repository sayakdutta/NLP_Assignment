Chris,  Attached is the form of Professional Services Agreement to be used for Power Engineers.  I am assuming Power Engineers has no existing agreement with any other Enron entity.  We should ask them if this is the case.  The rate sheet they provided would be attached as Exhibit B.  Please review.  I am ok to forward this to Power Engineers for their review.
