Bill,  The answers as modified by you are fine.  Please forward those to Mr. Haswell at your earliest convenience.  I have still not received any response from Jeff Stone.


 

Gerald,

Haswell will be working tomorrow. He will not be in Thursday or Friday. I can call him tomorrow and that will give you the remainder of the afternoon to circulate your responses. I have to leave shortly for a dentists appointment of long standing. You could call Haswell if you prefer, but I think it better that I act as buffer. You can always fire me if I screw up.

Bill
