The product description was to be used for various pipelines (e.g. NGPL, Transco, etc.). Yes, in this product ENA would always be the seller or the buyer of the capacity to be released.  I visited with Steve earlier, and the concept that Julie Gomez had discussed earlier was allowing third party pipelines or third parties to use EOL to buy and sell capacity from or to other third parties.  As far as I know, these were just discussions and the only EOL product implemented was the one I forwarded to you.  

 

Gerald, is the capacity release for Columbia Pipeline the only transport or storage product offered on EOL that you know of?   Is Enron always the owner of the capacity to be released and acquired via EOL?  bng
