Raimund,  Attached is a form of amendment for both the Athens and Hartwell Precedent Agreement.  The amendment modifies the termination date as we discussed.  Two pieces of info that I left blank are the new date to be inserted and the date of execution of the original precedent agreements.  I do not have a copy of the dated executed PAs.  I do have a copy of the guaranties.  I will forward a copy to you.  Let me know if you have any questions.
