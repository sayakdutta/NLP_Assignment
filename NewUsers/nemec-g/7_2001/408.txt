Did she indicate why  they had Enron Energy Services on the cover memo.  Was that a mistake?

 


Gerald,

Sandra Grimes at Oasis Pipe Line Company e-mailed me copies of the entire contract.  She has indicated that these are the contracts which contain the language of the re-negotiations per the cover letter dated October 3, 2000.  These are also the same contracts that you are currently reviewing.

Should you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
