Thanks for the quick turnaround on that.  Any word on when we can expect this to be set for hearing?

 

work permit to dewater is approved.  I will forward a hardcopy upon
receipt.




The subject permit has been approved. Bridgeline may begin dewatering
operations at any time. The approved permit number is 20672.  The
hardcopy of the approved permit will be mailed to you this afternoon.
The permit only approves dewatering of the cavern. It does not approve
gas storage.
