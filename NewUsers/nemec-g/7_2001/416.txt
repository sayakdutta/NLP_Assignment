Chris & Chuck -- I have reviewed the draft Confidentiality Agreement in
connection with the proposed Transaction (as defined therein) and have made
some changes which I believe to be both minor and mutually beneficial.  I
have attached hereto both a clean version and a redlined version for your
review. Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Regards,
