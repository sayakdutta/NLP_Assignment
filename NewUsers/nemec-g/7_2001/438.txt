Chris,  I am fine with his revision if you are OK with the terms.




I'll call you later today about this.  I'm travelling to West Texas for the day.

Chris, 
Sorry I missed your call. 

Enron's need for protection of classified information furnished verbally is accepted. However, such information needs to be identified. Changed CA accordingly.

Hank, 

Made a couple of minor changes to the CA that incorporated yours. 
Please review and we will get you execution copies.
