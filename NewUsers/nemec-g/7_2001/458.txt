Mark,  Could you please review the attached.  The documents are for access to a commodities and derivative products online exchange.  ENA Upstream Company, LLC is the Enron entity needing access.  The last directive I received it that all these types of documents for trading platforms needed to be reviewed by you.  Let me know if I am mistaken.  Thanks.

Judy,

Can you please have either Jeff Hodge or Gerald Nemec take a look at this ASAP.  I would like to get us hooked up on this as quickly as possible.  Meaning 2 weeks ago.

Thanks,

Kathy




Please have Jeff Hodge review this agreement for Natural Gas.  This is one of our top priorities.
