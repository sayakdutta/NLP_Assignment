I have the form that we used for the Enron Amendment, but I need to see a 
copy of the original Texaco guaranty before I can finalize a form for 
Texaco.  Can you provide me a copy of the Texaco guaranty?

I have already overnighted the Enron amendment.  Where are we in 
preparation/execution of the Texaco amendment?

Hey Gerald,

Enron Corp. and Texaco Inc. currently have issued $12MM guaranties to 
Superior Natural Gas.  The obligations under the guaranties are several and 
not joint obligations.  The customer has asked that we increase these 
guaranties to $25MM.  Please prepare an amendment to the existing guaranties 
and have Enron execute a hardcopy original, delivering such copy to me at 
2860b.  And, drafting an executable Texaco copy so that I might e-mail the 
request to Texaco for signature.

Thanks for your help.
