Boy, That brings back memories.  Thanks for reminding me that I no longer 
have the joy of coming to work every day and receiving another duct tape 
nugget of wisdom.

Just when I thought I was rid of the duct tape humor, I get this........

Duct tape is like 'the force'. It has a light side & a dark side, and it
  holds the universe together.

It's not even funny, but I thought you might like it considering your
affection for the stuff.
