I am doing fine.  Work is fairly busy.  I went to Austin last weekend to see 
George.  He is engaged now and I think he will get married March of next 
year.  Met his fiance and she is really nice.  

I received Jacob's B-day invitation in the mail this week.  Please let Janice 
know that I am sorry but won't be able to come down for the Party.  I will be 
coming down for the family reunion on July 1.  I will see the kids then.  I 
guess Sharon and Will are planning on coming down for the reunion also.  I 
will probably be there late Friday night.

Take care and talk to you later

Haven't heard from you in awhile.   Is everything o.k..........We are all
fine getting some rain today from that tropical depression. Not much they
told us we would get 3to4 inches. I think they kinda blew it out of
proportion. Dad's playing cards and I'm just writing some e-mails. So how
are things going.I guess you have been busy at work. Dad went to Robstown
yesterday for a field day tour with James and he said James has some real
good crops so far. Now if he can harvest them all That will be the test.
                       Well all for now we send our love........MOM
