For completeness,  Attached are the operational documents that reflect the 
Gallup Amendments.  The Gas Price Letter reflects TW's agreement to provide 
incremental gas volumes.  The confirms to the existing Enfolio deals reflect 
the value for the gas which flows from Enron North America Corp. to Enron 
Compression Services Corp. and finally to the LLC.    The confirms done with 
the original Gallup Transaction are not being amended.  New confirms are 
being added to handle the incremental gas from TW.  Please let me know if you 
have any questions.
