This is a footnote from one of the cases you sent earlier.  Can you check on 
this for us, too.

Thanks

More on point is Texas-Ohio Pipeline, Inc., 69 FERC ?61,145 (1994), where the 
Commission issued a certificate to allow the operation of a pipeline facility 
constructed to alleviate a bottleneck between the jurisdictional services of 
two interstate pipelines.
