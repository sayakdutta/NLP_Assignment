Ken,  Attached is your document with my comments.   


 

 

Gerald,

We are in discussion with Public Service Company of Colorado about acquiring
a small gathering system just north of the Badger Wash Gas Plant.  The
attached document gives a little background of the transaction and lists
some of my questions concerning this transaction.  After you review the
document, I would like to discuss these issues with you to be sure we have
addressed all Crescendo's risks and obligations.

Thanks,

Ken Krisa
