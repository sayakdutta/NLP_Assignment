JULIA and MARY, Carol just called to say she's in a meeting that won't be finished until around noon today.  Could one of you please have someone in your group work with Veronica Espinoza on this matter.  Would you please call me to advise me which person is working on handling this request so I may advise Carol; her Blackberry is not working right now.

Thanks,
Sandy Haldeman (Ext. 53879)
