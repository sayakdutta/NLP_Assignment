Jere,  I have reviewed the draft and everything looks fine except for the $10 
million cap.  Dave and I had discussed a $2 million cap.  I would request 
that the $2 million cap be inserted.  Please let me know if you have any 
questions.

Gerald,

Enclosed is the latest version which I understand you and David N discussed.
I understand there are changes to sections 2 and 6.  Dave asked me to send
to you in his absence.  Please let us know if this is on target.
