I went to the floor with the intention of checking this guy out, but when I 
got there I felt stupid and didn't really feel the need to pursue that.  I am 
actually sorry I mentioned it to you.  Insensitive on my part.  It is not a 
huge concern to me at this point.

How is your day going?  Have you gone out of your way to talk to Cynthia yet?
