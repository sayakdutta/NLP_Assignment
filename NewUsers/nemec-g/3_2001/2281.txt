Interesting!  Did she say why she was trying to call you at home?  I don't 
care if you tell where you have been, unless you think it would make things 
awkard between you. Probably not a good idea overall though.

Cynthia just walked by me downstairs and told me that she has been trying to
call me for the past two days at home.  She said that I am never home.  Do
you think that I should tell her where I have been?

So, I guess that explains the blocked #'s that I have been getting on my
caller id!
