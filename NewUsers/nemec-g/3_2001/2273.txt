Dan,  Per our discussion, attached is the Compressor Services Agreement 
between Enron Compression Services Company  and Tennessee Gas Pipeline 
Company.  This is a rough draft at this point, but should give you a good 
idea of the structure of this deal.  Note that Section 3.4 will be removed as 
this is no longer part of the deal.
