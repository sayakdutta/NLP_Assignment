Clement,  Attached is a form of Enron Guaranty which has been marked up by 
the counterparty.  The guaranty would back to LLC which are owned by ENA to 
develop power plants.  The guaranty backs a Precedent Agreement and a long 
term firm transport agreement.  Please review the comments and let me know 
what you think.
