How was the big weekend in Vegas?  I usually don't have to much luck at 
gambling but I like to do it nonetheless.  Did you win any money on the 
fight?  I had a blast the last time I went.  We stayed at the Paris hotel.  
Very nice.  All those hotel employees saying "Bon Jeur" every 5 minutes did 
get a little tiring though.
