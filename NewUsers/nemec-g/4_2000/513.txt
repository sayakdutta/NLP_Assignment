I lost the information concerning fly fishing you left on my voice mail.  
Could you be so kind as to resend via email.  I am thinking of just taking a 
poll to see what everyone's interest are.  I personally am thinking Mountain 
Biking sounds like great fun and a super way to endanger my life.  Drop me a 
note when you get a chance.  Also what is the schedule for the get together 
on Sat.
