FYI.  I think there was a temp here the day I sent this letter out.

I received my copy of ECS's April 13 letter to TW and noticed it was 
addressed to the wrong Susan Scott.  She usually does forward me the mail she 
receives by mistake.  But since the information that we occasionally send 
each other thru interoffice mail for these compressor deals is more important 
than most, I thought I'd let you know my correct room # is 4788.  Also, when 
sending e-mail make sure you address it to Susan Scott at ET&S, not ECT.  
This will ensure I receive everything you send me.  Thanks!
