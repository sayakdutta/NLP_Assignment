Attached are the draft Confidentiality Agreements for the Colonial Pipeline 
Projects.

Please note the following:

 1.  Need address, contact, full legal name information for Flowserve.
 2.  Please review the scope (1st Paragraph) for both agreements.  Need to 
make sure I not giving the parties to little or too much information 
concerning  each others roles in this project.
 3.  The Flowserve CA is unilateral.  Only binds Flowserve to protect info we 
give them.

Please review and let me know if you have any comments or questions.
