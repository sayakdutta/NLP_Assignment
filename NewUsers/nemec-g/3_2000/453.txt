Hi Katie,   Looks like you got the address right.  I too enjoyed talking with 
you last night.  I know you were disappointed to be distracted from your 
research project for a while.  

Its been a busy week so far.  The end of the yearly quarter always is.  Last 
minute deals have to be closed to book the income.  At this time of year the 
commercial dealmakers get that wild eyed looked which says "I have got to get 
this project done or I am out of here".  March 31 can't arrive soon enough.  

Got any big plans for the weekend?  Hanging out at the Dixie Chicken or is 
that only where rookies hang out?  

Take care and I'll talk to you later.

Gerald  








Hey Gerald,
