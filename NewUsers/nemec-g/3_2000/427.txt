GT,   What's up?  Got that house in order yet?  Keeps you busy doesn't it.  
Hope everything is going well.

 I and the redfaced Eric are thinking about a road trip to Austin on the 
weekend of March 18th.  A band we really want to check out (Tenacious D) is 
playing at La Zona Rosa on Sat. the 18th.  Are you going to be around that 
weekend?  We have confirmation via some web site that Tenacious D will be 
there, but have tried calling La Zona Rosa about tix with no success.  Do you 
know anything about this place?  Are the concerts usually walk up tix sales?

Let me know what your schedule looks like.   Oh yeah, Eric's wife Jennifer 
will probably accompany him to Austin.  Eric couldn't get a hall pass for the 
weekend.
