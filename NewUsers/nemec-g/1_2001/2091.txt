You and Richard had agreed to put in the Feb 28 deadline for providing 
alternative rates in Sec 1.7 of the PA

WE are planning to add the following to the end of the 3rd sentence:

by no later than February 28, 2001. 

we need to be sure to have that information since so that decision can be 
made within the 15 day window. Otherwise, we may have less than 15 days.

Please advise.

Thanks 

Stephanie
