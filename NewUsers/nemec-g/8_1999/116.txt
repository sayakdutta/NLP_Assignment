Lillie,  You might try checking with Jack Simunek.  I am not sure there is 
any documentation on this, but he has a pretty good handle on this issue.  
Jim Coffey at one time issued a one page memo on just this subject.  Might 
also check with him.  Once we decide whether to apply this or not, putting 
this into a contract is a relatively simple matter.

Gerald,

Do you have any information on the tax gross up percentage for HPL.?  Also,  
is there an established policy for applying gross up to reimbursable 
projects?  
I have not seen any contract language for HPL projects  that address gross up 
as part of the producer's cost.  I have, however, occasionally seen gross up
included on the work order estimate. 

If you have any documentation, would you please forward to me.
