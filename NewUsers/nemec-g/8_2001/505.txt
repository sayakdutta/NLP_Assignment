Judy,  Let me visit with Jeff on the 6 month threshold for the Committed Reserves.  Otherwise I am OK with this Matrix.



 

Gerald,

When you get a second, see if the following accurately captures which confirmation template should be used with which deals.

Confirmation Usage		
		
Form	Deal Type	
GTC Firm Pooled Gas	1 - 12 months Pooled Gas	
GTC Firm Point Gas	1 - 5 months Wellhead Gas	
Committed Reserves	Producer trades > 6 months	
GISB	Day-month trades not with Producers with GISB	
GTC Spot	Day-month trades not with Producers without GISB	

Thanks,
Judy
