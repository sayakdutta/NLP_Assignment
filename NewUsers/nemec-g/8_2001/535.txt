Jean,  I have reviewed Marathon's revisions to the CA.  I agree that these changes are minor and I am OK with all of them except one.  With respect to the stricken sentence in Paragraph 7, I would ask Marathon the reason for the strike.  I think the sentence only reinforces the right to compete concept in the first sentence and further specify's the concept.  I would be happy to discuss this further with Marathon.  Thanks.
