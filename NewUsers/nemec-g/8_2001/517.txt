The only change is in Section 2.  I refer to the requirement to schedule the Daily Contract Quantity instead the Nomination.


 

In a nutshell, what changed on this version?  I haven't compared it against the old one yet.

 

Not anytime soon, but within the next couple of weeks.

 

Thanks.  Do you anticipate any more changes to this version?
