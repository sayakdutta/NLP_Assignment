David Marshall (risk management, insurance group) will be the one to set the limits.  I usually send a copy of the agreement and ask for his comments.  I can handle once we get a draft of the agreement.  





Gerald,

How should I handle this?  Is this something normally done during the legal (risk mgmt., etc.) review by someone in your group, RAC....???  

Gracias!

Dave






Dave,

I am working on the agreement now.  Please don't forget to get with Don
Rollins (at ENA) to determine  the insurance and the limits we will require
the operating company to carry.
Thx

Ken
