Thanks for the email.  We are expecting you on Monday the 2nd.  Everything should be set up.  I believe you have to see HR the morning you start to get your ID badge, but they should send you to us thereafter shortly.  Give me a call if you need any help with anything.  (713) 853-3512.

 



Hi Gerald,

I hope that things have gone well with your first set
of law clerks.  I was writing to confirm that I will
be starting work for you next Monday, July 2.  I have
been trying to contact the HR representative that I
spoke with initially, but she hasn't returned my
calls.  I just wanted to make sure that everything was
set for me to begin working.

I also wanted to let you know that I heard from the
HBA about the photograph you recommended me for.  I
wanted to thank you for remembering me.  I think that
will be a great opportunity for me.

If you need to contact me, my phone number is
713-523-4723
or my mobile is 281-814-9934.

Sincerely,

Alisha Mahabir
