  We flew into Shanghai and explored for 2 days.  Next we went to Qingdao for 3 days and finally spent 5 days in Beijing.  I would have to say that Beijing was the highlight of the trip.  The Great Wall was pretty incredible.  Should have some pics shortly.   

Work is going well! Way to busy for my taste.  That's what I get for being out of the office for two weeks.  I got a voice mail from Mark while I was in China.  He was at the airport here in Houston looking for a ride.  Typical Mark.  Any plans on coming to Houston anytime?

Gerald, glad to hear that you had a wonderful time in China.  What cities
did you visit?  If you have any pics on the web let me know.

Austin still treating me well.  I could complain but it would not help.
Work is keeping me busy and I am entering triathlon season, helping my
brother run the restaurant and working on a new relationship.   A girl has
to keep her plate full! ;o)
What about you?  How is the law?  Dave told me about his new Colombian
connection!

Later, Patricia





Hi Pat,  Fortunately I was out of the country when all the flooding
occurred and my house sustained no damage.  Just spent two weeks in China
and the sights were pretty amazing.  How are things in Austin?


    
   



         

   Dave  and Gerald,

   I just  wanted to say hi and see how you were doing.  Did the flood give
   you any  problems?  I hope all is well.

   Thanks,
