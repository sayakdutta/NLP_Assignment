Debra Perelingiere had prepared this contract.  Since it was done so recently, it may not have made it into the system yet. Thanks for your help.  I'll check Debra's files.

 

I can't find anything for Kaztex with that date.  There are some Firm GTCs, but not with that date.  Keep looking?

 

Thanks.  Could you also look for a Enfolio Master Firm with Kaztex Energy Management Inc. and ENA dated August 1, 2001.

 

Here you go!
