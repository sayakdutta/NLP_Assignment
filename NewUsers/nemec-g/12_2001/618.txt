Thanks Susan.  Can you send me any GTC that would have been for Nov -01 through March 02 business for PGW.

 

PGW has only GTCs.  Here are the Husky files.

In addition to the Philadelphia Gas Works contracts, could you also look for a Husky Oil Operations Limited with ENA dated September 1, 1999.  Thanks.
