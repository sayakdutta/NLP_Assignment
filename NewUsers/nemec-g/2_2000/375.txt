Las Vegas was alot of fun.  The weather was awesome.  In the 60s with clear 
skies.  However, I had no luck at gambling.  The cards just weren't falling 
for me in Black Jack.

Yes, a friend of mine from Enron is moving back to Houston from Portland, so 
this is working out great.  Very close to getting the divorce finalized.  
Should be done in a week or two.  Talk to you later and hope all finds you 
well.  









Hi Gerald,      How's it going?  Fine I hope. We are all O.K. It"s been cold
the last few days. So you are going to have a roommate.  That ought to help
you out a lot, plus you"ll have some company. I heard you went to Las Vegas
over the weekend. Did you have fun. How much did you win .  Was the weather
cold or not. Talked to Paul Saturday and he said you went there. So is there
any progress on your divorce or not. Let us know what is happening. Well all
for now Dad and I send our love.    Love  Mom.
