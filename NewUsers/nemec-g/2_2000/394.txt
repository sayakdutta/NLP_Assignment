It is all about drinking with you isn't it?  You need to get a grip.   I will 
have to pass on the Rudz Suds as I will be dining at one of Houston's finer 
eateries with captains of industry tonight.  However, Eric and I were kicking 
around a possible road trip to the beautiful island of Galveston this 
weekend.  Saturday or Sunday? Think that nice friend of yours, Willis, might 
be interested? 

Please respond appropriately with your level of interest!  Just to anticipate 
the tone of your response, I will go ahead and call you a "Smart Ass" right 
now.

Possible suds and tunes for this eve if anyone is down.

OUT!
