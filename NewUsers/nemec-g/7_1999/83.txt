Paul,  We need to plan on getting together sometime.  When and how long are 
you going to be in San Diego once you get back from stomping out the "angry 
red horde"?  Might be an opportune time to hook up.  I would love to see Papa 
Bieraugel in action and I'm not referring to your Dad.

CARE...HI TO LISA.  pAUL.
