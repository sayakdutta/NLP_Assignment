A note from Bieraugel.  We need to go out and see these guys when we get a 
chance.  

Hang in there.  Things will start to come around, it is just going to take 
some time.

Gerald, Michele will be in San Diego starting Nov this year.  I won't be
back from the Gulf until March 20, 2000.  I'll be there for around two
years...then....we'll see.  I'm considering leaving the Navy.  not sure yet.
You and Lisa are always welcome.  Just let us know or just jet out for the
weekend whatever works.  Hi to Lisa.  Paul.
