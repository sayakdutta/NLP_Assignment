Rod, I think we have a "clean" ETS approval authorization (umbrella) policy for both commitments and fulfullments/execution.
Now what? Send out under your name as final? Send to the BUCs/others a review? Any preference?

 

 

Please see the attached with the changes we discussed with Rod - (the Commitment and Fulfillment version) and other changes you suggested.

Note, they are under separate tabs.
