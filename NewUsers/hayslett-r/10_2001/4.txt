It is not necessary.    Other than Tracy, he would be the only one of the accounting and finance people there and Stan is trying to limit the attendance to the group necessary for the discussions.

 

Rod and Kathy:

I just spoke with our travel agent, and we can make Jerry's flight reservations tomorrow (Tuesday).  Please let me know - sometime on Tuesday - if Jerry needs to attend the Plan Review with Mr. Lay on November 8.

Thanks!

Dee


 

Hi, Rod:

Sorry to be such a pain about this, but we're trying to finalize Jerry's flights so he can obtain the discount fare.  (Needs to be ticketed today.)

Please advise asap.

Thanks, Rod.

Dee


 

Rod:

We initially asked Mr. Cordes about this.  His reply was that Jerry should check with you.  Sounds like Mr. Cordes is seeking your insight.  Based upon this, please let us know your final thoughts.

Thanks again.

Dee


 

Not needed unless Bill Cordes has asked him to attend.   In which case let me know, because we are monitoring the attendance list closely.

Good morning, Rod:

As you know, there is a Plan Presentation with Mr. Lay on Thursday, November 8.  FYI, Jerry Peters will be in Houston for other meetings on Thursday morning, and we are trying to determine if Jerry is expected to attend the Plan Review.  If so, I will schedule Jerry for a later flight departure from Houston that day.

Please let us know your thoughts at your earliest convenience.

Thanks, Rod.
