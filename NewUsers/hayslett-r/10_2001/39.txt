In the covenants of the debt agreements.     If it's not a test in the lenders package, then it is not in the deal.

 

Is there a definition of Consolidated Minimumu Tangible Net Worth to work from?

 

These would be in the debt tests performed for the lenders.    Do you know the answers?

 

Rod - do you know the answer to the question below?

Drew,

Can you confirm that Transwestern has a Consolidated Minimum Tangible Net Worth of $250 million and that Northern Natural does not have a Minimum TNW covenant?

Thanks,

David
