I am going to begin discussions with the banks as soon as we get the Phase 5 financing locked down.     I would expect that we could have it in another month, unless I run into some kind of a buzz-saw out there, and I'll let you know as soon as I do.




Rod,

When can we count on the dividend?  From El Paso's perspective; the sooner
the better.

Thx.

Greg
