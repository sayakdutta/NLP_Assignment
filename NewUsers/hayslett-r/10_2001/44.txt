I guess I need some more definition.    If I am creating a new group and I have nobody in it, this doesn't make sense.    Can I get some definitions to go over this with Stan?   I am having some trouble with this concept, I guess, as it doesn't appear to make any sense.    Why wouldn't we give these groups 0 authority since we don't use them.   I also think we need to make some changes to the rest of the schedule.    Especially at the top.

Lisa,

Attached is the Spend/Approvals amounts for the new HR job groups that have recently been created and the most recent HR structure file that I received from Lessa Hutcherson in HR.  I inserted in red the Spend/Approval amounts that we discussed for the new groups.  Currently we have no employees in any of these new groups.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks

Jeff
