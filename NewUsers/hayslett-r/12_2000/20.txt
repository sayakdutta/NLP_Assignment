Rod,

After receiving feedback from both yourself and Phil Lowry through George 
Wasaff, we will cancel this meeting. Originally Peter Buettgen and I were  
anticipating the need to share the details of our process assessment strategy 
with you prior to our kickoff. However, it has been pointed out that Morris 
has been identified as the lead player and has responsibility for all 
decision making. Therefore we will be working directly with Morris and will 
not burden you with details unless Morris feels appropriate.

Thank you for your support and commitment in the completion of the iBuyit 
process assessment.
John
