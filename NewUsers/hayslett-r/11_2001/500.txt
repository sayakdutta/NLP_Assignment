As you can see in the attachment below, this is an extremely exhaustive list of questions/requests (for NNG only).  I would strongly suggest that we meet for one hour to go over this list and prepare for Thursday's meeting.

Kevin,

Attached is our detailed due diligence request list for Northern Natural.
The list is not 100% complete.  I am awaiting input from our operations

Please call if you have any questions (713/767-4764).

Regards,

Kyle
