That is understood.    He will be taking Glisan's position which had the same restrictions on it.    I don't plan on giving him any data other than daily cash positions and forecasted cash positions.   There would be no purpose in giving him E&F data. 

By the wya, Kevin needs to do the Marketing Affiliate stuff.

Rod,

There is a pending proposal to make Ray Bowen VP of Finance and Treasury.
They also want to give him a similar position on the marketing affiliates.
I just wanted to make sure that the pipelines will not give him E and F data.
Do you know how that what kind of data, if any, the pipelines will be giving to him?
