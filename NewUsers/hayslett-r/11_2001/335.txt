I want to make sure that we are looking out for our people at this point in time.    If there is someone who is having a particular problem, now is a time to be comforting.   I also want to make sure that we are doing everything in our power to reduce spending.   If you have a vacancy, now may be the time to consider do you really have to fill that job right now.
