Maricela: Would you please coordinate with someone at Bracewell regarding wire transfer information to have paid today the following legal bills with respect to time through today:

(1) Bracewell: $950,000
(2) Shearman & Sterling: $265,000
(3) Davis, Polk: $185,291.59
(4) Local Counsel (to be designated as such, but wired to Bracewell): $60,000.

I'm sure there is more to follow (ie. Delaware counsel)
Let me know if you have any questions.
Thanks.
