Please find attached file. Transportation & Storage Revenue is right off the Earning Model Income Statement. Carlton data can be found in the Commercial Function detail within the "Database" worksheet of the Earning Model. The Cash Flow verbiage is very general related to the subject matter, but does provide a business reason on a Direct Cash Flow basis for an item buried within the Indirect Cash Flow format. Call me if you have any further questions and I will attempt to get you through them.    I can also get you set up to get even more detailed answers if you would like.
