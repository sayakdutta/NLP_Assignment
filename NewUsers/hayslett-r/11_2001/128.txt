Thanks.




Frequency or incident rates are calculated as follows:

Lost Time = no. of incidents x 200,000/total no. man hours worked

Recordable= same as above.  There are individual recordable cases and ALL lost time incidents are counted as "one" lost time and "one" recordable.  In other words every LT adds one to LT and one to Recordables.

Vehicle Frequency= no. of accidents x 1,000,000/total miles driven.
