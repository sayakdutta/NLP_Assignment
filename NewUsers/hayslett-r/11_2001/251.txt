As you know, the Enron Global Services Special Staff Meeting is scheduled for Thursday, Nov. 15 from 8:30 - 1:00 in 5c2.  

If you are planning to use a powerpoint presentation for your business unit overview, could I get that presentation by 5:00pm Tuesday, Nov. 13?  Once I have your presenation, we can get it ready for display at the meeting.

Thanks for your immediate attention.  Please call me with questions.
