UH Team:

I have just been notified that the UH On Campus Recruiting is being resched=
uled due to scheduling conflicts with both UH and Enron.  Once we determine=
 the new dates, I'll forward an email to the team.

I apologize for any inconvenience that this may have caused and hope that y=
ou will be able to participate in the future.
