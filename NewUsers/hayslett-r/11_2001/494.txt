I have asked and will let you know the answer later today.    The bigger question is that they can not loan money to Enron and can only dividend, so if they can do something to raise the cash, they still can't get it out any more out than they can by dividending.    The other problem is that they are running into cash problems themselves since they were in the process of going to the bond markets when all of this occurred, and were advised to wait.   Their receivables from California are part of the problem.   More update later.

 

Hey! Just a reminder to check on the Portland General inventory.
