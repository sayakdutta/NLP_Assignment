Rod,
     I had approved an offsite Happy Hour for our Market Services Group following our string of emergencies (about a $2500-$3000 expenditure).  Considering everything that has happened, we're reviewing all costs, whether previously approved or not, and cutting where we can.  This is one that I don't think I should pull unless you feel strongly that I should.  Let me know your thoughts.
