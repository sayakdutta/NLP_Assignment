Can you help us here?
   
For Mariella and Jeff:    Has this divestiture been to RAC?  It will need to go, and probably sonner rather than later.

 

I have a quick question here:

In the LOI with the GoPhil., parties are required to show BoDirectors approval for the transaction.  This transaction will net to Enron approx. $100 million.  This is a divestiture and I don't know how we are handling approvals for that.  Can you help me understand the approval process and whether given such the Dec 1 deadline will be an issue?  I would think not but wanted to check.
Thanks
