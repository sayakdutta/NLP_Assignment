Are these any of our floors?

 


During a recent review of Enron's High-rise Fire Evacuation Plan, the City of Houston Fire Department noted that several of our floors did not have the required number of trained Fire Wardens.

I need your help.  If you are a full-time Enron employee, please consider being a Fire Warden for your floor.  Newly designated Fire Wardens must complete a two-hour certification training sponsored by the Fire Marshall's Office on Thursday, Nov. 15.

Please contact Monica Rodriquez (x35393) or Harry Grubbs (x35417) to participate as an Enron Fire Warden.

Thank you for your commitment to safety in our workplace.
