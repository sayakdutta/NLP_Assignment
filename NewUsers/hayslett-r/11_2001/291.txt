I would like each of you to help take ownership of this project to be fully able to explain the trends on these sheets.   I would also like to begin to add 2001 3rd CE to this discussion as soon as possible.   Accounting quite possibly has the answers, but I want to get this documented as soon as possible so that we understand the changes and don't have to go back and do this again.   This is not a project that will be complete by friday, but it does need to get complete this year.

 

starting point, okay?
if possible, please indicate line items you woul like us to "drill down" on
