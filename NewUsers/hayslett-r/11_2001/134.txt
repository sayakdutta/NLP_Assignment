To the best of my knowledge, there are no market studies or other documents that have been prepared that appear to meet the requirements of 4c

Drew: Can you think of anything we may have done while you were in Omaha that might fit this request? 


Cc: Eickenroht, Robert




Attached is a Memorandum put together by Robert Eickenroht requesting Item 4(c) documents in connection with Project Notre Dame. This information is required for our HSR filing.  The request includes all documents prepared internally and by outside advisors.  I will follow up with JPMorgan and SSB, but I will need your help on the internal piece.

Please forward this request as you see necessary and forward the 4(c) documents to me or to Robert directly.

The HSR filing is Tuesday so we need your information quickly.

Thank you for your help.
