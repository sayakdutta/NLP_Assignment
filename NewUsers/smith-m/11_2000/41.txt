Pablo, 

Have we made any progress on finding out why the Northwest website is not 
accessible before 7 am?  For your reference the error message is below.  

The address is http://www.1line.williams.com/webbi/ebb/main.

 

Error 500--Internal Server Error 
From RFC 2068 Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.1:
10.5.1 500 Internal Server Error
The server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from 
fulfilling the request.


Thanks.

Mat
