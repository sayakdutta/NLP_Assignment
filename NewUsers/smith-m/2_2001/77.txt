Hey Anna,

Sorry, I took awhile getting back to you....I took the week off...

Ya, we tried meeting up, but I guess you guys must have left before we got 
there.  Our dinner at Sambuca's took quite awhile, I think we made it to 
Deans around 12:30 or so.  We checked there and the Hub, but no luck.  Hope 
you guys had a good time, and I'm always up for another night out.

Matt- I don't know if you remember me, but we met at Jennifer's party at the
Black Lab.  Thought we were meeting up with y'all last Sat, night, but I
guess we missed each other.  Maybe we can try it again sometime soon.  Hope
you had a fun night without us :)

Hello!  OK, for those of you who can make it (and I hope it will be all of

Prairie) at 7:30 PM.  So, if you can make it to dinner, please come at 7:30
and we will reserve a big table.  If you can't make it to dinner, come to
El Tiempo for a margarita and then we will head over to Dean's after that.
Hope to see you all there!  And please feel free to invite others!  JB

If you need to reach me, my cell phone # is 713-417-8613.
