As a matter of fact, mark your damn calender......March 8-11....I'm in town 
and will hopefully be attending the Big Championship game Sat.. night, 
otherwise just partying.  Again, you name the time and place, and whoever 
else might be interested in "getting it done".  How's the residency going?  
Enron kicks ass, but I feel like it's going to take me forever to get where I 
need to be, and you won't believe where that is, but more on that later.  Go 
Syracuse.
