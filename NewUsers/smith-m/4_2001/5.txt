Mike,

Sorry I missed you guys Friday night.  I made back from a golf outing around 
9 pm, but you guys must have already left the Front Porch.  Anyway,  I was 
out the other night and met some Dynegy talent that were interested in an 
Enron Analyst/Associate and Dynegy Pace Program happy hour.  What do you 
think about the prospectsof a combined happy hour.  They have a group that 
goes out on the third Thursday of every month, which would be this Thursday.

Mat
