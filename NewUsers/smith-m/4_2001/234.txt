Patti,

Chris said you had problems gettting to the manual entry website.  The link is http://fundamentals.dev.corp.enron.com/admin/manualentry/

Socal Manual Entry is the correct pipeline to choose (a slight change from Socal).  Also, we need to start entering the Clay basin numbers under the Questar Manual Entry pipeline, however, Chris Hyde is working to set up the page so that a delivery and a receipt value can be entered.
