why can't you go, or do you just not want to?








Smith,
    Do you have any interest in this concert?   Matchbox Twenty, Life House,
and some other band....  I have a ticket and I don't know if I am going, but
if you want to go I can see if she has an extra ticket or you can have mine.
Let me know!

Hey gang - just a reminder I have you guys down for the concert on Wed.,
April 11th.  That's the week after next.  If, for any reason, you can't make
it, let me know and I will get some other takers for the tickets.  Thanks!
