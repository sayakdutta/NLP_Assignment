you just want my address...2125 Sul Ross, Houston, TX, 77057....




I washed your sock.  Would you like me to send it to you?  If so, I need an
address.




Oh yes, it was a good contest.  Gannon is quite the quarterback.  Did
you?  I only watched the first half, though, because I was tired and
went to bed.  Today, I'm watching our stock go to shit once again.  It's
only a matter of time before we shut the doors.  I think the only thing
that will keep us from going under is that the industry would get hurt
too much.  Maybe the government will bail us out.  Anwyay, how's
everything with you?
 




Did you have some football-loving fun last night?
