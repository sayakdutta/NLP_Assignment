Sounds like a trick question...Obviously, you would take offence to me answering "no" for any reason at all.  However, I generally don't truly like people who I work with for whatever reason.  Though, if I answer "yes", it might imply that I don't like you now because you do not work at Enron, and somehow make you wish you did.  So....the answer is that it would be cool if someone i liked happened to work in close proximity (as long as it isn't too close), but who i like is regardless of employment.....






If i worked at your work, would you like me?
