Kristen,

I thought Mark had called you, but I guess not.  He said that he can't have 
Wendy and Amy change their plans, so he can't go on the ski trip.  It was 
pathetic....I heard, "so, are you guys still planning on coming that 
weekend?...well good...."  He proceeded to talk for at least two hours on the 
phone, and just mentioned the outcome yesterday.  I pushed him to give me 
details, but all he said was the cost was a major factor and that Wendy had 
time off.  I think he was bullshiting and that he never really asked them 
(I'm such a skeptic).  Anyway, fuck'm.  Any ideas?

Mat     











Hey cutie, I just spent forever writing you a nice little reply to your
email on the ski trip, my email availibility, phone b.s, your NYC trip and
Scully, all to have this piece of shit freeze up....so I think perhaps I
will just try to get some time to call you tonight!!!!
love, k

You should now have checks from myself, Duncan and Bill.  Sharon said she
would get back to me today, but I think we should jump on this lodge asap.
