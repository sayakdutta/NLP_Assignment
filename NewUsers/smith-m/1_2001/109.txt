Sara,

Yo, what's up?  How are things across the street?  Let me guess, you got all 
rested up saturday and sunday, then when out three nights already this week, 
and now are ready to go home, do laundry and sleep.  Unfortunately, I've been 
extremely lame, mostly because you got me sick...well maybe not.  Anyway, I 
haven't been feeling so hot, yet I did oversleep by two hours this morning 
which really helped.  Poor Ted had to pick the slack.  So, any big plans for 
the weekend besides laundry?  Superbowl?  Happy hour?  Toilet flushing into 
the phone?  Stupid drunk?  

Mat
