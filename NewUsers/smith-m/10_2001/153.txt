Hey,
Please send me Mat Smith's email.  I need to send him an email to get
him motivated to make the Whistler trip and I wanted to get his email
from you anyway.

I'll do a little more research on pricing.  For now tell him this:

Dates: arrive March 2nd and leave March 9th
Lodging:  $400 - $800 per person for 7 nights for 1 bdrm w/ kitchen,
walking dist. to lifts
Airfare:  $0 - $500 or so
Lift tickets:  $200-$250 for 6 tickets
Ground Trans.:  $60-$80 round trip from Vancouver to Whistler on shuttle

Food & drink:  ???, but the exchange rate is kicking ass at 1:1.55 and
the places we are looking at have a full kitchen with a fridge to hold
plenty of Molson

5000 ft of vertical and the best mountain base night life around, how
can you pass this up?

Later,

Brooks
