right now, i'm leaning towards no, but my friend Kristen isn't being very cooperative about getting back to me.  thanks for keeping me apprised of the situation.

 


Let me know if you think you are going to go with us.  I have a college friend that may come up with a girl friend of hers.  Probably make room for them even if you do go but I just want to let her know.

Hope all is well
