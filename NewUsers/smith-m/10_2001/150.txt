Zo,

What's up my brother?  Long time no speak.  I just got your email from Scotty P (somehow he found me).  Anyway,  I'd like to give you  a call sometime and catch up, so definitely send me your number.  I don't know if you knew, but I moved back to Houston again for a job with Enron.  I've been here over a year now working on the natural gas floor.  Life is good, but nothing real exciting to report.  So, I just realized that next weekend is homecoming.  Any chance that anyone is going?  I wasn't planning on it, but if a bunch of people were going I could still get a cheap flight into Ithaca, but I'd have to buy it today.  If you wouldn't mind, send me a quick email to let me know if anyone is going....

Well, since I hope to talk to you soon...that's it.

Hope all is well.

Mat
