sorry, this is taking a while...




Hey,

What are you doing?  Have you taken  a lunch.  I already ate, but I need to
take a break.  Maybe we could rendezvous?  Let me know.




Since i'm logged in to this computer i can get mail, so if the phone
doesn't work, just send me a quick email...

Hope you're feeling better today, and that bitch doesn't give you any
shit!

He Mat,

I just realized that I can't call your cell number from my work phone.
I
don't know if you are going to get this, but my work number is 503
219-8757.
Or, I will try and call you at home so pick up the phone at my house.

Laurel
