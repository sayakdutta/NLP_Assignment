Hey, I think I lost your work number.  Can you send me it or give me a call at work.

Mat




No, this woman that I work with informed me that in the beginning it was the
goat.  Why she needed to share this with me I don't know.  What do goats and
fraternities have to do with one another?  I am not familiar with the goings
on of fraternities.  Did you have some sort of run in?  Do you need to
share?




goat?  i think that's only true for fraternity pledges.




What?  You didn't like that story.  You know it wasn't my idea, I was
coerced into the closet.  Ok, that doesn't sound very good.  I just
found
out that the goat was originally man's best friend.  Interesting eh?




No foreced drinking, just one ceremonial shot of tequilla.  I think
they're saving it up for this weekend.  I think we're having a party on
Saturday.  I don't know if we have any closet shelves that I can fit
into, though.....




Did people try and force glasses of alcohol on you just because it's
your
birthday?  That is always nice.  Sometimes it seems like other people
are
way more excited that it's your birthday than you are, and they just
really
want you to party.  I don't know, I am rambling.  I was up kind of late
and
so this morning I am a little slow.  




More like 50 cents.....Canadian that is.




Hi there,

How are you feeling?  Like a million dollars or more like .50 cents?
