Hey,

Nice to hear from you.  No, I haven't done much celebrating yet.  Just work work work.  Anyway, ya, I still want to come up sometime, it's just a little less inviting than it used to be.  When is a good time now?  I'm going to Portland in two weeks for a couple of days, but pretty much free after that.  By the way, my NEW address is 2125 Sul Ross Rd., Houston, TX 77098.  Anyway, let's chat sometime... Talk to you soon.

Hey Cutie,

Thought I would wish my boy a happy happy birthday!  Hope you had a great 
one!  Was up all night last night with a huge project proposal thing, kept 
meaning to set aside a few minutes to call you and do the b-day wishing 
then, but before I knew it it was 3am!!!!  So, what did you do to celebrate?

So this is the weekend you had thought about coming to Bean-Town.  Just  
wanted to check in and see what your plans were.........                  
Miss You,   K            ps-What is your address again?
