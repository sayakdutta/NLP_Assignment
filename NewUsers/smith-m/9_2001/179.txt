Maria,

Try these...

GDP-ELPO/SANJUA
GDP-ELPO/PERM2
GDP-SOCAL

I'm still working on those other curves.

Hi Matt,
I need to pull some daily gas settlement prices from the Oracle database in Houston.  I'm looking for El-Paso San Juan, El-Paso Permian and Topock.  Do you know the codes those for those points?  
Thanks,
Maria
