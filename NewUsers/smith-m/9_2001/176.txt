Anne,

Actually, I'm not sure whether I want Gas Daily Index's or Physical Index's...Gas Daily preferably.  A list or the file you use would be great.  Thanks.

Sure I can have Carole give you a list, or show you the file we use to load the index curves.  I assume you mean physical index.



 

Anne,

Hey, do you know where i might get a list of the curve codes in the Oracle database for west index curves?
