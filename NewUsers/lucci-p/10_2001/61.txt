When I first saw the picture I did think it had a chance of being real, until everyone else said it was a knock off.  I was a little puzzled as to how anyone found the camera.  So at least I had my doubts.  So you want to stay in Calgary another year?




I hope you didn't buy it the first time around.  

We've been having meetings the last couple of days on our Canadian Hunter acquisition.  It's all very exciting.  It will probably mean I
stay here a little longer which is good with me.  I have more friends here now than I did when I was in Houston so I'd like to stay a while
longer.

I'm going home for my 15 year high school reunion this weekend - should be interesting.

What's new with you?




That's funny I saw that original picture and was wondering what the hell
was ging on.  We thought it was BS.  Now I know.  What have you been up
to?
