Looks like you and I will hang out and wait for Will.  I told Mike we will be at the airport so we can pick everyone up who comes in around these times.  Are you getting these emails?
 
 
 
 



Guys,


Gonzalo was planning on picking up Paul and I think Rob's going to pick up Will,
perhaps you might want to consolidate and have 1 person pick up both Paul & Will, just
a thought.

I'm just throwing this out as an idea, but you guys work out all the details.  I have to be home between
1:00 - 4:00 for the margarita machine delivery, so I won't be able to pick anyone up.
