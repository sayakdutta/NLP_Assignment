Jay,
 
We are looking to transact with this customer on a two year index purchase.  I need to discuss the details with you, but in the mean time here are the financials that they have provided.  Take a close look at them and realize this is a very rich man and he can have very bad things done to you.  So, let's keep that in mind when we are working through all the credit requirements.
