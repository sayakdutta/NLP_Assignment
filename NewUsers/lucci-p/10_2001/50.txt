That party on Saturday night sounds fun.  I've got plans Friday but nothing on Saturday.  Is this the friend that was dating all those guys while she is married?




Things are good....busy as usual.  Let me know about lunch.  If you 
are not busy this weekend, its Corinnes b-day and we are having a 
party over at the Hunters Glen Clubhouse where I live on Saturday 
night with about 60 people, so let me know if you are free.
Have a good night.
