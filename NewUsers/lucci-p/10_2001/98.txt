No, Mark is going to Portland, and he just left.  You got our picks on Friday right?  I also need Karen Taylor's phone number, she's hot for me again.  I rally like her little assistant Laura.




7 people out 1 didn't send a pick at all, 5 picked Indy, and 1 picked
Jacksonville.  We now have 19 left.  Bob  Hey are you going to go to
Portland?




Hey what's up?  How many people picked the Colts this weekend?  I talked
to Todd Gilcrease I guess he's back.  And this time without Kimery.
