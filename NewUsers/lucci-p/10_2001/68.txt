My mom is having a party.  She has this party every year, the average age of the party goers is about 60.  At least I can get drunk on my mom nickel.






THe A&M game is this coming weekend.  What is going on in SA?

What weekend?  I will be in San Antonio, TX from 10/12-10/15.  So if
it's this weekend I'll be out of town.  But, if not let's party!





I will be coming in next week for the Texas A&M/CU game.  Are you up for
going to it??  THere is a group of us that get together for the game and
party afterwards.
