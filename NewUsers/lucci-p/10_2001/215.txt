I have a customer in town Thursday night, so we will be taking him out to dinner, than to the Nuggets game.  I still want, and I'm planning, to go to the concert on Friday night, so don't count me out.  We will have to do dinner some other time.  Make sure we talk on Friday because I have an open house from 3:00 to 6:00, and I'll start drinking and forget the plans.  How is everything else going.  I had a GREAT time on Saturday night, so I hope you did also.

Hi  Paul. How are you?  Just trying to plan the rest of my week.  Are we still on for dinner?  I've got my final flag-football game tonight, happy hour tomorrow night, and the 38-Special concert on Friday night, so Thursday night is the only night that really works for me.  Do you still want to go to the concert Friday?  Yes, the puker will be there!  Let me know.  Bye for now.
