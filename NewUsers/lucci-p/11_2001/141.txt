Carole,

Wow you are really bringing me down!  No I don't feel uncomfortable giving you my information.  I do want you to know that you have always been a pleasure to work with and I hope we can continue working together in the future.  If you get some time off, hopefully time off with pay, come to Denver and I'll take you skiing!

email  I need to get it fixed, I've been receiving everything here at work.

 

This may be too early, but just in case....I will save the good-byes until they become absolutely necessary.

Could I have your outside e-mails and possibly your phone #'s?  If you feel uncomfortable giving these to me, that is o.k.  The following is my information.
