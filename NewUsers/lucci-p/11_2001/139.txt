Now here is fine one!



Paul, 
Thanks for writing, This is definitely a source for amusement. I too have been playing with this for a short time (about a week). I don't use my computer that often in my work, so I'm kind of new at this stuff. I don't even know how to put my picture in my profile. 
      Sometimes I think I moved to the sleepiest town in Colorado. Everytime I tell someone where I live they say "Superior? Where's That?" 
My favorite Italian Restaurant is in Broomfield, Original Pizza on Midway. Have you been there? 
Yeah lets meet. A drive around the city sounds great and a drink always  helps. 
Wait, How do I know your not the freakish type that might try and take advantage of me. After all, you know this city better than I do. Humm, This Could be Trouble. 
Why don't you give me a call and I can try to size you up on the phone.

                                                      Anne.
