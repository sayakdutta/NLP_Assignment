I promise.  In fact why don't you and Bob take us to the Rio on Friday so we can drink, I mean forget about our troubles.




Glad to here it! 

This may sound a little dramatic, but if there's anything I can do to help
you , please count on me to help.   You've been a terrific friend to me a
time when I really needed help this past year.  You're not the type of
person who expects a lot in return, but always know your generosity was...as
is...appreciated.   You're a good person.    (Regardless of what the rest of
the industry thinks of you!!!)        ...............just kidding.

Thanks for all your help and promise you'll call on me if you ever need help
in the future.

The latest at Enron is Business as usual.  At least that's what they
want us to believe.  I think we will be effected eventually, but it will
take time for Dynegy to figure out what they have.  I don't think
anything will change for us until at least the middle of next year.
Hopefully they send some of these Enron directors to jail!

Nothing new with me.  I've got pictures of Robin, she's the girl you met
at the Rock Bottom in Broomfield, I think you should see!





Hey Looch!!

Funny e-mail.   What's the latest at Enron?   Have you heard anything
that
could affect your status here in the Denver office?  I sure hope
not....unless its good news of course.

Jared is done with football and has already moved onto basketball.   His
first game was last night in Limon.   We lost 45-27 but I think his team
has
potential.   They should do ok.

What's new with you?
