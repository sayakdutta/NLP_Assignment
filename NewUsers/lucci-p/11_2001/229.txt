After I got you message I blew off the trip downtown.  Instead I watched football and worked around the house.  I was able to get a couple things done that have been left undone for awhile, so it was worth it.  You are leaving town for a couple of weeks?  Where are you going?  I'm free every day except Wednesday.




Hi Paul, sorry I bailed on you yesterday.  Did you find any good deals?  When can I get you your ski pass?  I'm leaving town for a couple of weeks starting Saturday, so let me know.  I'll talk to you later.
