Are you up for a couple of drinks after work?  I have to tell you I had a dream about you last night.  YES, you were a cowboy!  I rode you like a...Just kidding!  No the real story is you decided on a new "look".  You showed up in wranglers, boots and hat, and best of all a RED flannel shirt!  It was hilarious.  OK, OK it was just a dream, and I won't tell anyone.
