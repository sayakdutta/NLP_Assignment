Yeah, let's do lunch on Thursday!  Who are you going on your vacation with?  




Yeah, I'm taking off on a road trip to California.  We're planning to go to Lake Tahoe, then down into Sacramento and San Fransisco for a couple of days, then off to wine country, and back down the coast, finally stopping in Vegas on the way back.  Should be a blast!  I soooo need a vacation. Would you like to go to lunch on Thursday?  I can come down town.  I have a meeting up north at 2:00 so that would work well for me.

After I got you message I blew off the trip downtown.  Instead I watched football and worked around the house.  I was able to get a couple things done that have been left undone for awhile, so it was worth it.  You are leaving town for a couple of weeks?  Where are you going?  I'm free every daye xcept Wednesday.




Hi Paul, sorry I bailed on you yesterday.  Did you find any good deals?  When can I get you your ski pass?  I'm leaving town for a couple of weeks starting Saturday, so let me know.  I'll talk to you later.
 
Lisa
