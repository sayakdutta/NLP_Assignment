I just hung out yesterday and worked around the house and watched football.






Yea you sent that one out and I actually have had it sent to me before!

Whats up!  Today I am feeling tired...Did you do anything yesterday!  I
think I need a complete week of detox in order to feel normal?  I actually
ran the last two days but instead of the comfort feeling I just feel ache!
I hate mon and tuesday because they are such long ass day10-8?  Well at
least the game is on tonight!
Later
