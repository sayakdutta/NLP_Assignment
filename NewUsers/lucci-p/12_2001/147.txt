Hell No!  Ever since last weekend when you made up some bogus excuse about having to celebrate Natalie's birthday and not being able to party with me, I've been sulking!  What's up for the weekend.  Here's what I have going on; Friday Night-Office Christmas Party, Saturday Night-Hot Tubing with random chicks (any interest?).




You don't call, you don't write...are you over me???
