Hi,

I did make the cut and I'm one of the three, in fact I've got to stay around for a certain period of time before Enron will let me go.  I think I'll stay put through the holidays and then see what happens during the first part of January.  I hope your flight went well!  It looks like the weather will be nice on Friday and cold and snowy on Saturday.  Enjoy your time on the slopes and I'll talk to you soon.

Paul





Hey-- 

Well, as far as I know, the phone number works! :-)  Talking next week would be fine. I'll be back in Philly as of Sun evening. ie: EST, 2 hours ahead of Denver :-) 

I'm not sure if I should be offering my congratulations or not, you failed to mention whether you were one of the 3 who made the final cut... regardless, you sound like you're hanging in there. 

I'm sitting in the airport, on my way home and thrilled to be doing so. 

Talk to you later! 

Steph 



Hey,

Thanks for the phone number, I hope it works! It's a little crazy for me this weekend also. Why don't I call you during the first part of next week and see if we can set something up. What time zone will you be in?

As far as the job goes, three in this office made the final cut. So we are waiting around for our next set of orders. I'll explain more later. Take care.

Paul
