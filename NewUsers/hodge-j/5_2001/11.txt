I still need to get with you.  I will be out Monday afternoon, but could meet any other afternoon next week.  The job change has been invigorating and very enjoyable.  I really appreciate this opportunity.  Let me know when you are available.

John, thanks for your review.  I have completed the form and at you convenience we can get together and put it to bed.  Let me know when.

Thanks
