I recently faxed you a power of attorney for execution on behalf of Enron 
North America Corp. - however the meeting is now to be on 11 Dec to take 
place after a change in Italian law (so resolutions can be approved by notary 
only and don't need to go to court).

As the dates have changed can you arrange for execution of this power of 
attorney instead - merely the dates have changed.
Sorry for the inconvenience - if you need an initialled copy please let me 
know.

Many thanks
Mike
