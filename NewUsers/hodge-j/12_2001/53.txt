	Here is a transmission tariff with service agreements.  Andy asked for this.

Attached is a FERC proforma tariff.  However, each transmission provider will have its own version approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and it could contain substantial changes.  Also, the ISO tariffs are quite different and have numerous other rules.
