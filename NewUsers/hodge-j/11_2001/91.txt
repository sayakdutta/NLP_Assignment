For your review.

 

Jeff, I have attached a marked copy of the Gas Agreement for your review.
I have tried to identify all of the changes I made to ENA's suggested
language by highlighting them in yellow.  Please note there were a couple
of additional changes which I made to the contract which reflect a new
Credit Policy which was passed by Duke's Policy Committee within the last
week and a half.  These changes can be found in a change to the Gains and
Losses definitions in the Agreement as well as a change in the treatment of
LCs  in 8.3.  Please call me once you have had an opportunity to review
these changes so we can discuss the changes and finalize the Agreement.
Thank you for your help in this matter, Joe
