	Obviously, we would be willing to enter into a Master Agreement with Goldman Sachs/J Aron.  At this point in time we would not be willing to enter into a GISB as we would prefer working under the GTCs until the Master is hammered out.  

	If you can get credit to get us the appropriate information, we can prepare the master.

In negotiating the cross-affiliate master netting agreement with Goldman Sachs/J Aron, they have inquired as to our willingness to enter into a Master Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement for US and Canada gas trading, respectively. Currently, we are trading under GTCs (online and offline). In the interim, they have also asked if we would willing to enter into a GISB to replace working under the GTCs.

I'm not really sure why we haven't gotten a master agreement in place with J Aron in the past other than neither party was focusing on the necessity of doing so. Your recollections/thoughts going forward?
