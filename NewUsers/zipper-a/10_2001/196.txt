I get a smattering of actual, I tool the family down to corpus to the beach two weekends ago, and half the flight was in and out of the clouds. Having a good auto-pilot and stormscope makes a diference, but stormscopes can be tricky to use unless you have a lot of exprience. The trick is never to put them on a setting of less than their maximum range or they never show you anything until it is too late. I have the stormscope feeding through the Garmin 530. Keep flying.
