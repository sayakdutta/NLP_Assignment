I have had you added to distribution list.
 


 


There are 2 sheets in the following attachment that contain Enron transactional data for the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) and Dynegy Direct, labeled as follows:
"Enron Activity - Dynegy Direct"
"Enron Activity - ICE"

  

Note: Total activity for Dynegy Direct is not available, therefore Enron's Percentage can not be calculated.

Let me know if you have any questions or comments.
