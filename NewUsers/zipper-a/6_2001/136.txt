 

Ladies and gentlemen,

A gentle reminder that the pledges you made to Jeff Skilling for the MS150 are now overdue.  Kindly send your check, made payable to "NMSS," to me at EB5008a no later than Friday, June 1.  Community Relations is handling the matching gift for this event, so there is no need to complete a matching gift form.

If you have any questions regarding your pledge, please don't hesitate to call me at x3-5984.  Thank you again for your support on this event.

Regards,
Sherri
