Harry's comments. He has a valid point on the volumetric suspension issue....i think he will launch the product but ask us to put this in the development queue.

In our testing we have found the inability to manage our wing-strikes risk.  The way it works for power markets is that most traders would be unwillling to trade more than 250MW of a wing strike without widening out the bid offer.  Similarly the risk at some point can get high enough to suspend wing strikes. In the current option manager, the only possibility is to increase or decrease the ATM suite vol (which has little effect on the wing strikes anyway).


For that reason we need a volumetric control for each strike. The volumeteric control could be a toggle which could be turned on or off. If the volumetric control toggle si on, corresponding to each strike, there would be  a maximum volume.  If  the strike is hit or lifted by that volume, that strike is automatically suspended and the trader notified. This allows the individual strike risk to be limited.  This also allows us to put some less liquid markets out there - where the price discovery is evolving. In those products we can put the volume to be limited at 100 MW for each strike making the risk more manageable.

Pls give me a call, so that we can discuss this further.
