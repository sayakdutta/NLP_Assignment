	Randy, I think it would be a good idea to do some training in Omaha.  But we should
	coordinate it to cover all customers in the Omaha area.  Then we can do it in one trip.
	Thanks. Lynn

Debbie,
	All the reports will be available online, EXCEPT for the ones I do manually and specifically for UCU, such as the Daily Allocation report.  However, this report is now being emailed to Keith the day of close, thus preventing the lag time in mailing and data entry on your part.  I am also looking into automating more of the information that we send you for commodity invoicing, such as the required screen prints.  Once this information is automated, I will also be able to send those via email or other methods.  
	As we get closer to production for the system, I will speak with Lynn Blair to see if I can set up a training session in Omaha for you, Keith and possibly Joni.  I'll keep you informed.  Thanks.

Randy

Thanks for the notice - will ALL of the  reports we currently get be available on-line?   Including the Daily  Allocation report that you have to specifically run for us  now?    
 
I hope the "training" can be done in Omaha -  I'd like both Keith and myself to attend.

Debbie,   
    I just wanted to let you  know that NNG will soon be implementing a new online invoicing system.  This will allow UCU to pull their own  invoices and backup off the internet immediately as they become available,r  ather than having the day lag for mailing.  Although the system is somewhats  elf-explanatory, I think some training will be beneficial for everyone  involveddue to the amount of information/reports UCU receives.  
    At this point, we are still  in the testing stage of the new system but I just wanted you to be aware that  this is the direction that the invoicing is goingin the upcoming months.  As the system goes into production, I  will once again contact you to set up a convenient time and location for  training.  If you have any  questions, please feel free to give me a call.  Thanks.
