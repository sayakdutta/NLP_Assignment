Is there a reason why the work on September 4th to the VPN can not be done during the normal maintenance window provided for this type of outage?
This outage is presently planned during core business hours and ETS Customer Service has Home Office Workers that gain access through VPN. This will cause them not to be able to provided our customers with any assistance.
