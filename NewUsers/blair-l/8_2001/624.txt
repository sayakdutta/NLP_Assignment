Thanks for getting this change in place.  Reyna is right that we do need this allocation change in place by September 1.

Gerry,

Per your request, this is a reminder to a conversation we had regarding the priority of SBA shippers at a given point during the allocation of that point.  It was discussed  and agreed that SBA shippers trying to pack/peak the system should be given priority over Alternate and Interruptible during an allocation.  

In September, we will resume the Pack & Draft activity and it would be helpful to have this procedure  in place.  Let me know if there is any other information that you need.

Thank you for your help in this matter.
