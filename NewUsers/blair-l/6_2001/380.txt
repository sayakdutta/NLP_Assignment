Please read the note below and let's all make an effort to ensure Omaha can hear us in the 
Morning Meeting.  If you have any questions, let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

After having attended the moring meeting in Omaha the past couple of days, I need to pass along the following observations. I only included on the address list the ones that I could think of off the top of my head who regularly attend the meeting, so please don't think I've limited the list and please pass this on to the others who attend. 

The microphones in Houston are extremely sensitive to any noise. Paper shuffling is the biggest problem. Even "straightening" papers or turning a page has the effect of blocking out the speakers voice. Gas Dailies should be left at your desk. Whispering can also be heard. It tends to make it very difficult to hear in Omaha. It is also imperative that the microphone be put very near the person who speaking, particularly if their voice doesn't carry. I don't quite understand when it can pick up whispers, but can't pick up a softer speaker's voice, but that's the way it is. I think if we are all aware of that, we can greatly enhance the quality of the meeting for the Omaha participants. thanks sj
