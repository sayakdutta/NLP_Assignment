Nancy, I can go either way.  If you guys want to meet and then I can catch up with
Donna that is fine.  I just wanted to be sure we got you the answers you needed.  Thanks. Lynn




Lynn,
I met with Donna this morning to talk about the budget.  I'm preparing a worksheet so that we can get all the changes straight.
If you'd like to meet with us I can let you know when I'll be there.  We don't have a firm time because I don't know how long this report will take.  
Nancy

Nancy, can we meet today at 1:30 to go over my budget?  Please let me know
if that works for you.  Thanks. Lynn



 






Due to the June 1 changes in Shelley's organization, I'll need your
timekeepers to give me your new payroll distribution percentages.  I'm
preparing a new "budget" for Shelley, and would appreciate this
information by the end of this week if possible.

Sheila, I'm sorry I didn't respond to your call last week.  I was on
vacation, and forgot to change my phone greeting.
Call me if you need anything.

Thanks,
Nancy (x36311)
