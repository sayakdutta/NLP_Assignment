Toby, Terry and I talked about this and I will address it again in next weeks
team leader meeting.  Sorry for any inconvenience.  The teams should be
aware of the procedure.  Thanks. Lynn




I no longer post these!! Can you please let the reps know? AGAIN!  I even continue to get calls on this on the weekends also.  I am sending this to you becaue I don't want for one of these to come to me via e-mail and they expect it to go out.  Jean Blair did call me on this and I told her to call John.  I hope you were notified of the extension!!
