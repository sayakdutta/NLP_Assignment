Shelley, just to keep you in the loop since I am out next wee.  This is the information we
sent to Regulatory (Mary Darveaux) as we finalize info on the Strangers Gas Settlement.
Tangie is working closely with Mary and will get her what she needs.  we are also
working with Dan Fancler and Debbie Mosley in Finanace.    If you have
any questions, please let Tangie or Raetta (who is working with Tangie on this) know.  Thanks. Lynn

Mary, as you requested, on yesterday  I have added January 1998 thru May 1998 affidavit volumes.
I have also made adjustments to June and July 1998 volumes.  I didn't multiply the volumes by
the correct number of days for these two months.  If you have any questions or concerns please 
feel free to give me a call.
