Maggie - Rick is not here for ten days.   Can you get someone else to approve it such as Mike Bryant or Lynn Blair?   I really need to get moving on the NNG Measurement Desk and to be successful I have to be able to compare SCADA with EFM for the last Gas Day for NNG.

 

I will need some help on how to get to the SCADA Vs EFM actuals.   I am not familiar with TMS.

Tks - Mike W.
