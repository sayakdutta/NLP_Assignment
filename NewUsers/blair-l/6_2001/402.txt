Shane, Sheila is in Arkansas.  She is doing a lot better.  Her "tingling
in her arm and leg acted up again.  Hopefully she will be home
this weekend.  I'll let you know when we hear something for sure.  Thanks. Lynn







       Lynn:

    I heard that Sheila is in the hospital in Arizona.  I am very concerned about her.  Do you know what is wrong, how can I get in touch with her or Tom?

    Please let me know


     Thanks

      Shane
