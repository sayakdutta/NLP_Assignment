	Harry, I am fine with working off the imbalance because I think it is helping Gary and Steve,
	but I want to be sure it does not go the other way.  Please watch and let me know when
	we net to zero (0).  Thanks. Lynn

Lynn, currently the Bushton Imbalance through October 2001 reflects a volume of 76,862 MMBTUs and a dollar amount of $757,607.21 due Oneok (Oneok long to Northern).  Currently, the month to date volume for December shows Oneok short to Northern by 45,904 MMBTUs.  Continuing with this trend, Oneok will reduce the imbalance amount Northern owes them.
If you have any questions, please call me.

	Harry and Gary, is this shortage helping the existing imbalance?  Thanks. Lynn

 




Thanks,
