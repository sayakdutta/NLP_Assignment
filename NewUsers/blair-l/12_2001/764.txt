Randy Howard has requested that I reach each of you to set up a conference call regarding the Tate Issue.  He wants to know if you would be available this afternoon around 2:00 or tomorrow morning around 9:00.  If you could e-mail me and let me know what will work best for you, I'd appreciate it.  As soon as we hear from everyone, I'll send out another e-mail to give the details.

Thanks,
Shana Farrow
