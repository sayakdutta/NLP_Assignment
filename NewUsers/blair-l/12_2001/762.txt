	at 9:00.  Does that work for you guys?  Thanks. Lynn

	Would all of you be available to meet in my office tomorrow (Thursday) at 9:00 a.m. to
	talk about the morning report for storage that we do each day.  I would appreciate
	your input on the status and how we go forward to simplify the report.

	Thanks. Lynn
