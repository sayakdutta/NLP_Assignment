Everyone -- especially Jerry!  The other day on the conference call it was =
mentioned that many transactions dealing with Enron stock had been canceled=
.  I made a transaction to buy Enron stock on the day it closed at $.61; wh=
en I went into the system on Fri. Hewitt showed that that transaction had b=
een canceled; stock was at $.26; a sigh of relief for me.  I have been off =
line since Friday and upon coming back in I was curious about where my norm=
al contributions went.  Imagine my surprise that my transaction had now tak=
en place--I'm only happy that stock has risen.  It is not my habit to check=
 this site very often--we can't live this way--when we see something posted=
 on the system we need to be able to rely on that information!  Does this m=
ake sense?

Jerry:  I know that you said that the problem was in the manpower not the s=
ystem when you spoke on the conference call the other day.  Instead of stat=
ing that the order had been canceled it would be much better to state that =
there was a delay in posting.  I'm assuming that my transaction took place =
at the closing price on the day I made the transaction--I believe that was =
Wed.-- I made the my change before 3pm -- I have not done the math on that =
but, if they did not cover the transaction until Friday and charged the sam=
e price, what happened to the float?

I know that you are very busy and hopefully I have covered what happened to=
 me so that others can check their balances and protect their savings as th=
ey see fit.  I know that you agree this is something that should be reporte=
d and clarified.

Thanks in advance!
