The South Central team would like to update you regarding our current statu=
s with Ruthe and Jamie's departures:

We understand you will be visiting with us regarding the changes within our=
 team with Ruthe and Jamie's departures.  With Ruthe and Jamie's resignatio=
ns, our team is now comprised of nine schedulers and two accountants.  We a=
re interested in learning if we will be allowed to fill at least one positi=
on.  Ruthe has been such a valued team member and will be sorely missed -- =
not only for her expertise in allocations and scheduling, but in her partic=
ipation in holiday/weekend coverage.  Jamie's participation in the holiday/=
weekend coverage will also be missed.  Of course, their daily presence in h=
andling the telephone calls and participation in team responsibilities are =
also missed.  Since our team rotates the evening position in order to distr=
ibute that responsibility throughout the nine schedulers,  we will miss Rut=
he and Jamie's participation in that as well -- this amounts to approximate=
ly five weeks annually each.  With the reassignment of their evenings along=
 with holiday/weekend coverage, we are basically looking at a rotation of o=
nce every third weekend.

In the interim, we understand Randy has provided a list to you with the sug=
gested reassignments of Ruthe and Jamie's accounts.

We are hopeful we will be allowed to fill this position on our team and we =
look forward to visiting with you.

Thank you,
South Central=20
