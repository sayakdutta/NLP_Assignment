Lynn,   I don't know if John copied you on this.  j.  floyd



Jodie - I have been meaning to give you a call.  I will be in Houston on Wednesday and was wondering if we could get together to visit for awhile.  Since we did a formal interview earlier I don't think we need to go back through the same stuff but, would like to get an update on what you have been doing.

It is going to be hectic tomorrow so I will have Rosemary give you a call to set a time.  

RY - Please set this up one hour for Jodie and I.  The other meetings planned for the day are NGPL and another meeting I need you to set for Mike Stage, Dave Neubauer and myself.  We will need 1.5 to 2 hours with Mike.  

Thanks.  John 

 



						thanks,  j.  floyd
