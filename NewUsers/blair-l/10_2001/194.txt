	to see if we want to wait until Kathy gets home or send to hospital.  Thanks. Lynn

Just wanted to let everyone know that Kathy's mother called a few minutes ago -- Kathy has had her surgery and is now in recovery.  They will let us know when she will be going home.

Any questions, please advise -- thanks.
