	Maggie, Terry and Hasan, I would like to meet with you and Sheila to review both reports
	before we turn anything off. How about 1:00 Tuesday, October 9th in my office or Sheila's
	office?  Thanks. Lynn

Hasan,

The new Service Requestor Report does not have operator information and the Scheduled Quantity Report does have the operator option.  We need to discuss this further before making a decision to turn the old reports off.

All,
some time back we implemented shipper and operator scheduled quantity reports in TMS that were designed to replace the ones that existed at the time.  Since the format of the new reports was slightly different from the old ones, the idea was to wane users off the old ones.  Unfortunately, that has not happened and we are in a situation where we are having to maintain two set of reports that are used for same information.

At this time we would like to take the opportunity to turn off the old reports as part of changes implemented on 10/13.

Thanks
