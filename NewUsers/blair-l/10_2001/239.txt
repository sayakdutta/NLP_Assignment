	Ava, did you get my message about possibly going to LA?  Looks like I am going
	unless cost is ridiculous.  Attached is the hotel I would stay in for Wed. night
	and possibly Thursday night, depending on what you find out with flights.
	Let me know.  Thanks. Lynn

 


 Lynn, here is the link to the Embassy Suites in Downey.  This should provide you with all the information.  

Thanks, Pat
