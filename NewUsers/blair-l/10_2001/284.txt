	Tom, we would be glad to do a timeline review.  I will be out of town until next Wednesday.
	
	John, would you please give Tom a call and work with Ava to set up a time for us to review.
	Tom, did a "brown bag" session work for you guys from 11:30 to 1:00?  If so, we can go
	that route again.
	
	Thanks. Lynn

 

Lynn, since we were unable to get to the review of the nomination process during today's brown bag lunch, there are several of us here in Omaha who would appreciate a follow up session to review the basics of the nomination and confirmation process.  Please let me know if we can get this lined up.  Thanks,
