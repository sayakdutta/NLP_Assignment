	Ava, do you keep track of the Phoneburst list?  Let's discuss in the morning.  Thanks. Lynn

 

If my memory serves me correctly, it was Pattie and now I would like to think it is Ava.

	Terry and John, is there a master list that we all use for the phoneburst we send
	out?  If so, who keeps it updated?  

	Thanks. Lynn
