	Michelle, it was so good to hear from you.  I definitely want to stay in touch.  Next time
	you are in Houston, please let me know and we'll get together.  I am glad you are surviving
	your new earrings.  They are a lot of fun once you adjust to them.  Those dangling pieces can
	be tricky!!.  Take care and look forward to seeing you in the future.  Lynn

 

Hey Theresa and Lynn.  I just wanted to say that I really enjoyed getting
to know you two last week and that I hope we can stay in contact.  I
typically just meet Regulatory people in my circle so it's good to know
people who actually know how their pipeline operates!  Lynn - I think I am
finally getting the hang of operating those earrings.  That Tuesday morning
when we were leaving San Fran. the little dangle got cock-eyed and I
couldn't get the earring out to fix it.  At some point at the airport I
managed to get it out.  Am much better now.  Take care and hope to see both
of you soon.

Michelle
