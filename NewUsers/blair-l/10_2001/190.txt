	Teams, it is very important that you attend these meetings before you work the
	weekend.  This will give us an opportunity to ensure everyone has the same understanding
	of EDI procedures.  

	Mary and Jim, please keep a signed list of who attends training so we can add this to
	our Training list for 2001.  Thanks. Lynn

Every Friday in October and November, Jim Studebaker and I will facilitate an EDI discussion for customer service reps working the weekend.  Please attend this EDI training on Friday, October 5 from 2:30-3:00 in EB3907. The discussion will include a review of the TMS quick response and diagnostic tool screens and the Team EDI web page.  Questions related to EDI and problem resolution will also be discussed. 

Customer service reps working from home will be included via telephone conference call. 

We look forward to seeing you at the meeting.

Jim and Mary
