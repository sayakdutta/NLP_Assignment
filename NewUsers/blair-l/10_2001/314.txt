Lynn,  I think it works best w/Ava & Alma having the responsibility to keep the list updated.  And no, Im not receiving the messages.  Alma deleted my name about a month ago.  I will have her add it to the list again.  Sheila

		Ava ran me a list of the people on the phone broadcast.  Sheila, your name is on the list.
		Are you getting phone messages?  She also cleaned up some old names on the list
		and added the new people.  

		Who do you guys think would be the best person to have responsibility for updates on
		this list?  Should we make it Ava and Alma with them backing each other up?

		Thanks. Lynn
