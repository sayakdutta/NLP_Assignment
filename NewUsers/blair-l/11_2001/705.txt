	Ricki, that sounds great.  Would you please take care of this?  Make it from Gas Logistics?  Thanks. Lynn

 

Lynn, Randy added me to the distrubution.  Do you want to send Roberts mother some flowers?  Sounds like this was a terrible fall.

Thanks, Ricki

 

Robert called in.  The surgery went well and his mother is doing fine.  She will be going home in the morning (Wednesday).  The fall shattered the bones in her right wrist and the doctors put a plate in it.  Robert is going to stay at his mom's until Friday.

Robert's mother's information:

LaBerta Benningfield
500 Rowland
Stephenville, Texas 76401



 

Robert's mother fell and broke one of her wrists this afternoon.  They are doing surgery this evening and he is on his way there.  Robert will call back tomorrow to let us know more about her condition.
