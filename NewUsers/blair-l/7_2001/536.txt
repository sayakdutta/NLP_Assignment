	Sheila, could I have one of the nights next week to give to Laura for Astro tickets?
	I'll give you one of mine!!!!  Thanks. Lynn
	

 

Those tickets were given to Sheila for distribution.  Tuesday July 31st went to Rick and the next game is August 1,,,,,,,, I have not given these out, so let me know if you need them.

Thank you,
Ricki

 

	Ricki, do we have any tickets for next week?  I would like to go ahead
	and give Laura some as a "thank you" for switching pipelines.  Thanks. Lynn

 

Lynn, If you have tickets available for the week of July 22nd and no one has a customer to take out, I would be interested
in having them.  My Mother is in town and I would like to take her.  Thanks, Laura

 

	
	I have 4 astro tickets forTuesday, July 17 (Astro vs Cleveland Indians)  and
	4 tickets for Friday, July 20 (Astro vs Cubs)

	Does anyone have customers they would like to take. 

	Please let me know the date, name of customer and customer company ASAP.

	Thanks. Lynn
