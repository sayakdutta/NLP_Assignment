Provided below are some bullets outlining today's events.  The fact that we can now translate the EDI file is a giant step forward in the testing process.  Jesse and Jeff has done an outstanding job of getting us to this next step today.  

Let Utilicorp know we are committed to our delivery date of Wednesday.
For the Utilicorp file,  the biggest problem was the missing 40 records.  The 40 record contains the volume (quantity).  When the 40 record is missing, the translator stops processing the file so no file is sent to Utilicorp.  By Friday afternoon,  the problem with the 40 record has been resolved for testing.   
The trailer record is incorrectly being sent as a 40 record. Jeff will have David fix it from home and resend this weekend.  
Now that the files are able to be translated.  I will review test files for any data issues and report results.
The HPL file sent to Texaco contains several occurrences of a "?" in the tube inside diameter, tap type, and meter type fields.  When this situation occurs, the meters' with the "?" are sent to an error directory.  The error directory information is sent to the Measurement department to correct.  Once the data is corrected, the meters will be resent.   I am trying to find someone to take ownership for HPL since Enron sold it.  

Regards,

Tammy
