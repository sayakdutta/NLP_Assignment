Gina, each assistant does time sheets.  So I believe Alma Green would be the person that supports you.
Cost centers is Donna's responsibility to work with us.  She has been real good about researching information
for us.  Just let her know what you need.  I may go ahead and have a Primary and Secondary for Time
Sheet questions and we can discuss on Wed.  Thanks Lynn

 

Hi Lynn!

You know how I LOVE dealing with this "stuff!"

Will someone be responsible for timesheets?  And what about cost center reviews?  Does Donna do that?  I need to make sure that appropriate costs are hitting my rc.

Thanks!

Gina

	Well, guys sorry it has taken me so long to get this out.  But attached is
	the list of functions that we could designate certain assistants to be
	primary and secondary knowledge base.

	Please review and let me know of changes and additions you would like to see
	by Tuesday, July 17th.  Then I will recap for the Wednesday meeting.

	Thanks. Lynn
