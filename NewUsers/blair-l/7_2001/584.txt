Dana, the signed copy after the meeting is fine with me.  Thanks. Lynn

 

A letter has been sent to Terra detailing the resolution of the accounts receivable.  Frank Semin is meeting with them again tomorrow, Tuesday, July 31st to review and hopefully get their signature.  I can provide you with a copy if you like or we can wait for the signed version after tomorrow's meeting.

The customer accounts status meeting was held today, July 26th.  Marketing had one follow up item related to Terra and what the status of the receivable and related settlement is.  I am following up with Frank and will get back with Shelly's group. 

You should be receiving copies of the package shortly.

Please let know if you have any questions.

Dana
