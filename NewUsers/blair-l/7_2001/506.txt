It appears that Citizens is continuing to overschedule volumes, thus the oba is still getting bigger.  Even though this oba will probably be cashed out, should we allow them to continue to "overschedule"?
They have also been in a penalty situation the past few months.  When we do cash out, I think that we should deduct these penalties from their payment.
