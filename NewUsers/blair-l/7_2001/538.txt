An Excel  spreadsheet (AR  GT_3Days DMD06.xls) of outstanding demand invoices billed for June 2001 accounting month that have not cleared AR as of July 17th is available in COMMON on gphou-nwgway1. 	

Please update the spreadsheet by 5 p.m. Wednesday (7/18) to identify payments received but not applied and disputed invoices for May 2001 demand. 
 
A worksheet tab is also included in the file showing outstanding demand invoices for January 1999 to May 2001. Be prepared to explain your resolution plan for the non-current demand invoices in the near future.
