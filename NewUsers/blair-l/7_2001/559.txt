Note:  This may open up opportunity at Greensburg as some ANR injection vol=
umes may have to flow from west to east.
ANR said Monday a previously delayed Southeast Mainline maintenance project=
 between Main Line Valves 9 and 11 is now scheduled for today through Thurs=
day. It will add another 75 MMcf/d of capacity constraint to an ongoing red=
uction of 100 MMcf/d that will run through the end of August due to compres=
sor maintenance on the Southeast Mainline.=20

Note:  This is a large one-day outage.  Have we heard anything about how El=
 Paso is mitigating the effects with their customers?
El Paso will shut down the Window Rock Station on July 27 for Department of=
 Transportation tests and station wiring changes. The work will coincide wi=
th modifications to Lines 1205 and 1218 in the San Juan Basin. North Mainli=
ne capacity will be reduced by 380 MMcf/d, and no deliveries can be made fr=
om El Paso to the ITWWINRK interconnect.=20
