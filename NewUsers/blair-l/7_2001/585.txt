Ava, remember I am on vacation August 6 through August 17th.  So it would be good to schedule one
for the week of August 20th,  maybe the 22 or 23 to give me a couple of days to get back.  Thanks. Lynn

 

Lynn, I was getting ready to schedule our July/August Monthly Staff Mtg. is there a certain day you would like mtg. scheduled?

Thanks,
Ava
