Sheila,

Thanks for letting me know about the change in plans.  I am trying to reschedule the accounting training as I am writing this communication.  Tentatively, I a conference room for this Thursday from 10:30-11:30 a.m.  Once I get a confirmation on the conference room.  I will distribute an e-mail notification to all the participants.
