	Tangie, I had a call from Delaine yesterday and she and several others want to come down
	the week of August 20th to clean up all issues.  I said let me know who is coming.  She is
	sending me a list.  Hopefully we can resolve this at that time.  Does that work for you?
	Also, are you here that week of August 20?  Thanks. Lynn

Lynn, I have been trying for several months now to get Onoek to reimburse Northern for a credit they have taken twice (5/00 and 6/00 Commodity billing).

Northern wired Oneok $178,748.87 on 8/10/00 after netting 6/00 commodity items.  On 2/12/01 Oneok came back an took a credit for the same items.  Two items were short paid which now leaves Oneok owing Northern $182,006.19.

Nothern also wired Oneok $26,847.80 on 6/29/00 after netting a transport imbalance with other outstanding items.  Oneok has taken this credit twice as well.

I have tried on numerous occasion to get Oneok to reimburse Northern but, Oneok continues to tell me they are researching the problem and can't seem to locate the wires.  When I spoke with Oneok early on they found the larger wire which was posted as Enron instead of Northern.  Again today they are telling me they can not locate the payment.  The reason for this memo is to get you assist me in getting these items cleared.  I have been working with Richard Tibbs (accounting) and Kelly Olsteen (payment), Richard reports to Randy McIntosh.  I really appreciate your assistance.
