	I talked to Lisa with ENW and told her I would pass her concern on to
	the regulatory and marketing group.  That seem to make her feel better
	anyway.  We are working with her and other customers as needed to
	help them through the Timely process for the first.  At this time we are
	not planning on extended the Timely deadline, but we will revisit that decision
	as we get closer to 11:30.  Thanks for everyones support and help.  Lynn

Lynn,

Trading gas for the first day of month is already a hectic if not absolutely crazy day.  Putting out the final posting of the fuel rates the day of trading is not acceptable.  Northern has one of the most complicated fuel matrices in the industry and expecting your customers to change those matrices the day of trading puts us in a very tough situation.  It will difficult at best to get you our nominations in a timely manner due to your decision.   Next time you decide to change fuel rates at least give us one day to implement the changes not two hours.
