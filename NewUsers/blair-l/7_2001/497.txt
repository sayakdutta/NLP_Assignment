Ava, go ahead and get you a new printer.  Thanks. Lynn

 

Lynn, I wanted to get your approval for a (cheap) printer.  My printer went out and Glenn said it would be cheeper to replace it rather than getting it fixed.  

Everything seems to be going out on me first my monitor now my printer.

Thanks,
Ava
