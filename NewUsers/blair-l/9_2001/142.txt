I would like at host a meeting to discuss new small volume delivery points in the field.  The Business Development group has at least three requests from different entities for new delivery points.  The issues to be discussed at the meeting include type of measurement to be installed at the point, applicability of DDVCs. balancing, OBAs and a host of other issues.  These small volume points take an extraordinary amount of time for many departments and produce a very small amount of revenue for ETS.  Anything that can be done to simplify the process would be a cost benefit to ETS.  

The meeting details are as follows:


	Day			Wednesday
	Date			October 10, 2001
	Time 			3:00 P.M.
	Location		Houston EB 42C2   (relocation of the video conference facilities)
				Omaha 696


I look forward to receiving your input at the meeting.  Please free to forward this meeting notice to anyone you think would like to be involved in this process that I have missed.  Thanks
