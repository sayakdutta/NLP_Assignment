Gary, the attached is a list of the Gas Logistics department that will require access into the common areas of the 39th and 42nd floors 24 hours, 7 days a week.
 
On the bottom left side of this document you will see Josh/Pager listed which you can disreguard because he is listed under Rick Dietz group.
 
Thanks for your help!!!!
