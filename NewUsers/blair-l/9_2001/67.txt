	Ava, I think it is a great idea.  If Shelley is OK with it, would you please coordinate the effort.  Thanks. Lynn

 

When Tangie moved on to her new position she left Chris with $100.00 to have a birthday party for the dept. This is money she had left over from our group.  After discussing with a few other associates it was mentioned this money should be contributed to our fellow Americans that were struck in last Tuesday's attack in D.C. and  N.Y.  I think that's a great idea, maybe we could have a collection jar and add to the $100.00 and then have the company match before sending.  Is this okay with you Lynn & Shelley??

Thanks,
Ava
