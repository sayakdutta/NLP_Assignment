	Brad, just some comments.  At the end do we want to say Customer Services Rep instead of
	Market Service Rep.  and should we put the Hottap help desk phone number in that particular
	Hottap help desk bullitt. Just a thought.  Otherwise looks great.   Thanks. Lynn

Attached is a revision with your suggestions.  I didn't include all the bullitts since they were categorized with others or not yet completed.  

We will answer the additional questions for the FAQ's and elaborate/clarify the pool allocation.
