	Raetta, this is what prompted my questions about finalizing resolution.  Thanks Lynn

 


The following topics were discussed at the meeting:

		1. January 2001 PPA for Reservation Charges for $521,000.  (requires research)

		2.  Duke is reconciling their books on OBA #21047, to be completed by November 2001.

		3. Research July 2001 imbalance on contract 105014 (Pooling).

		4.  We agreed to meet quarterly to identify any disputed items.


Thanks


Robert
