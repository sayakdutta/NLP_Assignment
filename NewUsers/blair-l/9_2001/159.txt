	Sounds good to me.  It leaves us some flexibility.  Thanks. Lynn




I recommend this wording...

ETS is in the process of evaluating the feedback and system requests from the NNG Winter Operations meeting.  A system enhancement to notify shippers when they have nominated to an alternate receipt or delivery point that is not on their contract is on the list for consideration.  The requirements for this modification are currently being determined, however, the exact method and wording of the message has not been finalized.  It is anticipated that the enhancement will be installed in the first quarter of 2002.
