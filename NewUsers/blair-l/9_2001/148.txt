I'm O.K. with this.  Moving forward, are there any other open A/R such as this under $50,000 that we need to be aware of? Is there a report that tracks A/R that are under $50,000 that Marketing can look at?  -Mike

Mike/Diana:
 
I agree with the proposal to write off $14,386.70 based on the fact that the customer made payment and it was not properly accounted for on Northern's records.

FYI




Mike, per our phone conversation, I am sending you a copy of Town of Waukee A/R spreadsheet and an approval to write off the old outstanding A/R issues.
