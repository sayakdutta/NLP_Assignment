Cc: Vasquez, Josue
Importance: High


As our department will be spread out over three different floors, Josh will be used as a "runner" between locations to deliver important mail, faxes and other documents.  

We assigned him a pager so that it will be easier to locate him and request his assistance.  His pager number is 713-200-6435.
