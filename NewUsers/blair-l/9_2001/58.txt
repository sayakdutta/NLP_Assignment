There's got to be a way to pick it up since PNR parks (receipts) are picked up on the Market Summary.  Perhaps make purchases and sales pathed noms into a a purchase/sale point? Thanks for following up.

Rachel, the Market Summary report only picks up delivery quantities; therefore, it will pick up a sale of gas at a point in the supply area as this is a delivery out of linepack.  But, this report will not pick up a purchase in the supply area as a purchase registers as a receipt into the system.  This is why the purchase at Bridgeline Napoleonville (a receipt quantity) does not show up on the report.  We will need to see what we can do about that and get back with everyone.  I will talk with Larry Hill or Donna McGregor and let you know what we can do.  Thx, Jim

Jim, please make sure that you work on correcting the Market Summary and other reports that may be needed for accounting and Gas Control such as a system balance report.  This purchase is still not showing up at least on the Market Summary.  Thanks.

Also attached below is a screen shot from the Scheduled Quantity by Cycle screen of the same purchase quantity for 9/14th.  Please call us if you have any questions.
