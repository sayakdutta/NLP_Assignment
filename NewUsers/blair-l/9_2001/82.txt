I was in the office on Commodity Close, September 13, 2001

	Jean, I believe you were out of the office on commodity close.  Who was reviewing
	the stack of reports on your desk?  Did we properly have the bases covered with
	you out?  Just trying to be sure we have the right coverage for accounting closes.

	Thanks. Lynn
