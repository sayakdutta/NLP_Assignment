    FYI.  Thought you would be interested since most of you have worked with Robert over the
    years with the NBPL interconnects.  Thanks. Lynn



 
Robert Bryan has elected to leave Enron as of the end of September.  Consequently, his last day with us will be today.
 
He has accepted a job offer with Reliant Energy in Houston and will start working for them as of Monday.  Robert will be closely working with two familiar names - Tom Acton and Leon Williams.  We wish him well.
 
Robert shared his intentions with me earlier this month.  However, he had asked that I refrain from announcing his departure until everything was finalized on Reliant's end.  With all that is going on in the world, this process took a bit longer than both Robert and I expected.  And as a result, I was unable to communicate Robert's decision until now.  
 
I will immediately start the process of filling the vacancy created by the loss of Robert.  My current desire is to fill it as an entry-level.
