Kermit has discovered a underground gas leak some where inside the plant yard. They will be digging up yard piping to try and fing the leak. Darrell will call in this afternoon to give us an update as to how long they think they may be down. So until repairs are made Kermit will be unavailable. A posting was put out showing to be down till Oct. 1st. The only point that this affects is Jal Sid Richardson and you will not be able to flow gas from Hobbs to Jal.
