	Steve and Audrey, thank you so much for the invitation, but I will be at the
	NNG Customer meeting in Kansas City otherwise I would plan on attending.
	Have a great time.  Thanks. Lynn

 


Please be informed, because a large number of our invitees had conflicting schedules, we are moving the date of our Appreciation Luncheon.  Steve's main objective was to include as many of  ETS' TW Teams as possible.  To achieve this effort, the luncheon will be moved to a date and time which does not conflict with activities within ETS.  

As soon as we confirm our date, we will notify you via email.

Thanks in advance for your patience and understanding.
