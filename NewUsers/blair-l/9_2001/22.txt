Sheila, good to hear from you.  The meeting went very well. although I was very nervous about this one.
Good response from the customers.  We had approximately 80 customers at the meeting.  I think
that is a record.  Call me when you feel like it and I tell you more.  Hope you are feeling well.  Thanks. Lynn

All,

The presentations have been posted to NNG's "Download" Site at <http://www.nng.enron.com/dob/etfr_downloads.html> at the bottom of the page. These presentations will be hard to email due to the size of the them.  My suggestion would be if a customer wants to save the presentations on their PC, the easiest way to do this is:

1. Right mouse click on the presentation link
2. "Save target as"
3. Pick the directory where you want to save it
4. Click on "save"

This will download the presentation or presentations they wish to save to their PC.

Thx,

Toby
