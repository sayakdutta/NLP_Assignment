In Shelley's staff meeting this morning, she expressed concern about situations (like the one we are currently experiencing) in regard to e-mail and electronic communication channel availability to customers.  Unfortunately, much of the last 24 hour's issues have been driven by poor and incomplete information coming from the corporate team.  In addition, we have suffered our own internal communication challenges.  With that said, she identified two critical areas that she wants to resolve in the short term;  

1.)  An efficient e-mail distribution capability that is not dependent on Enron firewall access.  Although messages were successfully sent to customers yesterday, the process was cumbersome and time consuming.  A process that can handle the complete distribution list and/or segmentation of messages (ie by pipeline) is needed.  The service should be available from remote locations.  I am currently investigating this issue.  (i.e. bulk mail handler and reliability via outside ISP source.) 

2.)  A communication diagnostic tool that is not dependent on corporate team information.  There should be the ability to test our communication abilities/processes to external parties.  The tool should address what customers can access, whether they can receive messages, etc.  Again it should have remote capabilities. 

I would characterize the goals of addressing these issues to be that ETS knows what its current electronic communication situation is and that it is accurately communicating it to customers.  

Alma will set up a meeting to discuss ASAP.  Alma, please invite those on the "To" distribution.
