	Coffee on Thursday sounds great.  Just give me a call.  Have a great day with your Mom.  Thanks. Lynn

 

Hey Lynn!  Lunch sounds great.  However, I'm off tomorrow - I'm going on a little retreat with my mom.  And then on Thursday, I'm having lunch with my new boss!  Maybe we could grab a coffee on Thursday afternoon.  I'll call you.  I hope you're not feeling the pain!

	Gina, let's do lunch and I'll answer all your questions.  Are you available Wed. or Thursday?  Thanks. Lynn

 

How's it going down there?  Did ya'll get moved?  What's the mood since the re-org has been announced?  Is this a good thing?

Inquiring minds want to know.....
