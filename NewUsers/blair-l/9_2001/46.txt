	Shelley, FYI. I thought I would pass this on to you.  This was the gentlemen from Italy that 
	we spent time with a couple of weeks ago.  Thanks. Lynn

 

Dear Lynn,
let me express my deep sorrow for the tragedy that occurred to your Country.
With the wish that those who are responsible for the cowardly attacks be soon discovered and punished. At stake is Liberty, for all of us.
God Bless America
