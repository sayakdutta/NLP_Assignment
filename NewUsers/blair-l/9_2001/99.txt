	Don, this is great.  This report was a big hurdle for us.  I will check with the team on how it
	is working.  Thanks for all your support as we go forward in our Business Objects training.
	Thanks. Lynn

I finished development of a BusinessObjects Report to produce the NNG Bushton PVR information.  Today I turned this over to the Gas Logistics South End Team.  The report is available via the intranet web server Infosource.ets.enron.com.  I walked the team through the login process, refreshed and printed the report.  I plan to demonstrate how this report was built to the Gas Logistics report team being coordinated by Mike Bodnar.  I will do so at one of our earliest meetings.  Please let me know if you have questions.
