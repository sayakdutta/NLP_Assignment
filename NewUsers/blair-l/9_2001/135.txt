    Ava has willingly taken on this task.  So she will be the point person
    going forward.  Thanks. Lynn

I believe it should be Ava, Sharon or Ricki since they will be located on 42.  Pilar and Linda are the marketing assistants on 42.
 
Any other thoughts?
 
 



Rick,
Since Maria Perales was the point person to schedule 42C2 and has since moved to 3AllenCenter, who will be the new contact person to schedule 42C2?  This information is posted in the intranet (see link below).  Market Services and Marketing assistants have access to it.
