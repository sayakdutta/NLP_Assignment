Lynn,
Christine is putting an agenda together for the BP Amoco meeting. The question came up, can we disclose to BP that we are in the process of changing when we allocate? Please let me know. My thoughts are, yes. Thank you. Terry Kowalke

 

We will have a preliminary meeting Tuesday 9/18 to discuss the agenda for the lunch meeting with BP.  We will meet in 4194 from 3-3:30.

The lunch meeting with BP will be Wed 9/19 from 12-2 in 4102.  We are waiting to hear from BP regarding topics of discussion and attendees.

See y'all then!
Amy
