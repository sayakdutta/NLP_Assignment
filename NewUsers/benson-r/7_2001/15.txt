	Hey Holly just thought I'd say hi. It has been a while, the last time we talked you were on your way to Mexico with your new man. How was it ? Do you now have a ring on your finger ? Any ways I suck at writing letters so email me back if you want. We should go golfing some time or go for a drink. 		

					Talk to ya later,  Rob
