Hope you are doing well. What about getting together for drinks after work sometime next week. 

Also, would you be interested in buying my Houstonian membership. The entry fee for new members is $9000, I am ready to sell mine for $6500. Its pretty lavish locker-rooms and facilities. 

Email me or call me 713-802-0560 ( cell 832-723-6363) when you get a chance.

Harry

Hey man,

Drinks sound good, Wed or Thurs would be good for me. I am interested in your Houstonian membership, but are you sure you can sell it to me.
