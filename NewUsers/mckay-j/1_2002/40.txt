I am interested in moving to the Enron Center or if nothing is available to Allen Center.  I work in Enron Center South and my company number is 0413 and my cost center is RC 107313.  

Regards,

Good Evening,

	The purpose of this e-mail is to inform you that a mandatory move from your current parking location is required due to the expiration of Enron's parking contract with the Metropolitan Garage as of 1/31/01.

	The Parking & Transportation Dept. is offering alternative parking in the Allen Center Garage for $94 per month. In order for us to make this a smooth transition for you, we are asking that you respond as soon as possible, however, all parking changes must be made via e-mail, no later than 1/18/01. The Allen Center spaces will be on a first come - first serve basis. If you have any questions you can contact Parking & Transportation at x3-7060.
