Scott,

Here is the unwind structure for 7500/MMBtu of the Boston Gas deal.  Could you please set aside some time tomorrow to discuss the costs and residual risks that would be left after unwinding this deal.  I would like to include Gerry and Howard from our Calgary office in this discussion so they can brief you on the current status of Cal pine.  Below is a couple of slides that show the unwind.

Regards,

Jon
