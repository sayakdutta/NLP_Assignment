Today around 3:30?

 

Jon,

I have changed the format around to landscape and currently have everything in the report on one page.  Perhaps we should sit down and talk about which interconnects are the most important to add, because there are quite a few.  Right now, I see interconnects with TGT, Tenn, CNG, Transco, CGT, and NFG.  With so many important points, I am not sure which ones to add and which are negligible.
