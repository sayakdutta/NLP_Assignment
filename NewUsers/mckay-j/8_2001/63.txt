Helllllooooo Aunt,

I'm on my way to Houston tomorrow.  I've sold the China cabinets, but not the TV cabinet. (Still working on it!)  Some people have finally shown a bid for my house but its a little less than I really wanted to sell it for, so I'm stalling.  I've pretty much sold everything else I own except for the knick-knacks.  I have to come back in a couple of weeks and take care of actually moving everything and collecting the money.   I'll be sure to keep you informed when I know more.


Love

Jon

 


Hi Jon,
Just a quick note to see how you are making out selling your house.  I hope things are going well.  Got a note from your mom and sounds like your dad's party went well.  Drop me a line when you have time.
Love   Donna
