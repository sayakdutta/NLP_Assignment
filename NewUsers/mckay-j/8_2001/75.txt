Here is how Gator's treat there young.  Also, you are  correct, the API polls have Florida ranked one, Miami ranked two, and Florida State ranked 6.  Florida did not have the most vote for the number one place (Miami had more) but non the less are coming out of the gate in the number one spot.  Do you think the sports writers spent all their time in Florida, or what?  Crazy!
