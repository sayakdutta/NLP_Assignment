Hey,

Houston is Hot hot hot..........So far the living arrangements are good, however, I remain cautious about the potential going forward.  The loft is very cool (i.e. trendy, not cool temperature), but I can hear the sucking sound on my bank account.  Its only been a couple of days, but so far so good.  My email address is the same and you can get a hold of me by sending me a note.

I think I may have sold my house, there is still a few thing to be worked out, but I'll let you know when I'm comin' back to Calgary so you can pick-up some of the kitchen stuff.

Regards,

Jon  

 

Jonny how's it going?  Just wondering how the living arrangements are so
far?  I'm sure it's all still very blissful being as it's only been 3 days.
Hopefully you guys are doing okay!

Wasn't sure if your email address changed or not....get back to me when you
have a minute, let me know what's happening!

Glen
