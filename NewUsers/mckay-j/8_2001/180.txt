Hi Rod,

I'm sorry I have not been reachable but I was waiting until I had all the info you needed before I contacted you.  The new info is as follows:

#1808, 909 Texas Ave.
Houston, Texas, 77002



(h) 713 225-1230
(w) 713 853-4810
(f) 713 646-8453


Do you know what happens next?  Do I need a lawyer?  Do any other provisions remain?  Any idea how I get paid? Any help would be appreciated!

Best Regards,

Jon


As for golf course, I was thinking I'd meet you at Pebble Beach..........Just kidding.



 

Hello John,

Your home looks great with a sold sign on it. Yes it is sold. The only thing
I need now is your new address, phone # and any new e-mail addresses you
might have.

Good luck John I owe you a round of golf at a course of your choosing, say
hi to the gang and I will be in touch.

Have a great day,

Rod Forsythe
