There has been a line rupture at the South Wapiti plant which has resulted
in about 200 mmcf off the NOVA system.  Des doesn't have any details as yet
other than we will likely lose about 5000 gj of production today.  Her info
so far says that no one was hurt but the fire trucks are there.  We'll keep
you posted.
