Good morning Jon,
 
I need some firm pricing for the Telus Convention Centre, Lindsay Park and for Hillsboro Enterprises.  one -Two - three year contracts.  Hillsboro and Telus out of Oct. 1  and Lindsay out of Aug 1  - one year contract.  Telus should close today( if all goes well )  If you don't get back to me before 8:15AM could you email the prices to Mark Dickin.  I'm off to Edmonton for a game leaving at 9:00AM.  Thanks Jon.
