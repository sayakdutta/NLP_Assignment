Ryan could you make contact with Jesus and be his contact for pricing. 

Could you set up a process (maybe the bidfax) where by he can get daily pricing info.

Thanks,

Jon

John,
Would it be possible for you to assign one person that is easily accessible to provide Jesus with indicative pricing for Empress throughout the month?  Possibly Ryan Watt? Maybe you could include Jesus on an email distribution list (if there is such a thing) to provide him with indicatives.  We have one customer in particular that likes kicking tires, and Jesus doesn't like bothering you guys all the time for him.
