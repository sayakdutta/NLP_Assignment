I don't think this is going to be the answer to all your problems.  It's the results of the audit.  I'm not sure they were all that successful?

 


The Canada Trading Audit, executed by Andersen, has been completed.  The attached Final Report has been reviewed with key process owners and issues were discussed with appropriate personnel, both during the audit and at the Closing Meeting.  Final Reports will also be reviewed in detail with Wes and Sally on a periodic basis.


If you have any questions, please contact me at ext. 5-4554.  Thank you.
