Scott,

I still can not seem to pull up TDS.  I can get in to the Position Manager, but I am unable to see any of the trading books (most important FT-East-new).  When you have a few minutes could you please let me know who understands/runs the system, so I can get my problem sorted out.

Thank you,

Jon
