I'm back in town from the 19th-23rd...(assuming I can fly back)...and hopefully we can hook-up then.  If you need some kitchen-ware (i.e.. utensils) let me know and I'm sure we can work out a deal (There is no room for my stuff in this apartment).

Hope you are doing well and say hi to everyone for me.

Jon

 

Hey Jonny, what's up?  Jeez, just heard about the bombings, how is that
affecting you guys?  Let me know what's going on....

Scotty told me about your house being sold....that's great.  I think I'm
going over with him tonight to start clearing out some stuff...I'll grab
the plants and the light like we discussed....Scott may store the poker
table for me.  Let me know if there's anything else you need us to do...

Hope everything's okay down there...
