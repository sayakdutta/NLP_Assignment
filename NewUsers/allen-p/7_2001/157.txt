On Friday, July 13th, a shipper group filed a complaint against El Paso Nat=
ural Gas alleging that the pipeline has oversold capacity into California d=
ue in part to unlimited growth of demands by full requirements customers.  =
The complainants request:

(1) that all full requirements customers be converted to contract demand cu=
stomers at reasonable levels;

(2) a mandatory expansion of the pipeline system to be used to meet El Paso=
's existing firm transportation obligations; and

(3) that FERC prohibit El Paso from collecting demand charges for firm serv=
ice it is unable to provide until such time as El Paso can show that it is =
capable of meeting its firm service obligations.

A Technical Conference in El Paso's Order No. 637 proceeding (RP00-336) is =
scheduled for Wed., July 18, 2001 to discuss El Paso's systemwide capacity =
allocation issues, which will include topics addressed in the complaint.=20
