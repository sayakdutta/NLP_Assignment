Don,

Jeff Gosset runs the risk management group.  I spoke to him about including a module on how the books work.  He liked the concept and is willing to sit down with you to discuss further.  His number is X37306.  He is expecting a call to set up a meeting.

Phillip

 



Tim,

Please clarify what is not right so I may make changes.  I have received
verbal approval from Phillip today in our meeting.

This looks about right.

We have begun working on our first deliverables for the Risk Management
Simulation project. The first thing we need your sign-off on is the
Target

audience in order to help us maintain focus as we design the simulation.

I would appreciate it if you could review the attached document and
respond
by end of day Monday, the 10th, with either your revisions or your

Thank you.
