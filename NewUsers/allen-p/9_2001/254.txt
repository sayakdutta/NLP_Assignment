Agreed. The generator motion is very complete so it would seem to me that our pleading in support can be very short.

We should definitely support it.  We have the very same issues with the ISO.

Dan, I am interested.  I know that Sue Mara spoke with Ron on this subject also, although I was not on the call.  The matter was not discussed on our Western Wholesale call this morning either, since I did not become aware of it till later.  I would therefore like to receive input from Sue and others on our team about this, getting final sign off to proceed from Linda Robertson and Jim Steffes.  If we elect to proceed, it would be appropriate to bill all participating marketers in equal shares.  Thanks.  Ray

Cheryl Ryan has raised the suggestion of a joint answer by the Marketer Group in support of the Generators' recent motion on credit issues.  If so, this would need to be done asap.  Please let me know if you are interested in joining in such a pleading.
Thanks.  Ron
