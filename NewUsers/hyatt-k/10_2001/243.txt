but did he pass the drug test?  Good for him.  I hope he makes it thru boot camp.
Have fun on your trip.  I was going to ask you for a ride home tomorrow but you won't be here.  I'm selling the Maxima to Cathy Corbin for her son.  Now if I can get the stock price up, I may actually be able to afford a truck.  Have you seen the new Dodge-- way cool!!




Who would have thought? My brother, Todd (Odd with a T), very smart but got off the path and never made it back on, just swore into the Navy. He will be training in San Antonio (Military Police). He signed on for 5 years.......the longest commitment to anything in his life! He scored extremely well on all their tests. I am proud of him!
