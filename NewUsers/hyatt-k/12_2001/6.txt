Where are you at and I'll bring you a packet with an explanation?

 

I'll take one, just let me know what I need to do.

 

at this point I have several on my desk now and others that will be coming to me shortly.  Cost is about $55 - $75 per child, depending on how good a shopper you are.  Let me know how many kids you'd like.

thanks

Kevin,

Are you still looking for sponsors for the Enron Kids program?  Sean Bolks said you had 14 kids that needed sponsors last Friday.

Let me know,

Thanks,

Preston
