Kevin,   we have another camping trip planned for Garner Sate park and
wanted to invite you and the family.
The kids have a vacation the last week in April   They are off Friday the
26th and Monday the 29th.  We have several
campsites reserved.
We are going, actually, just me and the kids as Pam has another commitment,
the Julian's , Julie Vance and Regan,
Marti and her kids, and someone else I can't remember.  Anyway, if you guys
are interested, you're sure invited.
Hope everything else is going well for you.
Talk to you soon.
