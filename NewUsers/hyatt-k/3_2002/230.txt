our fax number is really 646-3225.  Apparently facilities gave us the wrong number.  I tested this new number and it works.

We now have a fax machine located in front of EB4079.  The fax number is 713/646-2700.  There are fax cover sheets in a tray on the table for your convenience.

ETSMarketingA  (the network printer from 13) hitched a ride with us and is available for you to print to.  Same location as fax machine.
