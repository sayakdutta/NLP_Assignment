Dear Phil,
	Hope you received the easement and line maps OK.  We are pulling the maintenance records together and should have this done by 3/15.  How does your calendar look for Friday 3/22 to meet at the Monahans office or early the week of 3/25.  Prior to 3/22 I will be out of the office at a power convention in St. Louis, returning Thursday 3/21.  I could then meet you at Monahans on 3/22 or sometime the following week.

let me know.
Best Regards,
Kevin Hyatt
