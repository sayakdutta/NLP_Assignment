Hi Don--
	I picked up one of your flyers.  I'm looking for storage for my 2000 Expedition to hold hunting equipment.  What configurations do you have?  Also, would you be willing to sell the plans (copyrighted of course).  I have a pretty extensive wood shop and might want to make the box myself.  

thanks
