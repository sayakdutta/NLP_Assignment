Kevin,

It was good to talk with you this morning.  As mentioned to you yesterday, =
following is some information on a project that I've been working on.  I'd =
appreciate your assitance in getting the word out regarding this project.  =
=20

As you are aware, there are many families that have been affected by the re=
cent layoffs at Enron.  I along with two other ex-employees (Karen Cutler a=
nd Sue Nix) have been working on a project which will provide assistance to=
 ex-employees of Enron. We wanted to do something to help our fellow employ=
ees and also provide a tool that others could use to provide assistance to =
ex-Enron employees.   Just think, if 100 people donated $50 each that would=
 be $5000 that we could give to ex-employees for assistance as needed for b=
asic necessities (such as money for food, to pay their rent/mortgage, or ut=
ilites).  I know the ex-employees would really appreciate this assistance. =


ow we'll be distributing the funds. This week, we've been working with an a=
ttorney and a local bank. An account has been set up where people can make =
contributions. All the money will be given back to ex-Enron employees that =
need assistance with basic necessities, such as money for food, rent/mortga=
ge payments, and utilities. We've contacted the local media with the inform=
ation so that the community can be made aware of what we're doing. Our abil=
ity to provide assistance will be based on the response we receive.  As you=
 can see, we're using our values from Enron to help others, and would appre=
ciate your assistance with communicating this information to the current En=
ron employees. =20

Please send this information in a general announcement to the current Enron=
 employees so they can be aware of a way to help their fellow ex-employees.=
  If you need to speak with me or have any questions, I can be reached at 2=
