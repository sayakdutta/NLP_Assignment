We plan to hold a conference call in January or February 2002 with the Chair and the other presenters participating.  You will be notified with the date and time for the conference call.  For now, plan to present for about 15 -20 minutes on the subject.  Time should be allotted at the end for a question & answer session.  
By November 15, please submit a one to two paragraph abstract on the subject.
