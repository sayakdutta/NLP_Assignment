We will likely not have a problem until after the merger closes next year.  I think for this year we'll be fine.  

 

All,
If you read the question/answer area regarding the merger it appears that the matching fund program may not survive.  Therefore, we may need to do more shopping with our Enron Kid account funds than we originally planned.  Do we need to meet to discuss a contingency plan?
Thanks, LV
