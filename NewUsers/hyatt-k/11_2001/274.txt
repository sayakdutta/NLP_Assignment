A group of girlfriends went on vacation and they see a five-story hotel 
>>with a sign that reads "For Women Only".  Since they were without their 
>>boyfriends, they decide to go in. 
>> 
>>The Doorman, a very attractive guy, explains to them how it works, "We 
>>have 5 floors. Go up floor by floor, and once you find what you are 
>>looking for, you can stay there.   It's easy to decide, since each floor 
>>has signs telling you what's inside. The only rule is, once you leave a 
>>floor, you can't return to it." 
>> 
>>The women talk it over and decide to go for it. They start going up, and 
>>on the first floor the sign reads "All the men here are horrible lovers, 
>>but they are sensitive and kind". The friends  laugh and without 
>>hesitation move on to the next floor. 
>> 
>>The sign on th! e Second floor reads "All the men here are wonderful 
>>lovers, but they generally treat women badly". 
>>This wasn't going to do so again they head for the stairs. 
>> 
>>The friends move up to the Third floor where the sign read "All the men 
>>here are great lovers and sensitive to the needs of women." This was good 
>>but there were still two more floors... 
>> 
>>So on to the Fourth floor, the sign was perfect.  "All the men here have 
>>perfect builds; are sensitive and attentive to women; are perfect lovers; 
>>they are also single, rich and straight" 
>>The women seemed pleased but they decide that they would rather see what 
>>the fifth floor has to offer before they settle for the fourth. 
>> 
>>When they reach the Fifth floor, there is only a sign that reads: 
>>"There are no men here. This floor was built only  to prove ! that there is 
>>simply no way to please a woman."
