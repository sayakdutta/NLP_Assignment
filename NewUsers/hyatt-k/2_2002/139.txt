Jean,
	I'm trying to rebuild my PC at home.  The hard drive cratered on me.  I've installed a new one, but the only windows operating system I have is on a restore disk from Compaq (win95) and for some reason, it's giving me an "image builder" error when I try the restore.  This may be due to the fact that I trying to restore on a bigger hard drive than the original.

Anyway, I also have win98 upgrade 2nd edition.  When I try to load this, is looks for verification of ownership of a previous win system (which I don't have except on the restore disk which won't work).

So my question is this, do we have an old Win98 operating system lying around I can borrow so I can load my win98 upgrade?

thanks,
Kevin
