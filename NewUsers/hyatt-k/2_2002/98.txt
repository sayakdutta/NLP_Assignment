it likely won't survive as Enron (due to the stigma), they'll rename it something that better fits a pipeline business restructured as some kind of master limited partnership.  Things are OK, some days are worse than others.  I'm still trying to develop new gas pipeline business in the west, but it's hard without a lot of loose cash lying around.




KevIn: 
What are you doing these days? I have been reading all the newspapers and watching CSpan, etc, keeping on the Story.  Are you ok with your position? 
Drop me an email when you can. Hope things turn around and Enron survives if it makes sense.
