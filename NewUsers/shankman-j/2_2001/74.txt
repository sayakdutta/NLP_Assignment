I'd like to leave out mention of our equity participation in the first and 
third paragraphs, and reword the second paragraph to state that envera's 
customers will have access to enron's products.  (leave out the qualifier 
"many"  which I read as "partial")

Attached for your review and approval is the press release that Envera wishes 
to issue immediately announcing the participation of Enron Global Markets as 
an equity partner and trading member.  We already have sent it to John Nowlan 
and John Viverito and secured their approval.  Please let me know your 
comments. 

Thank you.
