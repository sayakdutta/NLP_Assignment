Hi Thor, 

Sorry you won't make our offsite, but a little vacation every so often is 
never a bad thing.  
I do have a question about Bjarne's promotion to director.  When I look at 
the P&L for Oslo weather trading, you showed a loss of about $1 million, and 
I don't think that deserves this promotion.  What else does he do?  I'm also 
concerned that neither Mark (nor I) had any notice of this.  His promotion 
has caused some difficulty over here and I'd like to get this cleared up.  

Jeff
