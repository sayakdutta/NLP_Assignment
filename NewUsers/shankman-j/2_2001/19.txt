Clay, please add the rest of the crude team to crude specific alerts.  
Thanks.  Also, can we set up an instant messenger system for these guys?

Word from Israel is that the alert has been downgraded for the time being.  
Sources report that US aircraft flying over western Iraq saw that the troop 
movements and missile preparations have been halted, at least for the time 
being.
