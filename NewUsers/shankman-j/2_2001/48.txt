get me a spot on the shuttle.  But I'll probably use a car service.  What 
time does this concert thing start, and can you get me all other directions, 
and info.  Thanks.  Jeff

I am pleased you and your spouse are able to join me at the Rodeo on Monday 
19th February.  Your tickets will be delivered to your office tomorrow 
(Thursday).

The Enron Suite is number 23.  It will be open from 5.30pm.  As there is no 
parking at the Astrodome, I have arranged for a shuttle bus to run from the 
Enron Building to the Astrodome from 6pm until 10.30pm.  If you would like to 
utilize this, please respond to Nicki Daw (x33497).
