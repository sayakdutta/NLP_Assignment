Enron Shipping Services Weekly report 07/2001




Highlight

The cape market is still rising, but very gently.  Owners are still quite 
concerned about the year as a whole and are actively seeking coverage.  We 
spend much of last week covering all our short positions thru to May.  Plan 
is to sit back for a couple weeks and then sell short again for Q2, Q3 and Q4 
if feasible.  

We struck a deal last Friday with Cetragpa ( Pierre's ex co. ) by which we 
agreed a collar on the RBCT/Rotterdam route for 2002/2003.  We bought a call 
at $7.80 and sold a put at $6.80 for 600,000 MT ( this could be valuable 
hedge for the first 2 years of the Gijon Business).

On the panamax front, Pacific market is still relatively active and strong 
while the Atlantic is soft with few grain cargoes from the US Gulf.  We fixed 
last week a contract to supply 3 panamax vessels of coal and Petcoke to 
Aceralia ( Spanish Steel Mill ).

We are also currently seeking freight for our first freight and coal business 
into the US east coast ( Thanks to the US coal guys ) on a Belted self 
discharge handy max to load in second half of this year.
