The Asian Pulp & Paper debt situation is once again becoming critical to 
Asian growth prospects.  AP & P is the most popular Asian bond holding among 
foreign investors.  AP & P narrowly met a Feb.1 deadline for a debt payment 
and has a 30 day grace period on another which runs out at the end of 
February.  Depressed pulp and paper prices and a high risk premium for 
Indonesian debt raise serious doubts about AP & P's ability to meet this 
payment.

The ripple effect of an AP &P default or government-imposed restructuring 
would be significant for Asian credit and equity markets, with possible 
contagion effects for other emerging markets.  We will continue to update 
this issue in the days ahead.
