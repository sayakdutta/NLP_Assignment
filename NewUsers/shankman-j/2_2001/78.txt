Can you try to use your amazing persuasion skills on Mauricio - he has an 
Associate offer and came to sell weekend.  He's trying to decide between us 
and ABN Amro (also had a JP Morgan offer, but decided not to take it).  His 
concern is the $10k differential on our signing bonus and $20k differential 
in the guaranteed year end bonus because he wants to pay down his loans.  He 
wants to see if there is anything that we can do.  He feels like Enron is the 
better long term choice, but banking is a better short term choice.

Can you give him a call - 215.732.9989 (home) or 215.432.0183 (cell).
