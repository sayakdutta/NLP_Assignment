I'd like access for me.  I think the crude and products guys are looking at 
it, so I don't understand that we haven't signed a participant agreement.  
Thanks.

In order to manage the enrollment of users onto this system, all users must 
enroll via eRequest.  The approval process will mimic that of EnronOnline.  
The requester will go to our internal security application (eRequest) and 
search on ICE.  They must select the products they want to trade - ICE offers 
gas, power, oil and metals.  This will then generate a message to the 
applicable desk head for approval, and generate the appropriate message to 
security to install the application needed to run the ICE.  Once this is 
approved, Stephanie Sever (x33465) will coordinate getting user ids from the 
ICE.  This normally takes a couple of days.  As soon as we get user ids and 
passwords, we will notify the applicable individual.  

To date, the entities that have signed Participant Agreements are ENA, EPMI 
and ECC.  The cost is $500 per month per user on the ICE.

Please call me if you have any questions.
