When she was hired, there was no 3rd year analyst program.  She is going to 
be placed in the trading non-rotational program, as well.  In addition, she 
has made well over 1million dollars trading a book on the gas floor, and has 
been made our resid trader.

Jeff,

According to our criteria, Sara is not eligible to be promoted to an 
Associate at this time.  Sara would only have 20 months in the program as of 
3/31/01and does not have the 2 years of relevant commercial experience prior 
to Enron necessary to promote her to the Associate level.  However, Sara 
could be promoted to a 3rd Year Analyst at the mid-year PRC.  

Thank you,

Lisa Jones
