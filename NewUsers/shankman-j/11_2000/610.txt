The Weather Risk Management Group will transfer Catherine Woolgar from the 
Oslo office to the Houston office as soon as she is able to transition out of 
her responsibilities in Olso.  In Houston, Catherine will assist in trading 
the US portfolio and be responsible for a number of EOL cities.  Catherine 
has developed a very good understanding of trading weather risk management 
products and the peculiarities of the weather market.

Ross McIntyre in the London Office will continue to provide general support 
to the Oslo office while developing relationships with the commodity desks in 
London and with the market generally.  Additionally, Ross will continue to 
assist in the development of the trade and portfolio analytical systems to be 
utilized globally by the weather desks.

In oder to significantly grow the weather risk management business, we are 
committed to the vision of trading and orginating locally while managing 
globally.  Tthe Weather Risk Management Group ultimately expects to have 
weather trading in most Enron's offices that trade other commodities.  
Accordingly, as soon as commercially feasible, Catherine will return to 
London to work with Ross McIntyre to establish a trading presence in the 
London office.
