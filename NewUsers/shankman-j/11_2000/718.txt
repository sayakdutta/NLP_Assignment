Hi everyone!

Has Scott Yeager in EBS been asked to participate in this yet?  I know from 
voice mail exchanges that he was being mentioned.  I think he would be an 
excellent choice and do a great job. 

 Clearly, Louise would be great, but she has been bombarded with these 
requests and is having to decline most.

Thanks!

Another person who might be a good speaker is Louise Kitchen, who started 
Enron Online and is now COO or Enron Net Works.  A third is Tom Gros, also in 
Enron Net Works, who started our bandwidth trading business and is now 
developing some additional eCommerce capabilities for Enron Online.  How 
senior should the speaker be?

Can you send Laura and I information on the Entrepreneurship Conference - 
location, time, if there is a career fair, what we get with our level of 
sponsorship, etc.  Laura has tentatively agreed to go up with whoever ends up 
speaking on the panel.   She also suggested Rex Shelby as a speaker - he is 
an MD in Net Works and was formerly part of EBS.  He has started at least two 
companies, including one that was purchased by Enron and has become an 
integral part of the network we are building out.  Let Laura know if you'd 
like her to approach him about speaking.
