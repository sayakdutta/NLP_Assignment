Everything was ok, just busy.  Good book?  I just started "When the sons of 
heaven meet the daughters of earth"  have you heard of it?  I'd absolutely 
love to go the the Anne Frank thing, but I can't get back from the management 
conference.  I'm on a panel (with Jeremy) early Friday a.m.

they must make you sign a confidentiality agreement when you walk in the 
door!  well, I guess I have no choice but to believe you, even though some 
juicy details would be kind of fun!  
Her piano was so bad they had to do it twice.  At least I got to finish a 
book.  



piano tuning?  nothing bad about last night--very tame.

ok...so I do want the low-down on last night b/c I am sure there is a lot 
that is inappropriate for email!  I will be out of the office all afternoon 
so if you want to talk I'll be on my cell phone 256-5582.
Big....small....it is still the Enron Executive Committee and you should feel 
extremely proud.  I am so happy for you!
I hope that you have a great lunch and that your speech went will this 
morning.

Great!  Sorry YOU weren't there...
I'm on my way out  for a lunch.  I'll call you later.   (I'm excited about 
the exec committee, but it is a little big, so I told Skilling we should 
rename it the exec villiage!)
