If the interviews are 2 on one, then I'm ok with only one interviewer.  Remind me to look around on monday.

Hello Jeff,

Kevin McGowan has cancelled as second day interviewer at Wharton.  I was wondering if you had anyone that could spare us time or anyone in mind I could contact?

Thanks for the help.
