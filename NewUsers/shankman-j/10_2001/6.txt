is this in the rolodex

 

Sunday is better than Saturday for me. (The Poe Elementary School Carnival
is scheduled for Saturday, and then Jack and Jean are attending his
teacher's wedding that evening).

Give me a call, or I'll try you on Saturday to finalize.

   Jeff -

   If you'd like to get together to have a drink and talk about something
   other
   than work, give me a call.

   Jean's got a meeting at school tonight, but other than that we should be
   around all weekend.

   Home: 713.522.9381
   Work: 713.653.8207.
