I don't really know him.  I'm not sure he is the king, but I'll ask around.

Jeff,
 
Fred has been heading up EBS' Asian trading business out of Singapore.  Prior to this he traded power for Fallon.  May not be as high powered as Storey, but worth taking a look.  I'd like to get him set up to speak with you by VC.  When would you be available?

PS we are now 15 hours ahead of Houston.  Japan does not turn its clocks back in the fall.  Would be much easier to have calls during our morning versus your morning.
 



Joe,
 
I enjoyed our conversation yesterday and look forward to learning more.  Now it seems more challenging than ever to pick a spot within Enron, but I have had good conversations with several groups and it does look like some good opportunities do still exist around the organization including your shop.  As you look over my CV you will I'm sure notice that my educational background is different than the typical Enron recruit.  I think that my performance during my years within Enron and the consistent recognition I have received in PRC in some of the core operations of Enron's business should demonstrate that at this point differences in education are insignificant relative to my potential to positively contribute to the business.  I look forward to talking again soon.

Regards,
Fred
