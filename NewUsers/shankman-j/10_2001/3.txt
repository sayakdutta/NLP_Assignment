Hi Betsy,

Sorry for the delay.  What are you interested in doing?

Jeff, 

Just got off the phone with Greg Curran.  Guess he's been talking to you about the fact that I'm moving off the bandwidth trading desk here in London and have been exploring opportunities in different groups.  

Was telling Michelle Nezi Marvin last week about my situation.  Coincidentally, she offered to introduce me to you for some good advice as to what I should do.  I was one year behind her at Wharton and look forward to seeing her in Philadelphia next week for on-campus interviews.

I'm actually enjoying London quite a lot, and so am hoping to stay here for the time being.  But Greg suggested I send you a copy of my CV as you might be have some good ideas for me.

Thanks.... and look forward to speaking with you, 

Betsy
