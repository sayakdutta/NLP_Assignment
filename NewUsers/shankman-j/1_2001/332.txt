I thought you already had me at the dinner.  I think I'm available.  Check 
with Jennifer

Attached below is a list of individuals that will be participating in the 
tiger team event at Enron in Houston on the 18th of January.  Keep these 
people in mind when it comes time to pick candidates to interview for the 
Spring.  Call if you have any questions and I am still looking for Wharton 
Alum who would like to attend the dinner at Churrasco's that same evening.  
Thank you,

Kristin
