Unfortunately, I cannot attend the meetings at noon.  Jeff
























Just a reminder that there is a board meeting on Monday, January 22 at 12 
Noon in the Cullen Education Resource Center.

Since this is a luncheon meeting, if you have not already done so, please do 
let me know TODAY if you are planning to attend or NOT ATTEND. I want to be 
sure to have a box lunch for everyone who is there!
