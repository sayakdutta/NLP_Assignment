I just spoke to my sister and she goes to the doctor on monday.  the baby's 
heart is the size of a poppy seed, and the baby is the size of a bean.  she 
and josh are calling it their "beanie baby."  isn't that cute?



Have a great evening--I'm out of here!

I know what you mean.  let's figure out when we both have some free time and 
maybe we can go to a fun dinner and blow off some steam.  



I think my head spun, then exploded.  Ditto on the busy part!  Trying to get 
Max and Chloe ready for their departure Friday, meeting with contractors, and 
work.  OY.

spinning....I have so much to do, I don't know where to start!
