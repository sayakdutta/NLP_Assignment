These are still good contacts, and I'm happy to approach them again.  
Thanks.   (for Mckinsey & Co. we should address Ron Hulme)








Dear Jeff,

I am working with our chairs, Claudia Lummis and Isabel Lummis, on our annual 
Gala.  I have been holding the following solicitation letters
until I spoke to you regarding the ask.  Karen Soh asked me to wait until the 
New Year.

Jack Cogen, NATSOURCE, $10,000 in 2000
Jeff Hawn, McKinsey & Co., $5,000 in 2000
Rocky Emery, Paine Webber, Inc., $5,000 in 2000

Please let me know how to proceed this year.  Are these contacts still good 
and how can we best approach them this year.  If you have other ideas about 
potential donors, please let me know.
Thank you very much for assistance.  I look forward to hearing from you very 
soon.

Sincerely,

Grace Pierce
Contemporary Arts Museum
Assistant Director of Development
