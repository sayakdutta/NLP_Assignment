Jeff,
I met with you in the fall & mentioned that my son had applied early 
acceptance to Penn for undergraduate.  In the craze of year end closings, I 
neglected to let you know that he got accepted this past December.  He is 
very excited & I am excited that the stress level in our house over college 
apps is over!!!  In any event, I would like to take as active a role as 
possible on the Penn/Wharton recruiting team.  Please let me know how I can 
help.  Thanks!
