BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE IN THE FERTILIZER INDUSTRY (SOURCING AND SELLING TO 
LARGE/INDUSTRIAL CLIENTS) I AM INTERESTED IN APPLYING FOR A JOB I SAW ON 
ENRON'S WEBSITE.  THERE IS AN OPENING IN THE "WHOLESALE, RETAIL & COMM ENERGY 
SERVICES" FOR A POWER REP IN NY. BUT, I AM AFRAID IF I SEND MY RESUME TO THE 
HUMAN RESOURCE DEPT, THEY WILL BE CONFUSED BY MY ENTERTAINMENT / FERTILIZER 
EXPERIENCE.  I WOULD LIKE TO ASK YOU IF THERE IS ANYONE YOU KNOW, AT ENRON 
NY, THAT I CAN MEET WITH PERSONALLY.  IN A MEETING I CAN EXPLAIN MY 
EXPERIENCE AND QUALIFICATIONS BETTER THAN I CAN IN MY RESUME.  I WAS VERY 
GOOD AT SOURCING CLIENTS AND ESTABLISHING LONG TERM RELATIONSHIPS FOR 
FERTILIZERS AND BELIEVE THAT I CAN TRANSFER THAT SKILL TO ENERGY.
BEST REGARDS,
RINA
