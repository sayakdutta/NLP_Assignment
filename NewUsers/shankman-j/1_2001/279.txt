Jeff, per my conversation with Caroline, it looks like they might like and 
could use an intern this summer in NY.  I think with both her and Per it 
would be a good experience, what do you think?

summer intern to do- also per is up here w/ syndication, softs, metals, 
credit, etc....

thats a very, very good idea.  i will consider that big time.  sure you will 
have enough stuff to keep them busy?

so you can't get out for one day of interviews in march?  btw, i heard you 
asked mog to come up to ny to help out.  very good choice, whats the status?

hey - i will not be able to get out- if one of the candidates would like to 
be in the NY office for the summer, we could probably arrange that..
