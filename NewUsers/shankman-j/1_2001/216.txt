Thanks for the email.  I was out of the office yesterday.  I'd be happy to 
talk anytime.  During the day, after 2 pm.  At home in the evening anytime.

Jeff,
Trust you are well.
I wonder whether you are available for me this evening on the 'phone for
3-5 mins.
If yes, is there a preferred time?
Alan
