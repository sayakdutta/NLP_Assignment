Dear Jay,

Here is the Jay Baker piece for our newsletter.  I like the way it
turned out.  I worked on it a bit...he is so proud of its humbleness and

ofcourse I love the fact that it is so understated but a few of his
initial comments were a bit much.  After all this house is extraordinary

quality   and as you know it is always harder and probably more
expensive to create something simple and elegant. See what you think and

call me or email with any changes and then we'll run them by Jay Baker.

Hope you love the house.

Julie
