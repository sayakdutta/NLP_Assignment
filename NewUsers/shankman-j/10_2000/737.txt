it seems the cnn/usa today poll always shows bush up be the widest margin.  
do they have a motive here?

FYI -- the CNN/USA Today poll today will likely  show Bush up by 13 points 
over Gore.
?
Recall that this is the wildly volatile poll,  however, and could, as it has 
in recent weeks, flip back just a  quickly.
