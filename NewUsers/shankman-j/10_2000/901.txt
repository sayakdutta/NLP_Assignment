Michelle, If you run into problems with finding mgr or above interviewers, 
you should consider assoc. to interview analysts.  I would also like to put 
Kevin McGowan (who went to MBA but isn't on the list, as an interviewer for 
wharton, in Phila if possible),  I'll leave it to you for interviewers.




















In preparation for upcoming interviews and other events, we'd like to get the 
Wharton Recruiting team together on Friday, October 13 at 1pm in 44C1.  It 
looks like this could be a huge year for Enron on campus because start-ups 
are no longer hiring MBAs by the dozen and investment banking is facing a lot 
of uncertainty as a result of all of the recently mergers.  To take advantage 
of this, we really want to get all of you involved in some aspect of 
recruiting, whether it be sitting on a conference panel, interviewing on 
campus or helping out here in Houston.  Please plan on attending the 
meeting.  If you can't make the meeting, please let me know what area of 
recruiting you are interested in participating in.  Our biggest need right 
now is for interviewers for on campus interviews on November 9 and 10.  We 
need 12 interviewers (Manager and above) for the 9th and 6 (VP and above) for 
the 10th.  

See you Friday,  

Michele Nezi Marvin
Manager
