It sounds so fun!  we will have to pick a weekend.  I have to wait to think 
of a good idea for the bet...not something lame.  how about a puppy!  just 
kidding...but that would be really fun.  anyway, I have a situation to talk 
to you about later.  I need some good advice.  



Your call on the bet.  I talked to my friend at Sat. Night Live, and she said 
no problem about being extras.  I'll get a list of scheduled hosts/bands--you 
pick!  (If that is still ok)

NO you won't!  I am dedicated.  Anyway, what are we betting?



Those dumb asses have now promised me my ab roller by tomorrow.  I explained 
to them our bet, and now they understand my problem...I WILL win...

yes...my mom left this morning, and I have three weeks to recoup before I see 
her again.  She is the nicest person ever, and I feel so guilty that she 
annoys me.  I am sure I will have a daughter one day who thinks I am totally 
annoying too.  what goes around comes around!  
are you better today?  what are you doing for lunch?  did anything good get 
delivered???



How's it going?  Recovering from family OD?

how about Ali "I hate PMS" Saler?



How about Ali "the impaler" Saler?  Or is that too dramatic?
