Talked with Cameron today, he is the university of Chicago guy who has been 
made an offer. He is excited about coming to our group. I will reconfirm with 
JAna and Charlene that his first rotation will be with us. He also expressed 
an interest in ending up in crude and products but did want to see other 
parts of Enron. Told him to do a good job and it would not be a problem.
