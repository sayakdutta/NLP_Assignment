Jeff,

Happy Holidays!

I met with the Wharton Club of Houston yesterday. The president is
Jon E. Zagrodsky, assistant principal at McKinsey. They are trying 
to get the club "restarted" again. They are planning on having some
social events next year, as well as some speaker events. The club
is partially supported by the school. I will be providing them with
the email addresses of all wharton undergraduates here at Enron, 
as well as in other companies. Would you like to be in their distribution
list? The club is for undergrads as well as for grads.

Let me know what you think.

-Hector
