I'm most likely heading out tomorrow night.  I think Rachel T is going solo 
to the Lay's, so I figure she should come with us--but she is away until 
tomorrow.  
Do you know someone named Melanie Herz?

my day is ok.  the only bummer is that I couldn't find invites that I needed, 
so I am having them designed which will be a royal pain in the 
ass....anyway....hopefully I will see you on 50.  I think I am supossed to 
volunteer with Misha from 4-4:30 in andy fastow's office.  are you 
stilldeciding between tomorrow night and thursday morning?  



I'm going to try to go to 50....day is packed, and still haven't decided when 
to go to NY.....How's your day?
