I've been told by Charlene Jackson that by now you should have received the 
following information from the A/A program:  1) list of Final PRC Reps for 
A/A's, and 2) A/A PRC Information/Guidelines.  

In case you haven't, I've attached information regarding EGM Associates and 
Analysts.  The information will be helpful to you as you are providing 
feedback to the A/A's Final PRC reps, particularly promotion nominees.  

If you have not discussed your A/A's year end 2000 feedback and pre-ranking 
with their Final A/A PRC Rep., please do so immediately.  The names of the 
EGM A/A Final PRC reps are listed in the first attachment.   Guidelines on 
promotions and details of the Final A/A PRC Meetings are shown in the the 
second attachment.

Please call me if you have questions.
