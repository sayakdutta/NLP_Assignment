Kay,

Here is the information that we discussed.  I will work with you on this regarding renewable energy.

Richard



























































The EPA Houston, Texas facility has issued a renewable power Request for
Information (RFI).  This RFI is attached and is posted at
http://www.fedbizopps.gov , under Solicitation Number GS-00P-02-BSD-0001.

Responses are due November 9. Respondents to this RFI will be kept informed
of the EPA Houston, TX renewable power purchase plans.

Let me know if you want to be removed from my renewable power purchase
mailing list.
