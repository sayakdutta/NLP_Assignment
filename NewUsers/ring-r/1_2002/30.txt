Chris,

Kathleen Croissett, Enron Wind Development Company, had contacted me asking me whether or not the agreement(s) were terminated.  EESI did not terminate the agreement(s) and EESI had not received any termination notices from Green Power Partners which is why I was trying to find out from you what you knew regarding the delivery of power from such facilities.

Late Friday I received a call from Lisa Pitts, Enron Wind Development Corp, however she did particularly say what she wanted.  I did leave a voice mail message for Lisa Pitts, however as of yet have not received a call back from her.

Richard:

Has Enron Wind told you they wanted to change SCs?
