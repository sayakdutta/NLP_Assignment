For some reason, the time management function on eHRonline won't allow me to 
log in. It says the user is locked and to please notify the person 
responsible. I'm using the user ID and password you gave me, so I don't know 
what I'm doing wrong. This is not an urgent matter - just respond whenever 
you have time.
