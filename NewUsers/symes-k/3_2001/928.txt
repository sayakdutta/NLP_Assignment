I feel your job-hunting pain, but I am so glad you sent a resume to Amy. And 
as for having to WORK at WORK? Not if they just let you go! If they ask what 
you're doing say, "I'm surfing the internet for a NEW JOB YOU SON OF A 
BISCUIT." And as for this weekend, most definitely. On Saturday I'm going to 
see some art and have drinks at the Medicine Hat gallery on Alberta. You 
should join me in my quest for culture - of course that'll last until just 
after I finish the first bottle of wine. Who's playing on Friday? I'll pencil 
it in. And I'll keep you posted on what I hear from Amy - in the meantime, 
hang in there. It all works out in the end. (there's your cheesy piece of 
advice for the day)

I e-mailed Amy my resume.
Looking for a job blows.  I am starting to feel the
anxiety of not having one soon.  Oh well, that's
life.  I can't do much from work because I have to
actually work.  Dumb.
Well hope to see you all soon.  Maybe this weekend
if you and Molly aren't busy.  There is a kick ass concert
at Berbati's on Friday night.  Yay!

Thanks again for the contact.

Jill
