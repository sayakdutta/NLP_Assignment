I will be attending an Energy Math training session today from 9 a.m. to 5 
p.m. PST. Please direct all correspondence to traders whose deals are in 
question. I'm sorry for the inconvenience - but hopefully I'll be smarter 
when I come back! 

I'll check in and wrap things up at 5:00, so if you have any questions you'd 
like to save for me, I'll be at my desk then.

Thanks,
Kate
