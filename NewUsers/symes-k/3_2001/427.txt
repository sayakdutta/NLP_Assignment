I suppose my victory in this, our latest but not last competition, would be 
IMPLIED. Rather, I mean that my triumph could be INFERRED or even TACIT. My 
skill is UNDERSTOOD, my speed INSINUATED, and my nimble pairing of the two is 
INTIMATED by the fact that I won this competition.

Now, I'll be sadly disappointed if you don't get this e-mail until later 
today, being that you have such a confusing and multi-layered e-mail 
situation, because I need for you to know that I got the answer first. So for 
the record, it is 8:45 a.m. on Monday. A side note: I also have The Great 
Gatsby in my possession.
