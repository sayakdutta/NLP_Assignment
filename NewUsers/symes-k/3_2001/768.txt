Yes, deal should have zero volume. Looks like Jeremy just didn't have time to 
kill it so he zeroed it out. I'll kill it, but in the meantime, it's not a 
real deal and doesn't need to be confirmed.

Thanks,
Kate

Hi Kate
This deal has 0 volume.  Is it correct?  if so, do we need to confirm it?
Thanks!
