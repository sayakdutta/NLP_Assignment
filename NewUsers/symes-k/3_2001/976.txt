I just got your fax - thank you! I'll start changing over those deals right 
now, so it shouldn't be long. I'll send you another e-mail when they're all 
done.

Hi Kate!
This deal needs to be changed to CAISO energy.  Also, I will be faxing the 
list of West Daily Deals that need to be changed to "no confirm".
Thanks for your help!
Kim
