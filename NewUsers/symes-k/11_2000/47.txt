Thank you, Evelyn. I've back-dated Deal #456173 to 11/9. Let me know if 
there's anything else I can do.

Can you please back date deal  to 11/09-00
 I spoke with PGET and they recognize this deal as brokered through Prebon 
also.  I am still waiting for Prebon to claim the deal.

Sean is entering the first deal as we speak. I will let you know as soon as 
we have a deal number.

Sean said he is sure the second deal was done through Prebon. No one is there 
right now, but he will double-check with them. Again, I will let you know as 
soon as we confirm this.

Thanks,
Kate

ISSUE 1
Prebon sent over a confirm for a deal traded 11-9-00 where:
Sean Crandall sells SCEM Dec'00 COB at $107.00 25 mw
I did not confirm this deal with them and I don't see it in the system.


ISSUE 2
Prebon is just now claiming  that they did not do this deal from 11/7/00.  
Can you please check Sean or Dianna book because I have it checked as 
verballed but now they are saying it is not there deal.:
Enron (Sean Crandal) buys from PGET 25 mw of NP-15 for 11/10-11/30 at $95.00
