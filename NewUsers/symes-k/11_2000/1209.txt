Mom -
Thanks for the heads up. I am having the same nightmare with US Bank that 
I've had each time I've deposited any money: they won't let me have it! I've 
been meaning to e-mail Anna and let her know, but that's gone by the wayside 
along with pretty much everything else since I started this new job. I tried 
to close my account on Thursday in a last ditch effort to get at my money, 
and they politely told me I could close it on the same day I could get money 
out of the ATM, which will be on Wednesday. Until then my hands are tied. I'm 
really sorry about this - I know Anna needs help, and believe me, this isn't 
very convenient for me either. I'll e-mail her right now, and send her money 
on Wednesday.

Give me a call later if you'd like to meet at the gym.
