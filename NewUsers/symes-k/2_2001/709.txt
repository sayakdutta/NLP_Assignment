Jeff Richter - all deals are on peak - do not recognize Sunday off-peak hours

Chris Mallory - 523831 changed to Bloomberg deal

Matt Motley - 524308 in trade log as buy Aquila/May-01/25 mw/Prebon at 
$260.00 - Matt is tied up in conference right now, but judging from the other 
May deals in his blotter and from his curves, this price is correct. $160 is 
about $100 less than anything else trading at that time. Ask Prebon where 
they got that from...

Thanks,
Kate
