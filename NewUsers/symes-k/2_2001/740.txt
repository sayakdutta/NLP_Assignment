Per your request for year-to-date numbers: here's an example of what I could 
include in the daily EOL summary. Let me know if this is helpful for you, and 
if you'd like it included on the graph sheet. I think it might be too tight 
to fit on the page as it is, but there's no reason why we can't generate a 
two-page report. As long as we're going in that direction, is ther any other 
data you'd like to see in graph form?
