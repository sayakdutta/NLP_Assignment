Thanks, Neil. They're on the mailing list now. And yes, it's hard to believe 
there are not one but TWO William Williams in our office.

Sorry typing to fast.  Chris Foster and Bill Williams of the real time desk 
(I didn't know there were two) 

NFB 





I'm sorry - I have no idea who Christer is - I'm assuming Chris Foster? Also, 
we have two Bill Williams - I assume you mean the real time manager, Bill 
Williams III. Let me know if I'm right, and I'll be happy to add them to the 
mailing list.

Thanks,
Kate
