I just spoke with Nicolay, who helped me develop the EOL Report, and he said 
he'd check the code in both that and the Sales Volume Report to see if they 
are in fact pulling in different data. I'll let you know what he finds.

Here's what's wierd:  I ran a Sales Volume Report for 2/21 only, and got a 
total of  596,284.

On your report for the same day,  I get a total of 1,468,175.  That doesn't 
include anything done by about 4 books that are supposed to be on mine!

I wonder what's up with that??  I just wrote to Duong luu to ask him about 
the sales volume report.

I create a report each afternoon that tracks total volume done by each desk 
through EOL and brokered deals. I've attached last night's report for you to 
look over - if this looks like something you'd like to receive, let me know 
and I'll add you to the mailing list. 

And in regard to the dow jones file, I've just finished entering deals for 
Friday and Saturday, so my afternoon will be devoted to creating that. I'll 
let you know as soon as it's done.



Thanks,
Kate

I am running a sales volume report, and am looking for a number to compare it 
to.
