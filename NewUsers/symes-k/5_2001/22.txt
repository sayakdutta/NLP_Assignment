This is an index forward, so for round-the-clock deals we enter more than one 
in order to have peak and off-peak hours settle against the different index 
prices. 596722 is the off-peak part of this deal, and 596723 is the on-peak 
part.

Let me know if this makes any sense.

Thanks,
Kate


   
	
	
		



Tacoma called and said this is a 24 deal for May 1. We have light load in 
system. Could you ask Diana which is correct.

Thanks,

Kimberly
