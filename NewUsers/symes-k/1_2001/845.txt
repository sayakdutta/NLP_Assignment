No, that's fine. But because of the new global standards, we're required to 
produce and report all corrections made on west power deals each day. So I 
was looking into these deals to get trader names, terms, etc., but 3 of them 
wouldn't pull up. 507901, 506767, and 507900 don't seem to be in the system. 
Are these the correct deal numbers? Let me know when you get a chance.

Thanks,
Kate

Thank you.  I think if I send these emails, they eventually pick the correct 
CP.  I hope you don't mind that I changed the deals myself.

Thank you for the reminder, Rhonda. I'm going to send out another 
announcement this afternoon to all our traders along with the daily 
correction log. Hopefully this will incite everyone to pay more attention to 
the counterparty names they choose.

Thanks again,
Kate

I have changed the following deals b/c the selected CPs are incorrect.  Also, 
please remember not to pick CPs in brackets as they are inactive.  Thank you 
for your help.

507842 should be Dynegy Power Marketing, Inc.
506767 should be NRG Power Marketing, Inc.
507900 should be PJM Interconnection LLC
506618 should beTransalta Energy Marketing (US) Inc.
