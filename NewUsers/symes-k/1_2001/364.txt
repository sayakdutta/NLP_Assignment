Both Mike Swerzbin deals were in incorrectly. We've changed them, and added 
the last deal for Matt Motley. 

495106
Off Peak

495175
50 MW

Matt's deal should show up any minute.

Thanks,
Kate

Mike Swerzbin

ref 495106
Prebon says this s/b off-peak not peak

ref 495175
Prebon shows 50 mw not 25



Matt Motley
I am missing the following deal per Amerex for Matt:
Enron buys EES 25mw Q3'01 PV at $275.00
