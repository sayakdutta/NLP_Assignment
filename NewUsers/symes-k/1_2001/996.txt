The graphs I've set on your desks are the product of a new version of the EOL 
Report. Please look them over briefly and determine whether or not the data 
this report pulled in is correct. I've attached a table of the data as well 
for another point of reference. If there are problems or discrepancies in the 
report, please let me know as soon as possible, and we'll adjust it 
accordingly.

Thanks,
Kate
