Okay - third time's the charm. After cuts were made by the Cal-ISO last 
night, I sent you a revised volume schedule of our sales to EES for 1/31; 
however, I failed to change the total load at SP-15 to reflect cuts. Now 
you'll see the CORRECT revisions made at all delivery points. Let me know if 
you have questions.

Thanks,
Kate
