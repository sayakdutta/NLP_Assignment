I checked in Jeff's trade log - he just stepped into a meeting - and 504970 
had been crossed out to show 50 MW. But 505118 only has 25 MW. Does this 
sound correct? I'm a little confused about what you're asking - should the 
deals match at 50 MW on peak? Or is one 25 and one 50?

the williams deals with apb at 215.00, should total 150 mw.  we are just 
missing 25 mw.








505118 has been changed to 1/26 -1/27. Still checking on missing deal.
