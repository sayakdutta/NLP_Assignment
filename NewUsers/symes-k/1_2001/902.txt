Yes, these are two separate, but identical deals. Thanks for double-checking.

Kate-
Can you verify with Mark that there were two identical trades done on Jan 8, 
2001

Enron Sells Southern California Edison
100 mws
sp-15
165.00
jan 10-31, 2001

We received an executed confirmation letter from the cp but the deal number 
is not avaliable (the fax machine cut off the deal number)  {just collecting 
all the confirms for the California situation.}

the deal numbers I have located are 492137.01, 492152.01
Just making sure  one is not a duplicate.
Thanks
