The EnPower IT group in Houston is making some changes to the EOL Report 
which in the long run will improve its functionality, but in the interim has 
left it temporarily disabled. I have left a message for Nicolay Kraltchev, 
the IT staff member in charge of the project, and he will be contacting both 
Carla Hoffman and me tomorrow. With any luck, this will be resolved by Friday 
evening and we can resume distribution of the report as usual. I'm sorry for 
any inconvenience this causes.

Thanks,
Kate
