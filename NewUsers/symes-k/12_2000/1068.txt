I figured you'd probably see Geir before I do. If so, would you check with 
him on these deals and find out if they should be with LADWPPX or Los Angeles 
Department of Water and Power? I have a feeling it's the latter, but I'd like 
to know for sure before I change the deals and eliminate the useless 
counterparty name.

Thanks,
Kate

There are several deals in the system for this month under this CP name.  If 
this is supposed to be Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, please 
change these deals and let me know when they have been changed.  There have 
never been any deals under LADWPPX and I would like to inactivate if we are 
not going to use this record ofr the California PX.  Please research and let 
me know.
