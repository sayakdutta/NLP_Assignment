Les Rawson has spoken with Doug Reiner at Willamette regarding this deal. 
They are in agreement now about the prices. Les said he usually has to 
explain the methodology a few times when he does deals with these guys, so 
it's nothing new. But in the future, Les said he'd prefer to contact the 
counterparty first to avoid confusion. His extension is 3924. You're also 
more than welcome to call me first and I'll track Les down. (I think I'm 
probably easier to get ahold of!) 

At any rate, I hope this clears it up. And if Willamette has any other 
questions, let me know.

Thanks,
Kate
