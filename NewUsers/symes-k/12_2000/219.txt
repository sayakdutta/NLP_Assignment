I got a hold of Southern finally, and Mark Watts is out until Monday. The 
assistant who I spoke to knew pretty much nothing about this, so he said he 
couldn't verify whether or not they would be willing to ADP the deal. But 
according to our traders, they spoke with Mark Watts yesterday afternoon, and 
he agreed to ADP the December futures deal.

If this still seems to be a problem, please let me know. Otherwise I'll plan 
on talking to Watts on Monday.

Thanks,
Kate
