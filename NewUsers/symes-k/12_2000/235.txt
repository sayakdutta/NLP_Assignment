I guess EVERYONE is going at a mad pace today, because we just checked with 
the Amerex broker, who said he's in the process of putting that second deal 
in - meanwhile his back office is trying to check out! What the...? So Amerex 
should see the second deal, identical to the first, any second. Let me know 
if they still don't check out.

Thanks,

Amerex shows this deal once and Mike Swerzbin shows it twice ref 477089 and 
477088.  Can you check with Mike and see if this is a duplicate of not.
