I actually did get that last e-mail, but somehow it ended up buried at the 
bottom of my in-box, just like so many other things. As far as the Blazer 
ticket trade, I believe I bought a call from you on the Laker game, and you 
bought the option from me on the Cavaliers - so I can choose to exercise on 
12/13 at 7 p.m., and you can choose to exercise on 1/16 at 7 p.m. In other 
words, no matter what happens, I'm going to both games. Got it?

As far as good stories from that night, I probably have the best, or at least 
one of the more hilarious, of those circulating the floor. And no, it has 
nothing to do with me. Ask me about it later, and I might be able to give it 
up for firm delivery of a seat at next week's game. Think about it.
