The APX called me today.  They are concerned we are sending them confirms on 
deals that we are doing with them.  Legally this is incorrect as we are 
transacting purusuant to the APX Master, not the Enron Master.  So, please 
try to remember to check the box for no confirms when you transact with the 
APX.
