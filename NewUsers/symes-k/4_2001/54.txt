Just to keep you up to date on this -
I was told to call Larry Joe Hunter today for our counterparty matchups on 
the May futures contracts. I left him two messages, but never got a call 
back. I wonder if he's out of the office? Anyway, I'll definitely get a hold 
of someone tomorrow - if I can't I'll just go straight to the broker - and 
we'll get this deal out of the New CTPY status.

Thanks,
Kate


   
	
	
		



There is a deal titled NEW COUNTERPARTY.  Do you know what the name is 
supposed to be?

Thanks!
