This is a Real Time deal, and that desk enters deals a bit differently than I 
do. When they initially do a deal, they enter it for a certain hour or set of 
hours. Then, if they agree with a counterparty to extend the deal to flow 
through more hours, they change the deal in Scheduling, not EnPower. The way 
to see the true volume of a Short Term West Hourly deal is to look in the 
"View Actuals" tab. If you look at this deal, you'll see that they extended 
the initial 5 MW at HE 11 to look like this:

HE 11 - 5 MW
HE 12 - 5 MW
HE 13 - 5 MW
HE 14 - 4 MW
HE 15 - 4 MW
HE 16 - 4 MW
HE 17 - 5 MW
+__________
 32 MW

Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Can you please let me know if there are other deals that go with the deal # 
referenced above?  We have a total of 32 MW but this is only for 5.

Thanks
Judy
