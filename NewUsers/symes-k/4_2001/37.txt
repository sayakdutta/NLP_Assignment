Chris -
Would you mind e-mailing Evelyn your contact information at the APX? And I 
can't recall whether or not we wanted to confirm these trades. Let me know 
when you get a chance, and I'll take care of it with the Confirms group.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate, have we started using this brokerage firm yet.  If so, do you have any 
phone numbers to contact them?  Also, do you know how we are going to confirm 
their trades?

Thanks
