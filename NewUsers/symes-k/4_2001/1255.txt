Okay - I won't be able to get out of here before 5 p.m., so 6 p.m. might be 
better. Also, I am car-free these days, and I completely forgot you wanted to 
meet east of the river. Would it be too much trouble to meet in NE - that's 
where I live, and there aren't any buses directly from SE to NE, 
unfortunately. Let me know if this works for you. Sorry for the hassle!

Sure. I know busy.
I suggest the Lucky Labrador Brewing Co., on S.E. Hawthorne at 9th.
I can do 4 p.m., or 6 p.m. Whichever is best for you.
