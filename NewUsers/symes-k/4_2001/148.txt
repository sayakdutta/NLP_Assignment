I've never seen anything but a .005 broker fee on Bloomberg deals. Tom Alonso 
wanted to know when that fee changed.......we're confused!

And the Matt-Bob deal swap - I guess it was just a last minute decision on 
their part, and they should have let the broker know. Matt said the trade 
needs to stay in Bob's book, and just to check it out as a good trade with 
EPMI. Let me know if you still have problems with this.

Thanks,
Kate

BLOOMBERG
Are you talking about the broker fee?
Yes the fee is $15.00 Flat per Bloomberg's confirmation on both of these 
deals.

PREBON
Bob said Matt Motley gave him this deal to do. Is that going to fly with 
Prebon?
I guess this is o.k. but they were insisting that this deal was done with 
Matt not Bob.
