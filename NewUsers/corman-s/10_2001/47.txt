My preference is to send out the notice as a Staff Meeting w/ Halloween Snacks.  I'd rather it be just us for this meeting.

 

Shelley,
39C1 is available from 3:00 - 4:00 pm on Tuesday, Oct. 30.  Would you like to have a social get together for your groups?  I was thinking of maybe a Halloween cake and ice cream social.  Maybe even invite marketing.  What are your thoughts?
