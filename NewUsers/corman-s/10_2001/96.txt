You don't need to keep the attachment.  I was going to read it online -- but since you've printed I'll take it along for casual reading.   I just want to add Liz Gras email address to my contacts.  Sorry for the confusion.




I printed the attachment & will keep in my folder for future reference.

(quite long)




Please add to contacts




Shelley,
I don't know if you've joined this group or not, but I they had some 
informative posts about Adoption Discounted airfare, and Taraz and I thought 
you might like to read it.
