I have been friends with Shelley Corman since 1985.  We have worked together and maintained a personal friendship through the year.  Shelley is a kind and loving person.  She is active in her church and in charitable activities.  I met her husband, Kim Erb, in 1997 and have been friends with Shelley and Kim as a couple since that time.  Both Shelley and Kim are loving parents to their six-year old son Chad.  It has been a delight to watch them raise Chad to be such a fine young man.  I believe that their home would provide a terrific environment for an adopted child.

Sincerely

Christi Nicolay
