Thanks for the invite.  Unfortunately, we have a customer meeting at South Shore Harbor that day.  

Hope you are doing well.  I haven't made it home to a football game yet this year -- although I guess that has been a blessing.

Hello Shelley:  Just an informal advance notice that the College of 
Earth and Mineral Sciences will host a golf tournament on Thursday, 
November 8, at Tour 18 in Humble, Texas.  A 12:30 p.m. shotgun start, 
followed by a Burger & Chicken buffet, is on tap for the day.  Hope 
you can join us.  Information will be mailed within the next week or 
so.
