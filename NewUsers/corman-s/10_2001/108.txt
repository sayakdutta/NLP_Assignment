Hi Ms. Traylor,

I gave my mom a heads up that "flat Stanley" would be arriving in the mail soon -- but it seems like
recent mail jitters are coming into play.  Before poor Stanley is needlessly tossed on fears of biological
terrorism could you confirm whether Master Stanley might be in a brown envelope?  I didn't have Ms. Jung's
email.

Hope all is well with you.  I am so pleased with how happy Chad is with school.  At first he expected to be 
coddled like Kindergarten and complained that 1st grade was too hard.  Boy how things have changed in a month.
Yesterday he told me that he was so happy that school was hard -- Kindergarten was soooooo boring.

I really appreciate the firm, yet compassionate manner you have with the kids.  It is just what Chad needs to develop.

While I'm writing, I will also mention one thing to you in case it comes up at school.  Over the summer we hosted
a 4-year old orphan girl (Alina) from Kazakhstan.  She had to return to her orphanage while we complete paperwork to adopt her.  The other day, Chad was watching TV and saw a picture of some Afghan children.  He commented how much they look
like Alina and then burst out in tears.  If the school works on a project for the Afghan kids, Chad may seem a little more emotional than usual -- just wanted you to know.

Regards,

Shelley Corman  (Chad's Mom)








Hi Shel,

Did you say that "Flat Stanley" will arrive in a white envelope?  I received 
a yellow envelope in the mail today with no return address, my name & address 
were typed and it had a "non-profit" stamp on it.  I did not open it.  It's 
in the trash can but the garbage man doesn't go 'til Thursday... I can 
retrieve it if you think it might be the envelope from Chad.

Love,
Mom
