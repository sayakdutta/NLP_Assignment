Do you know?



Hi Shel,

Did you say that "Flat Stanley" will arrive in a white envelope?  I received 
a yellow envelope in the mail today with no return address, my name & address 
were typed and it had a "non-profit" stamp on it.  I did not open it.  It's 
in the trash can but the garbage man doesn't go 'til Thursday... I can 
retrieve it if you think it might be the envelope from Chad.

Love,
Mom
