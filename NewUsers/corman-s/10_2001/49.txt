Thanks.  No-Notice Imbalances are market area from the perspective of commodity pricing.  The only reason that they are separated out from the rest of the imbalances is because of the transportation element of the cash-out price.



Okay.  I did not originally include the no notice quantities in the market area imbalances.  I or Galen can get that info from the monthly excel spreadsheets.  I will start gathering that data.  




I consider the no notice to be part of the market imbalance for this analysis.
