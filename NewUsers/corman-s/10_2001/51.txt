Great.  Last week I was invited to a forum, but I was disappointed that I could not attend.

 

FYI - I was selected to attend a facilitated focus group meeting to candidly discuss the current environment of Enron from a mid level management point of view.  If anything comes out of this meeting that sounds particularly interesting, I will let you know.  

Also, if there is a topic you would like me to comment on, please let me know your thoughts.
