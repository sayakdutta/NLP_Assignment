A couple of thoughts

-  Per travelocity Lufthansa does fly between Houston-Frankfurt-Alma Ata & then Moscow-Frankfurt-IAH.  We'd only have to take
Transaero one way from Alma ata to Moscow.

- If we fly through Moscow on way to Kaz, keep in mind that the airport we fly into Moscow will be a totally different airport than the airport we fly from Moscow to Kaz (the regional airport).  I have heard that the regional airport is not a very safe or American friendly place.

- I want to me flexible on travel.  But, I'd really, really rather not fly on Aeroflot.
