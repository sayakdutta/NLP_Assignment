Kevin,

Please call ASAP.  While I have been working through the theory on how to make this happen, but I don't know the details on which pipelines and which accounts.




Please change bank accounts for customer payments asap. We will get account numbers for you.



Also tell shelley to notify the customers to send the payments to the new accounts.
