Will call you at 9 tonight.




Hi Shelley:
Perhaps we can talk tonight about several things I need to coordinate with 
you.
(1)  Children's Church schedule for December.  I talked to Steve Hoyle, and 
he did not have a preference one way or the other about Children's Church for 
the Cantata Sunday.  He did say the music program was rather long, with lots 
of dialogue.  I am inclined to say let's have C/C, and I can commit to being 
there.  Of course, we need at least 2 others to commit as well.  Since it 
would be rather long, I would be in favor of supplementing the C/C service 
with a Christmas-themed video.
(2)  Have you looked into food from McDonald's for the Christmas party?  I am 
working on the invite's, and tentatively am putting down on the RSVP card a 
meal preference of hamburgers or chicken nuggets (check one.)   That way, we 
can go either way with Happy Meals or just the basic food and fries, 
depending on cost, ease of packaging, etc.  Let me know what you think and if 
you need help with looking into this.
(3)  I saw some cute "Happy Birthday, Jesus" themed trinkets in the Oriental 
Trading catalog.  If you think we need more things for the treat bags, this 
is a possibility.  They also had a cute plastic treat bag with this theme 
that was fairly inexpensive.  (I can't remember if you said you already had 
bags or were still going to get them.)
I could talk tonight after 9:00, if that is convenient for you.
Thanks, Shelley!
