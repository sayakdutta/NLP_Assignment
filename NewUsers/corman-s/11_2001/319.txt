No thank you for all you and your teammates do. 

 I get a bit frustrated when Stan says that "we all need to  re-focused back to work.  I need to remind him that we have never lost our focus, that despite what has been going on, our staff has continued to work 24/7 to maintain our service level to our customers.

 

I would just like to express by thanks and appreciation for the nice surprise yesterday afternoon.  And, thank you for always being professional and encouraging to all of us.
