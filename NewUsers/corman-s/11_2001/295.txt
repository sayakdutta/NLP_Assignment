I would like these individuals to have a training with Teb Lokey today or tomorrow.    Teb is aware of my desire in this regard and is awaiting your call to set up the time.




 

Shelley,  FYI--Rick & I have discussed how we will cover the reservation billing scheduled for Saturday.  Marion & Cynthia will assist us in the coverage as well as Jerry Skirtich who sat  with Galen & I on Tuesday to cover the ncessary steps to generate the billing process.  Galen has a "desk procedure manual" assembled that spells out in detail the billing process.  I'm working w/Larry Hill to ensure the Capacity Release transactions are fed to the old TSS system (still testing this process.)  I've expressed a great sense of urgency surrounding the invoicing process given the cash flow concerns we're dealing with.  Sheila 

 

Galen's heart catheterization yesterday showed two major blockages, one 99% and the other 75%.  The doctors at St. Lukes installed two stints in the artery to repair these blockages.  Galen said his chest is pain free and the tightness is gone.  His incision on his thigh is very sore and he has not yet been allowed to get out of bed to walk.  I spoke to him this morning and he sounded fairly upbeat and said he should be out of the hospital later on today.  He was concerned about whether he would be able to come in to work on Saturday to process reservation billing.   I assured him that Sheila and I had it covered and he did not need to worry about it.
