I had Kim run down to my office to sign the revised letter and so I can fedex tonight.

I am so bummed about Jan. travel date and not having Alina for Christmas. Is this for sure? Was she speaking just about me or was she saying Jan 1 for you too?   Why Jan 1?  If there holidays are Dec 30-Jan 1, then why shouldn't we set out to travel around then, so we could have our court date the first days after their holidays?

Sorry for all the venting!




Shelley,
Chris called while I was gone. She told my mother in law that it looked like 
the first of January for travel. She also said if you had already done the 
letter, to cross out and initial the change. I called her back and left a 
message saying that if it is indeed the first of January, then you will have 
time to redo the letter, and not Fed-ex it today. I will let you know when I 
hear back from her or Ginger.
Let me know you got this email please.
