Sorry - but it looks like you'll soon be saddled with a Blackberry
 

We'll take care of all of the approvals and will make this request happen.

Karon will get with Mike on the correct cost center information.

 

Steve/Karen,

I need for Mike to carry a Blackberry.  Please advise on how to make this happen for Mike.

Shelley Corman
VP Gas Logistics 

 

If you would like me to have one -- i would prefer not to have to ask Steve Hotte and Rod H for approval.

 
Cc:	Love, Chris

Dannis and Mike,

Due to Financial constraints in November and December, all orders were cancelled.  Therefore to reorder, I would need for you to send me an email with your SAP Coding, Business Purpose and Manager Approval.

I then take that information and have to get IT Director approval, VP approval, CIO approval and CFO approval - This is still in force and to replace your order, please send me the email.

Thanks, Karon
