Great.  Just wanted to make sure I was on the right wave length -- as Jane Joyce has asked the IT folks for more detail on the contracts and revenue projects and I didn't want to lead the IT folks astray with my understanding of our meeting if it was incorrect.





Shelley - I was waiting to see if other comments would be submitted.  I will respond today or tomorrow.  Although it should be a basic reponse that your comments are correct. 
 
Hope all is well.
