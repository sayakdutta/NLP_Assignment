Thanks for talking to Ange.  I'll give her a call tonight.

My preference is for me to take 3/17; you to take 3/24 (I'll have company); and no children's church on Easter.  Let me know what you think.

Hi Shelley:
I talked to Ange yesterday, and she and Bobbie can lead C/C this Sunday 3/10. 
 She stopped by my house today and picked up all the materials.  Sorry to not 
have told you earlier of my plans for this weekend.  It's all worked out, 
thankfully.
Let me know what you want to do the rest of the Sundays in March.  I'm 
available for any of the remaining Sundays in March, including Easter.  I 
know I owe you one, so let me know what you would like for me to do.
Thanks for a wonderful luncheon yesterday.  I think things are off to a good 
start with VBS!
Barbara
