I have another meeting at 3.  I'll join you late if I can.  I'm just finishing up my comments on the NNG business plan and will forward shortly.

This morning I discovered and forwarded to Teb/Rob the cases of several major pipelines (Trunkline & Texas Eastern) that converted to LLC status with no protests or conditions.  These were unpublished letter orders so they don't turn up on a Westlaw search.  Teb agrees that these provide a very straight forward road map for us.

 

Shelley:
We are having a meeting in 49C2 at 3:00 regarding the TW/NNG deal with Jerry Peters at Border. If you are available, please feel free to join us.
