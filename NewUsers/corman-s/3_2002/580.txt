John - please drop Mike a line about the Contracts system implementation on TW on Monday AM as Mike is attending Stan's staff meeting for me.

Shelley,
 A reminder notice was posted today for TW customers about the implementation of the new CMS/Capacity Release system this weekend. 
Just wanted to let you know that I was going to come in the office Sunday morning as back up for the TW group just in case there were any issues from the implementation of the CMS/Capacity Release system. 
Ramona, Linda Trevino and their team will also be in the office Sunday morning for support.

John Buchanan
