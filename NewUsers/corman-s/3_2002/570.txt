Mr. Chad is still sick today, but he much appreciated the bear.

I'll have my cell phone with me too.  We will be back on Fri. Mar 15.

Please look at your calendar to see if one of the following dates would suit for our shopping excursion:  April 4 or 5, 10, or 11.

FYI - Alina had her first MMR vaccination back in Jan and will have her followup in early April.  She purportedly already had all her MMR vaccinations in the orphanage but I am repeating just to be certain.

I've got an attic full of stuff for you and many, many Saturday's full of wisdom (and humility).  




I sure enjoyed dinner last night -- ice tea and all. For what it is worth, I
believe you made the right choice, recognizing it was not an easy one. Your
judgment is sound and you should believe in it. I hope you are feeling more
confident in your choice now.

Thanks for your words of wisdom to me. I am admittedly a bit scared -- since
I cannot control this situation very much. 

Just how did we get to be so Type A?

Have a wonderful trip. I will have my cell phone with me if you need to
reach me -- 713-557-8667. Also, the contact information for our condo in
Jackson Hole is Jackson Hole Racquet Club at the Aspens, 307-739-9050 (main
reservations number).

Take care, C
