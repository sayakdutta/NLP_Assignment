Thanks for your note!  I guess you're living proof that one can successfully make it through the twists and turns of international adoption.

 

I hear you're leaving Wednesday for Kazakhstan (sp).  good luck.  It will all work out great.  I'll be thinking about you and praying for you and your new little girl.  What a bright light in the midst of all this yuck.  Send me a picture if you get a chance.  I'm very excited for you.  Dari
