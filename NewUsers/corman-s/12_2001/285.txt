Thanks for your leadership on this issue.  The commercial staff has been very concerned about the lack of daily data and I haven't made much headway with the GMS folks.  I'm glad you are involved!

I will be traveling out of the country next week.  Others from my staff will attend and I'll catch up when I return.

Happy Holidays
Shelley
