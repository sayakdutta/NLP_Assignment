Hi Becky,

I'm thinking of you.  Cynthia Corcoran called today to see if I knew anyone interested in doing regulatory work.  I thought of you right away and Cynthia was enthusiastic, but didn't want to violate your privacy by giving out your email address.

She can be reached at 713-533-9180 or I can give her your contact info if you prefer.

Shelley
