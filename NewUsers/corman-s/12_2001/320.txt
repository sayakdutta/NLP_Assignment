Please remove my name from you solicitation list





Brian & I have been in contact with you for quite some time and we would
like to express our sincere concern for you.

In light of all the recent events that have taken place, we want to let you
know that we are available at all times to answer any questions, or to be a
voice outside of Enron.  You know you may contact us via e-mail or phone,
however, please feel free to use my personal pager (281.270.4901) 24 hours a
day/ seven days a week, if we can be of assistance.

Lastly, we would like to send a packet of information to you that I am
certain you will find informative.  Would you please respond back with your
home address and phone number?

Thank you and we will be in continual contact with you through the
developments.

Sincerely,

Charles Johansen
