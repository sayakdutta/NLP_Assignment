Thank you for your kind note.  Frankly with all the challenges our leadership team has faced this year, I don't have the slightest qualm that you and the other directors will  handle anything that comes our way.




Shelley,
 
I want you to know how happy I am for you being able to finally go to Kazakhstan and complete the adoption of your  daughter.  
 
While you are gone, please try to think about work and Enron as little as possible.  We will put in extra effort to ensure things go smoothly while you are out.  I will copy you on any important emails and data requests to give you something to read through when you get back to Houston.  
 
Enjoy your first new days of traveling with Aliana (sp).  I'm sure you both will be somewhat apprehensive about the travel arrangements and she will be looking towards you to see if she should be frightened.  On Sunday, I asked my Sunday school class to pray for your safety, for uncomplicated travel, and for patience while wading through the governmental red tape.  My family and I will be thinking about you and your family over the holidays.
 
Rick
