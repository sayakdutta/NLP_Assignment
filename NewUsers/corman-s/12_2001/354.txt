Catherine,

I have received the call and will be traveling to Kazakhstan next week to complete the adoption.  My husband and son are staying back.  I arrive in Almaty on the 14th late in the evening.   I'll spend the day of the 15th in Almaty and then take the overnight train to Taraz.  I expect to have a court date in Taraz on the 19th or 20th.  Then I will be back in Almaty, probably over Christmas.  Finally, I expect to travel to Moscow on around Dec 27 and then return to Houston around Dec 30.  This of course is the plan if everything goes exactly on schedule -- which it probably won't.

I will certainly miss being away from home at Christmas and am hoping to find a Christmas worship service in Almaty.   I'd appreciate any advice in this regard.

I would also appreciate advice on what time of clothes are appropriate to bring.

Thanks
Shelley Corman
