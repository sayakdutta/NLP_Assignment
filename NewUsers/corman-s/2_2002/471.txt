Saturday night sounds good.  My sister will be here!

Things are going fine at home...but we'll be happy to have Kim home!




Although it is only Tuesday, I am already trying to plan for the weekend.
John's brother Gib is visiting us and we were hoping to see you (sans Kim)
on Saturday for dinner ... at Lupe's? 

How is it going in Kim's absence? If I can assist in any way, please let me
know.
