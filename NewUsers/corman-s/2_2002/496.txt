I need you to work out a full budget for this class & the Houston class -- =
both the customer portion + the individual employee travel expenses that wi=
ll hit our budget.  Once you have the cost estimate together, lets sit down=
 and make sure we're okay from an overall budget perspective and then make =
sure that the participating staff know that we need to stick to the budget.

What did we put in the 2002 plan for the TW contract training?
