I'll await Mike's email.  Thanks.  






Shelley, first of all, I apologize for not responding in a timely manner.  I should have responded that we were waiting to gather additional comments, if any, and make one global response.  mea culpa.
Second, I received an email from Mike Mcgowan just a few moments ago wherein he is proposing a response to your request.  By copy of this memo, you can anticipate that Mike will forward a response shortly.
Again, sorry for the inconvenience.
