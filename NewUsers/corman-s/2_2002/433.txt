Hi Georgi,

It's nice to hear from you -- although I wish it were under happier circumstances from your end.  I know that your visited with Mike and Steve on gas control openings.  Please also keep in touch with Rick Dietz for contract group openings and Lynn Blair for potential scheduling openings.  I'll also touch base with them and let them know that you may be responding to upcoming job postings.

Hi Shelley!

Just a note to let you know that I have been looking for work and have applied and interviewed for several positions in gas control.  If you have any other openings available within the pipeline group in scheduling, contracts or accounting, I would appreciate any assistance you can offer. 

As you well know, I have a good work history and would be anxious to hear any input from you.  I really do need a job.

Thanks for your time.
