Oops my mistake.  I've lost track of my dates & was thinking that Winefest was several weeks off.  Its next week!




I'd love to but I will be drinking wine in Italy! Thanks for inviting me to
lunch today. I'm sorry I couldn't make it. I look forward to seeing you
Thursday night! Love, C




Would you be my guest?
