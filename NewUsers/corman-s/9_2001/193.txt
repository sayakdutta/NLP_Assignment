Letter looks good.  Just a few thoughts:

- In addition to the categories of feedback and promise to work on these areas, should we provide a list of specific things that we have done?
- Should we attach the first round of FAQ that matches questions from the meeting?

Instead of referring to the ETS directors - lets put Lynn, Steve and your phone numbers in the letter?
