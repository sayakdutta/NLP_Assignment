Yes - please reschedule for Tues.  Thanks

 

Shelley would you like for me to send out a message moving your staff meeting this Monday (1/21) because it's a holiday to 11:00 on Tuesday (1/22).  It's moved on your calendar and the conference room has been booked since we moved to 42.

Thanks, Ricki
