Sorry I'm so slow in getting back with you on your suggestion.  Nothing moves fast in the world of bankruptcy.  Before I left to go out of the country we had put together a proposal to the bankruptcy court to buy computers -- per Donna's note below the bankruptcy court hasn't acted on it yet.  I'll let you know if I hear of any opportunity for employees to buy computers.

Shelley,
Laptops and computers are not an option at this time.  The bankrupcy committee has not released them to sell due to their contents.  To date, we have only been able to secure flat screens.  We are still waiting to hear if employees can purchase flat screens, I assume you are still interested.  The committee has pushed the hardware liquidation topic back to the end of January.  We'll keep you posted.

Did ETS officially make a bid to the bankruptcy court for abandoned equipment?  Any computers or just flat screens?

 


    Shelley,

         I was shut-out of the click-at-home program before I got a P.C. ordered and was wondering what the status, is on some of the surplus
computer equipment that is still in the building. I am guessing that there is some left of the same quality or better, than that offered in the
program. Maybe you could start a after Chrismas gift sale. Because it was my idea you could give me mine for free  Ha!

                                                                                                                                                   Thanks Ron Spain
