Central Trading:

Jason Williams is an associate
Entertainment is too high for trading (s/b about $15,000)

 

Here is the Netco budget split out for your regions .  Could you please take a look at the headcount and expenses to make sure everything looks alright?  If there are additional items you would like to add (travel and entertainment looks low), please let me know.

Also, there are a couple people that belong to one of the Gas teams, but I'm not sure which region.  If you know where they belong, please let me know.

Deirdre McCaffrey - Manager
Don Black - VP


Thanks,
