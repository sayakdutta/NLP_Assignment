Chris & Kelli,  I just wanted to clarify that GRE's actual testing is 
scheduled to begin in March, and this Sunday is a one-day deal for them to 
blow down their turbines.  The powerpak deal that we have with them is for 
the testing period of March and April.  I have talked with our Storage team 
regarding putting the gas in on Friday and Saturday of this week and pulling 
out on Sunday but they are really tight and aren't sure they can handle it.  
Is there any way that we can buy the 4500 MMBtu for Sunday only? And, if so, 
what is the cost differential?  Thanks!

Kelli - the GRE deal is set to begin in May (per the long-term agreement).  
The interconnect is complete and testing will begin this coming Sunday.  GRE 
is responsible for noms during testing.  (As you may recall, ENA will be 
responsible for noms to storage once the deal begins.)  GRE wishes to buy 
4,500 MMBtu for this coming weekend. This purchase is not covered under the 
long-term gas deal; therefore, I presume you'll show GRE an offer at  Demarc 
or Ventura

Your contact (during testing) will be Janet Bowers (Omaha x7141).  

Please give Janet a call to arrange this weekends gas supply.  We may be able 
to sell/deliver the 4,500  on Thursday or Friday.

Janet -  Kelli can be reached at (713) 853-1828.

Call with any questions

Thanks
