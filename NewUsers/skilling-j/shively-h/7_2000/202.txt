As per our discussions earlier today, would either of you or someone in your 
area be able to spend an hour or two educating me on the various market 
forces in the Central Region.

I would greatly appreciate any help in learning more about this market.  
Please let me know what arrangements would work best.

Thanks,

Bill Brogan
