Dave, I wrote to Michael on April 30th, but received no reply. 

Its a little frustrating that all request need to go through you ? Why is this so ?

Michael, could you answer the following ?

Thanks

Colin,

Can you get me the XML schemas or DTDs for EOL.EOLPROD.DISTRIBUTOR.NEW_DEAL.SITARA and EOL.EOLPROD.DISTRIBUTOR.NEW_DEAL.TAGG?

I need to figure out the mappings for conterparty id, price, volume, etc.

Attached are the msgs captured on the TIB.

Thanks,
