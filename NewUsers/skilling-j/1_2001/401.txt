Shack, 

Thanks for the nice note.  Sorry for the delay in getting back to you, but I 
took a couple of weeks off for the holidays  immediately following the 
announcement.

The reunion was really great, and I'm sorry too that we missed each other.  
Next time you get to Houston, please give me a call (713.853.6894).  It would 
be great to get together and catch up.

Hope you had a great holiday and Happy New Year!

Rocky,
I saw the announcement of your promotion in the Austin paper a couple days ago
and wanted to send my congratulations.   I recall our freshman year, you wrote
your chemistry paper on energy, I wrote mine on semiconductors.  Little did we
know our initial interests as 18 year olds would become our careers.

Arends says he sees you regularly when you hold your financial reviews.  I
wasn't able to make it to his wedding.  Did you? If so, how was it?

Sorry we weren't able to connect at the reunion in October, I really hoped 
we'd
have a chance to catch up on what's happened since we last talked (maybe 15
years ago?).    Hope you aren't overwhelmed with the Beta egroups email 
banter.
It's been fun reacquainting with the brothers.  I'm getting together with Bill
Jordan next month in California on one of my trips.  I know you're busy, but 
if
you have a second, drop a reply.

I'm proud of your career accomplishments and our shared history and 
friendship.
Good work, worm.
Have a great holiday.
-kai-
Shack
