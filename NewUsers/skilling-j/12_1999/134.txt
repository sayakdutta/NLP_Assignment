Mr. Krings,

I received your voicemail this morning.  On December 3, I forwarded this 
information to Mr. Mike McConnell, who in turn sent it to Mr. Jay Fitzgerald, 
Enron's Managing Director of e-Commerce.  He is the appropriate person with 
whom to follow up.  He can be reached at 713.853.6161.

Regards,
Sherri Reinartz-Sera
Assistant to Jeff Skilling









Mr. Skilling,

I'm Glenn Krings with Sterling Software in Omaha, Nebraska and I recently
sent you a Priority mail envelope with a letter introducing e_CURE.  In
talking to your secretary, it apparently got lost in the shuffle, so I'm
sending it as an attachment via e-mail. e-CURE is an important new service
to help you reduce the costs of electronic data transmission or EDI.  It
further helps you to insure that the business rules in deregulated energy
markets are followed.

If you have any questions or if you need additional information about
e-CURE, please call me at 402-291-8300 x291 or e-mail


Have a nice day,
Glenn Krings
