Johnathan,

My name is Sherri Sera, and I work for Jeff Skilling.  Jeff has asked me to 
see if you have a completed e-mail list for Class #64, and if so, could you 
send it to me.  I'm assisting him in getting the group together Saturday 
afternoon or evening, and he would like to poll the group to see if that is 
something they would like to do.

I appreciate your assistance in this matter.

Regards,
Sherri Sera
Assistant to Jeff Skilling
