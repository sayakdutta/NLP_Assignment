our Eurasia Forum series:

TURKEY'S POLITICAL STABILITY with TANSU CILLER, FORMER TURKISH PRIME
MINISTER

Discussant: TBD

Chair: Ian Bremmer, President, Eurasia Group

DATE: Friday, 4 May 2001
TIME: 8:30am - 10:00am
PLACE: Eurasia Group Executive Offices
461 Fifth Avenue, 14th Floor (enter on 40th Street)
New York, NY  10017

A public row between the Turkish president and prime minister in
mid-February sparked market turmoil that resulted in an overnight 30%
devaluation in the lira and a crash of the IMF-backed stabilization program.
These events led to the resignations of the central bank governor and
treasury undersecretary and have tested the staying power of the country's
three-party government coalition.  In response to this instability, the
Turkish government appointed former World Bank Vice President, Kemal Dervis,
as the new Minister of Economics in hopes of resuscitating the country's
fledgling economy.

Ciller was elected Prime Minister in June 1993; her True Path party led
several coalition governments until 1996.  After losing her seat in 1996,
her party formed a coalition with the center-right Motherland Party which
was followed by an alliance with the conservative far-right Welfare Party.
The later move resulted in heightened tension between True Path and the
military and business establishment.  In the current financial turmoil, Ms.
Ciller has attempted to reposition herself as a force that will regain the
nation's financial and political stability.
