Mr. Skilling:

Your P number is P00500599.  For your convenience, you can also go to 
http://isc.enron.com/site/ under Site Highlights and reset your password or 
find your "P" number.


Thanks,

Could you please forward my "P" number.  I am unable to get into the XMS 
system and need this ASAP.

Thanks for your help.
