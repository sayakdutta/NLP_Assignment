Stephanie, I don't have all of Jeff's pledges collected yet!  Do you want what I have (about 65%) or shall I wait until all have been collected?  I'll send out another e-mail today to the slackers ;-)  Let me know.  SRS




If you haven't already done so, please turn in your MS150 pledges TODAY to either Stephanie Strong (EB2365c)
Becky Pham (EB2336b)
or Amelia Alder (3Ac3120).

Thanks.
