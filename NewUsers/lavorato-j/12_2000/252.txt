Can we take one of your wonderchildren in fundementals and let them spend 1-2 hours a day on VAR.  If yes, talk to Frank.

   
	  		





John,
Bilal reconciled Tom Martin's VAR, dropping it from $3.5 to $1.246. Texas desk VaR dropped to $3.8


Frank
PS.  Bilal has been very helpful in dealing with the VAR issues, and I think it has given him a better idea of what trading is about.  Would you consider sharing some of the analyst/traders, much like Bilal, for a couple of months, maybe longer, maybe mornings only, to help on VAR issues, as it relates to both power and gas?  I think it would be an excellent way to introduce them to VAR, systems, risk management and trading.  Let me know your thoughts
