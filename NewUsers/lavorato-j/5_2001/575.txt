I'm talking to Dave about Hughes reporting to Sally.
They don't need to even check the bill.  They can have a customer service g=
roup and if the customer calls the customer service group can deal with our=
 guys.

FYI.  From what I vave seen thus far I think it will be difficult getting a=
nything accurate or timely out of Evan Hughes' group.  This is the group th=
at is responsible for billing and settlements - the weakest link in our rec=
onciliation problems.  Unlike ENA Power, Retail has Deal Capture and Risk A=
nalysis under Sally Beck and the Settlements process under EES (Evan Hughes=
).  All three of these functions need to work together and feed into Wade S=
tubblefield (Wes Colwell) in order to get an accurate and timely reconcilia=
tion.  Dave has wanted to keep Billing and Settlements because of the "Cust=
omer Touch" they want to maintain.  I think this approach is delaying our g=
etting control of and resolving the issues that are keeping us from monthly=
 reconciliations and cash to actual liquidations.  I think EES needs to be =
given an ultimatum to 1) either provide us with a Settlements function that=
 allows us to flash and reconcile or 2) get out of the way.  We can provide=
 them with the bill and they can lick it.

Rogers,

I'll wait for Mike's response, but these should all be forward volume adjus=
tments as a result of truing up the volumes based on actual data received. =
 The past activity difference is captured in our potential flash to actual =
adjustment that we have pegged at a rough $75MM right now.  One of the diff=
iculties we have in reconciling flash to actual is the difference in actual=
 volumes versus volumes liquidated from the books/batch models.  With respe=
ct to how much more exists, this is one of the key items, I think, that the=
 Project Phoenix team will want to get from Evan Hughes' group to get the f=
orecasted volumes right.  My suspicion is that we need volumetric true-ups =
on many of our deals.

Again, let's verify the above with what Mike's response is.

Wade

Michael -

Are these changes in the forward volumes (unrealized losses).  Can you expl=
ain the reason for these adjustments?  How much more exists that we need to=
 address?

Thanks,
Rogers







20 Million !!!!!!  Is this back money or forward money.  Why did the volume=
s change so much.

We have re-priced Suiza, Packaged Ice, and Arch of Chicago with updated vol=
ume information from our billing system.  The impact is as follows:

The impact will be recognized on the DPR and G/L, pending Accounting Depart=

Thank you.
