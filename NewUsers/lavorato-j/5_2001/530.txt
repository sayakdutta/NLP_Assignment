 

When I submitted my list of feedback providers for (your) approval, I received the following message:

Your reviewers have been saved however, your supervisor does not have a valid internet email address in PEP. Please ask your supervisor to approve your suggested reviewers. Please click here to go to the Home Page <javascript:top.frames[0].goHome('../')> 

I would be grateful if you could you go into the PEP system and approve my reviewers manually, so that they receive my request for a review early in the week.

Many thanks.
