All,

Attached is the latest Roseville DASH with most of your comments incorporated.  We are hoping to finalize this by the end of the week, incorporate the final results from RAC and circulate for final approval early next week.  Please review and forward comments to both myself and Mark Fillinger by end of business tomorrow (5/3).  If you have any questions, contact either myself or Mark (415-782-7815).  Thanks.
