John, I read the Bloomberg note [or whatever they call it] that was on their
news site this a.m. Do they have a bee in their bonnet over Enron or what?
That is about as negative, if not personal, an article as one could want.
Normally when a company embarks on an expanded path to better use its
internal capabilities the market will first take a look at the recent
performance in making a case for its own judgement. Bloomberg seems to want
to ongnore your recent performance. After all one does not embark on any
vertical or horizonbtal expansion after a bad year, but when it can afford
the capital and time to do so before real results are generated.

So there. I did not like the article, nor the trone of it.

By the way did you like the dceg first quarter results?
