This is pretty sensitive stuff.  We should talk about whether we need to distribute it at all and if so who should get it.  I have no ideal why Heizenrader is getting it.
 

i haven't seen one of these in a long time.  then all of a sudden it shows up.  what is the standard for who gets to receive it.  for example, heizenrader is on the list but swerzbin is not.  any thoughts.
