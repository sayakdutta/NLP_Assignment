This week or next week.




OK. So I take it we will let Presto sign this week?



Send me a latest and greatest contract summary.
 
I think that Presto honestly just didn't have time to read his.  Other than him, I consider this process finished and all other outstanding documents expired.
 
When I rework the summary we will sit down and talk about it.
