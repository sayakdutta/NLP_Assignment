Good Job

Does EES have any exposure.






We actually forced Craig Breslau and Fred Lagrasta to unwind an unapproved one year trade with their subsidiary Savannah Foods in April 2000.  In hindsight, it appears to be quite a good call.

FYI, Imperial Holly Corporation filed for Chapter 11 protection yesterday.  Counterparties affected would be:

		Imperial Holly Corporation
		Holly Sugar Corporation


At the present, we have no trades with either of these counterparties.
