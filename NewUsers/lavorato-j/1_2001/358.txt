Dave,

Attached please find our 2001 Plan.  It contains things we think you will want to talk about.  It is intended to help frame the discussion during our scheduled time together this week.  If something you wish to talk about is missing please let me know and we will come prepared to discuss it on Thursday.

Thanks,

Kish

PS - I will be in Houston starting Wednesday (to do some performance appraisals) and Orlando will be arriving early Thursday morning should you need to contact either of us the next few days.
