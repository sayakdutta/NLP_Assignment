Dale,

Further to my phone call this morning, I have contacted John Watts at Avista 
requesting a copy of the Force Majeure letter they are sending to APEA.  I 
will forward this as soon as I receive it.  The event in this case is 
preventative maintenance.  It appears that there are stress fractures in 
certain of Clark's generation equipment.  GE is installing equipment to 
assess the problem.  The installation and removal of this equipment will 
involve an outage totaling 5 days over the next 2 weeks.  The question is:  
Is preventative maintenance a legitimate Force Majeure event under the 
APEA/Clark contract and thus under the APEA/ENGMC contract?

Thanks for your help,

Laird
