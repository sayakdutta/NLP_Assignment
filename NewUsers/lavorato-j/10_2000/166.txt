Stacy White informed me this morning there is discussions on moving all of 
the Power Hedges from the accrual book (approx $100 million loss) into the 
MTM books.  Is this true?

Do I need to be in the loop?

FYI - We successfully bought out of the 2001 supply commitment to OPPD at our 
mark ($4.7 million).  This leaves us with 3 customer deals that I would like 
to set aside as prudency C for East Power (not West Power or gas) for 
calender year 2001.   The 3 deals are MJMUC, VEPCO, and JEA.

Thanks.
