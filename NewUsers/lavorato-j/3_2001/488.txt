-  It doesn't need to hit the dpr.
-  Mike's job is not to respond to rfp's
-  If this isn't working then it means that there wouldn't have been agreement over money at the end of year - which is another problem 
-  Finally, I could of paid Mike half of what I paid him and he would still be sitting in his seat. He needs to figure out a way to be a team player and build the business.  We're not trying to build Stat Oil here.
-  If we don't reward our originators properly, we won't have any.

Having said all that.  If your marketers want to go back to the old system and risk getting underpaid, maybe that's the best answer.

Call me.

 

the numbers have been pulled out.  it was not possible to put it on the dpr for some reason.  that should be fixed this week.  swerzbin, wolfe, krebs, and malowney are all miserable.  mike is making life very difficult for middle market.  mike is now having is analyst, mike driscoll, respond to all rfp's.  life here is a lot more difficult than it was before we split the money out.  any advice?  do i just lean into mike?
