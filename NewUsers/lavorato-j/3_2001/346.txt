PS.  Joe, can you pick my team with the cheesie in the toe thing?  It sounds like a winner.

Chris;

Do you see what you can come up with when you put your mind to it! Great
idea, but I had this routine planned out whereby I show up last at McConvey'
s, and whilst everyone is busy choosing, I remove my shoes and socks and
very slowly, insert a large cheesie between each of my toes. I then stand
up, lift each pant leg about 4 or 5 inches, and proceed to walk around Rhode
Island's white carpet on my heels only, therefore attempting to keep orange
crumbs off his rug. I would make my picks in this fashion, bringing me good
Kharma.

I'm in if everyone wants to go this way.

Joe.
