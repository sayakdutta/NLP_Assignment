Can you follow up on this.

 


John,

Attached is a memo sent to me by Mr. Fabac, who works for Thomson CSF and reports to one of my best friends in France.  These guys are responsible for 9 Thomson plants in the world and would like to revise their strategy in power and gas supply.  They would consider a global agreement, or an agreement restricted to a lower number of plants.  They have 3 plants in the US, 1 in Mexico, 4 in Europe (France, Italy, Poland) and one in Asia (China?).  Their global average consumption of power is about 90 MW;  Gas and power consumption (and billing) for 2000 are detailed in the attached spreadsheet.

I suspect that we are intersted in this business opportunity.  Would you be kind enough to pass on this message to somebody who could take care of this (potentially) new account, or at least recommend a name to whom I could sent this information?

Remi
