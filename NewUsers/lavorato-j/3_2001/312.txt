Besides my chair - here is a list of stuff to chase down while I'm away.
 
Principal investing Miller owes me a hi - lo valuation of his investments and a meeting alone with him.  I thought that was going to be last week.  Set up the meeting for this week.
 
Set up the Oxley - Louise meeting is Friday moring, I need some time to prepare for it.
