I thought Eric was gas.  

Depending on the cost profile we would probably still do this.  The question is do you buy options on sites, buy sites, and whether or not you pursue permits.

John, we have now identified the resources necessary to identify potential development sites in Ontario. Our focus would be on the Toronto region with the intent of selling the site once permitted vs. building. Is this still something you want us to pursue? pls advise.




Please do ask Lavo about spending the money on this optionality (to develop a site with intention to sell not build).  We would do it for a 520 MW combined cycle and for the mobile units in  the Toronto region.  I'd like to either move forward or kill this, now that I have the resources lined up.  Thanks.
