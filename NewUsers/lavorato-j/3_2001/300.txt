I'm in Brazil returning that night.

You can decide if you can reschedule or not.

John sent me the index.  Get him to send it to you.

 

Great.  The meeting is Tuesday, March 20th at 4:00.  They are coming to our office.

Have you received the desired indices from Jon McKay?

thanks
Dave

When is the Gas Daily meeting.  I would like to attend.  I think I could help with the pitch.
