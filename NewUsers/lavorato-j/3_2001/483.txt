If Michael Moutlon wishes to pay for this I'm O.K. with it.  The memory business was never sponsored by North America.  Please get Michael to send me an e-mail acknowleding that he well pay.

John, Chris Calger stopped by just now to let me know you wanted some more information on the Masters.  I was intending to take Mitch Taylor, manager of Intel's  fab plant in Hillsboro, Oregon who has been extremely useful to Enron in helping to understand the memory business.  The memory trading group has used him extensively as a resource to get them started (Michael Moulton and others) - they support taking him to the Masters.  Please give me a call if you have questions or concerns.  Thanks.  Wayne.
