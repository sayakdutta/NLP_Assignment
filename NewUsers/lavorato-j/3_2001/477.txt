Thanks for your help on this.

 

FYI Folks-

The Kern River expansion that we backed out of (the 15 year stuff) is going to be 900,000 MMBtu/d.  As you can see a large number of the shippers stayed in the process, and are now bound to the pipe if it gets built!!

There will be a press release on this tomorrow...

Julie  :-)
