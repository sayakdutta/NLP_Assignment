I wish I could help.

 



To add an element of fun to tonight's hockey,  whomever is going against Brad should "team up" and make a concerted effort to  NOT allow him to carry the puck over the blue line. If two or three guys "rush"  him, he will be forced to "dish the puck" off to a teammate, which he HATES to  do on a rush. He is not happy unless he either shoots or makes a sleek,  goal-mouth pass. His natural arrogance will force him to try to beat all those  who challenge him. If you check him or he makes a bad pass, he gets furious and  is LOTS of fun to watch.
 
I, for one, am changing teams tonight just to do  this . If I succeed only once, it will have been well worth it!
 
REGARDS,
 
Joe.
