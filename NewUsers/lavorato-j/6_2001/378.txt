Great!!!

 

Following up our conversation - 

 - Garrett and Dana are in constant contact re British Energy and have no issues with extending the contract 
 - Paul and his team are "very confident" that they can roll the hedges and maintain the existing margin
 - They are 100% confident that they can hedge all 500MW's at say a $2 margin
 - Their plan is to hedge at least 400MW between now and november (new deals + rollovers)
 - We will continue to update both you and Dana before entering into any hedges
