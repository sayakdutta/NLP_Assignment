chapter 1 - public relations.

Go down the employee list from highest to lowest paid.  When you get to someone that makes under 60 K per year make them Enron Americas Public Relations person.

 

I would like to have a planning meeting tomorrow to begin coordinating the development of a strategic and tactical global plan with goal of being completed with that plan by Friday.  Let me know at your earliest convenience what time tomorrow works well for you.
Regards,
Jim
