Northland Power (a power plant operator) from Toronto has joined hand with Nepco to build a large cogen plant in BC with possible power off-take agreement for US Pacific NW (Washington/Oregon). Northland power asked me if Enron would be interested to quote indicative prices for this project. Would you please advise me with who is responsible for this kind of projects? Thanks for your help.
