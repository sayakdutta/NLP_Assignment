I thought I would give you an update on what I am doing from a systems 
perspective.  I'm trying to get a systems plan together from Beth.  We simple 
do not have one.  From there I will coordinate with traders and back office 
to try to create a plan that everyone can by off on.  My new motto is 
"Systems will be fixed or people will die".  I will keep you informed.
