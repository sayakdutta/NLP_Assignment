I quess this whole Nelson Ferries contract thing started before me.  However, 
I can't imagine that we can retract on it.  Please advise.

John,
I left a copy of Nelson Ferries contract with Kim Hillis.  Nelson signed this 
draft and returned it to me today.  Please advise on how you would like me to 
proceed with this contract.

Regards,
Jeanie

John, Jeanie Slone and I met with Nelson on Friday to discuss the contract, 
and I think that Nelson was seriously considering not signing it.  He told me 
that he would get a response to me on Monday(Fred L had given him a deadline 
of last Friday).  I do not have an email from Nelson or JEanie today so he 
may not have gotten back to anyone.  Jeanie, could you get a copy of Nelson's 
contract from Michelle or Twanda and drop it off with John?  Could you also 
touch base with Fred Lagrasta and see if Nelson has made a decision?  Thanks.

Can you send the contract to me.  I guess this one went out before me.
