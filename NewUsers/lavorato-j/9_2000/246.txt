I've told Presto to relax 17 times.  Just deal with me on this one.

Please give me an update on the overall status of Chris Dorland relocation 
from Calgary to Houston.  As Lavo has already indicated to you, Chris will be 
joining the East Power Trading group as the PJM cash trader.  Chris is 
anxious to get the process rolling so he can make the transition to Houston 
no later than October 2, 2000.  In particular the following package needs to 
be put together and overnighted to Chris this week.

 1) Visa paperwork (Canada to US)
 2) Relocation specifics (move coordination & $'s for move)
 3) New US salary (Chris expectation is $80k/yr US)

Please give me an update as soon as possible.

Thanks David.
