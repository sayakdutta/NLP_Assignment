Your going to be upset but we are playing Desert Inn on Friday.  Saturday TPC Canyons and some course on Sunday Morning.  Corporate jet home on Sunday Afternoon.  Call Me.

Oxley is coming to round out our Foursome.  You and Ox need to sort out rooms.

 

Sorry, I was unable to catch up to you on the weekend.  Look forward to hearing about Austin.  My grandmothers prayers are on tues night. I will be home on Weds. around 6;00 and then off to San Fran and L.A. on thurs/ Friday.  What are the plans for the weekend ?  I might need a raise if I am going to Jet around the country like a rock star.. 

Anything in the markets that I should be aware of ? 

Talk to you later.
