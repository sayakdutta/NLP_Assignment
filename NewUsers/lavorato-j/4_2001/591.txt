Along with all the questions that Louise asked, can I please see the resume.

This isn't the ex-metals trader from Koch?

What level is he?  What is the package - director or below?


   
 	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.  		




We would like to hire Willis Phillips from Koch.   Rogers, Dana, & I have all interviewed him and think he is a can't miss candidate.   The bad news is that he was referred by a headhunter (the fee is 20% of first year package).

This guy is quality and I want to make an offer.   Please let me know if I can proceed ASAP.
