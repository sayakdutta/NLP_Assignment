It's up to you but I might sell a little more 03-10

 

No I haven't sold anymore.  Given your concern about the selling gas beyond Cal 10, I bought back the Cal 11-15 piece on Friday.  I made $0.12 on it.  Derek is working on selling 50 MW to Powerex for 10 years out of 02 and we have 10 MW of customer deal for 5 years out of May 01 that is close to closing.  I will update this spreadsheet as changes occur.
