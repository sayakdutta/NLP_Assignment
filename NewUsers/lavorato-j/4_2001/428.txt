Liquidity feeds on itself.  PJM Cinergy and Entergy were not liquid until we made them liquid.

 

No to be overly defensive, but in very liquid markets (ie PJM, Cinergy and Entergy) the EOL bid/offer is 2.5-3.5%.  In the west MidC, NP,SP, the bid offer is 3-4.5%.  In a market it which I am 95% of the trades with no liquidity without me, my EOL bid offer is 4-5%.  I think the is very reasonable, if I felt that being tighter would allow more trades without me either being the repository of unwanted MW or being the only supplier of MW, then I would be tighter.
