Of course I agree.

Not playing any hockey and it's killing me.

Hopefully I'll see you next time.

John, 
Sorry I missed you on your recent visit to SAC.  I hope the visit was rewarding and offers good potential.  Gavin has told me about your meteoric rise to the upper echelon of one of the US's fastest growing and profitable companies...good stuff.  Congrats on your successes, and stay in touch with us, because this place is growing at warpspeed as well.
Funny, I was thinking about how much trouble and discouragement we both had in getting sales and trading jobs out of Kellogg.  Guess Goldman, et. al., weren't too bright after all.
Are you still playing hockey?
