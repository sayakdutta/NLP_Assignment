In order for the Enron Performance Review process to work effectively, it is essential that employees receive written performance evaluations. The attached list indicates Associates and Analysts in your business unit for whom we have not received written YE2000 performance evaluations.  Thank you for your attention to this matter.  If you need any additional information please do not hesitate to contact me.
