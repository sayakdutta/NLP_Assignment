Talk to Louise

 

John, with Pope officially gone, I need someone to run with retail. Dave Forrester (a canadian) had shown interest last year in returning to Calgary but needed his vp promo guaranteed (which we obviously couldnt do). With that now out of the way, what is your thoughts on me approaching him?
