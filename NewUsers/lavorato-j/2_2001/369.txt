I am of the opinion it will close Wednesday. Legal teams meeting tomorrow for final review. Municipal Resolution received and accepted by our legal today. Bank transfers being set up tomorrow for Wednesday 2 pm. But we have been here before. Will advise.

The municipality approved the outstanding issue and produced a resolution.  Haedicke needs to review the resolution.  If no issues in the resolution then we should close on Wednesday.  Mike is working the details...anything to add Mike?
