Thanks Peter

Hey did Mungo or Mongo are whatever the hell it is buy my house.

Is there any stopping you! (But I'm guessing your not getting out running much any more.)  I really appreciated it when you called me at home on my recent promotion, but thought you might just get pissed of if I phoned you at home (maybe not).  Anyway, I won't bug you at home tonight, and I will congratulate you here.  Very impressive, well deserved.  The realignment involving both you and Delainey should be great for the company.  Push the stock.  Peter.
