I don't care as long as I see them

 

Neil has approached me on the Duke trader candidates we had identified  Do you want to get the resumes when we get them from our consultant, or should they go to Neil Davies?  Copies to both you and Neil?

Neil,
	We are still moving ahead with our consultant to get the resumes of the Duke traders.  The bonus season at Duke occurs towards the end of this month, and all the candidates have explicitly told us that they are waiting to share their resumes only until after their bonuses are distributed.  We'll keep on top of it and advise.
