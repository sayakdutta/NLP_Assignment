Happy new year! 
For those of you have not heard yet, I am leaving Deloitte & Touche on January 10.  My articling time is officially in that day and I am heading back to Red Deer to buy my dad's water business.  I'm very excited about the opportunity.
You can reach me at my Deloitte email address until the 10th.  I have set up a hotmail account that I will use once I leave.  I start work in Red Deer on January 14.  Below is my new contact info:

Hope to talk to you all soon, 
Mike.
