The bonus structure was lined out in detail in a couple of HR video conferences we had with Houston. It is about 10X better than enrons.

 

Hey,

Does their description of the bonus structure concern you at all...may be payable, in part, in an equity award pursuant to the Firm's programs or plans. There is no choice like at Enron.

Let me know what you think,

Dan
