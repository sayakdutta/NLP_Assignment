what time did you want to go? susposed to do something with nic but if we went early that would be cool.


 

hey,

Wondering if you wanted to go for supper tonight.  I'd like to talk to
you about careers, etc, and I am gone for the next week and a half.  Let
me know if you have plans or whatever.

Chow.
