That is fine with me. I hate industry parties.

Thanx

Looks like we all can't go to the WEI party, see comments below

 

Liz,

As this reception is targetted towards the more executive level within each
company and because we have a venue that has a maximum capacity (and have
been receiving mostly positive RSVP's), we have carefully chosen the
individuals to whom we have extended invitations to this reception.  After
speaking with Brian Tanaka, he would be comfortable in extending an
invitation to Chad,  Stephane and yourself only.

Please call if you have any questions.
