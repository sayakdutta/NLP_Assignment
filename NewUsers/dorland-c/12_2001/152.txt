Too bad. Going back to calgary on the 26th.

 


Boarding was a no go as Brad had to bail for work.  I'm going to be in
panorama for new years with the family.  Wont be around much this year for
the holidays, next year will be spent in the 'Deer.  I will be here on the
26-28 of December, will you be around still?

Ryan
