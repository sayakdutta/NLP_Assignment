I made it. Thanx

Chris

 

Chris, sorry I didn't get back to you sooner.  As you know by now, the plane to Portland didn't happen.  I ended up driving to Salt Lake City and flying to Portland (I left Houston on Wednesday night and got in to Portland late Thursday night).  I hope you were successful in getting back to Calgary.  Regards, Wayne.

 

Wayne,

I was talking to Kevin Presto and he mentioned that you have a plane going to Portland. I need to get to Calgary and Kevin suggested I look into catching a ride with you and getting them to swing north and drop me off on their way back. Can you let me know when you plan to leave and if it isn't an inconvience I will talk to Lavo and see if he is OK with it.

Thanx

Chris Dorland
