I would like an indoor stall in Ernst and Young. Non-reserved.

Thanx,

Chris

Good Afternoon Everyone:

We have recently come upon an indoor parking opportunity in the Ernst & Young Tower as approximately 30 indoor stalls have become available.

Right now you are either parking in the Westin Hotel lot (paying $342.40/month) or in the Eau Claire Market lot (paying $300.00/month).  If you choose to take a stall in the Ernst & Young Tower, you will pay $353.10/month for an  unreserved stall or $401.25/month for a reserved stall.

Before making a decision as to whether you would like to switch over to one of these indoor stalls, please take a moment to consider the pros and cons:

Pro:							Con:

Indoor Parking						Outdoor Parking
							Price per month is Higher
							Month-to-Month Basis (Either Side Can Cancel with One-Month's Notice)*	
							Your Taxable Benfit Goes Up 	

Please let me know prior to Wednesday, September 19, 2001 whether you would like one of these stalls.

Thank you,

Megan

*Ernst & Young may cancel at any time at their discretion.
