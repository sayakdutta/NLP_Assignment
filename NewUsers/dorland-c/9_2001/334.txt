Hi Chris,  
  I am not sure why you wouldn't have received yesterday's ops package, my sent items folder tells me that it was sent out yesterday at 8:44 AM. Here  is the ops package from yesterday incase you require it for your records.

Sorry for the delay in the ops package this morning.  I will also have the updated Sumas graphs you require sent out as soon as possible.
