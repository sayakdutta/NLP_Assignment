Stalker,

I just talked to Milly and he suggested I get with you to talk about our position on Duke's aquisition of Westcoast. I just want to understand which regulatory body oversees the pipeline and what (if any) rules will apply to creating a wall between the pipe and Duke's marketing organization. Let me know when you have got a minute.

Chris
