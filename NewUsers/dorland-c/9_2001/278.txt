Just trying to bang a living out of this market. I get here at 6:30 everyday. I also leave at 4-4:30.




What are you doing at work at 6:30?




That is weird. Who would take the time to figure that out?

1.  Open Microsoft Word.
2.  Type "Q33 NY"-(this is one of the planes that crashed into the WTC).
3.  Select the text and change to font size 36.
4.  Now change the font to "wingdings" and then you will see.
