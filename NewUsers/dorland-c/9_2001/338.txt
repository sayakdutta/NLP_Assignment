Chris,
 
Here is the updated information you wanted.  The charts can be found in the "Sumas Graphs" worksheet.
 

Regards,
Ian Cooke
 

 
Ian,
 
Thanx looks good. What I was really looking for was the relationship between Sumas and each of those points for the N-M and A-O strips.
 
Can you put these graphs together for me.
 
Nov-Mar
Sumas vs. Aeco
Sumas vs. Rockies
Sumas vs. San Juan
Sumas vs. Malin
Sumas vs. Socal
 
Apr-Oct
Sumas vs. Aeco
Sumas vs. Rockies
Sumas vs. San Juan
Sumas vs. Malin
Sumas vs. Socal
