My month to date P&L is incorrectly showing (300K) on the P&L report because they haven't transferred all of the deals out of the BC book into Lambie's book. I am told that this won't be done untill next week? because Brian Gillis is out of the office. Just so you know I back of the envelope calc. my P&L at about 225K MTD.
