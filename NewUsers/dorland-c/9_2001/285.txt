Megan,

I haven't bought a car yet but I will let you know when I get one. When do we get the stalls in E&Y?

Chris

 

Good Afternoon:

I am in the process of setting up your new parking stalls for the Ernst & Young Tower.  Please e-mail me a list of all cars you may drive to work.  I will need your licence number and a description of the car.

Thank you,
