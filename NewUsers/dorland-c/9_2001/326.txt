Carlos,
 
If he is in Houston don't count on him doing it. I won't be getting out of here untill tommorow at the earliest and I am thinking it is going to be Friday or Saturday.
 
Chris




Chris,
 
    I will get risk to do that once your book has been completely emptied and all of the deals you have done plus the Station 2- Aeco Spread position has been moved into the book, there is an excel model we can run that dumps all of the deals in the book into a spreadsheet, until then however I will list all of the deals you have done and will send them to you.  Gillis has been in Houston, I am expecting him back today (possibly tomorrow).  
 
Hopes this works.  Let me know if you need anything else.
 
Carlos




Carlos,
 
Could you run a report that shows all the deals in my books (Financial and Gas Daily) as of close of business on Friday (Sept.14). I doubt I will do any trading over the next couple of days but you should probably wait until tommorow afternoon to run it.
 
Thanx,
 
Chris





No worries amd I will make sure your book is clean and ready by the time you get here!

Thanx for the pos report. Would you mind sending it to me each morning? Also, can you make sure that they have all of the deals (other than the few I have done) transferred out of my book by the end of the week. I talked to Brian? and he said he would look after it but can you make sure it happens.
 
Thanx,
 
Chris
