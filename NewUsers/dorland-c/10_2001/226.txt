Last trade 0.70. Success has worked for me so far.

 

He screwed me... sold at $0.40 but I learned my lesson (couldn't get out of order)...

but don't be so brash man... "Success is a lousy teacher. It makes smart people think that they can't lose." - Bill Gates

 

Sorry to freak on you. I'm a little stressed. Do what you think is right but never use market orders on option. It is a free option for the market maker to fuck you.

 

Ya, ps... I'm dumping me options... press is for shit today

 

Did I send you this?

 



 

this is pretty sweet...
