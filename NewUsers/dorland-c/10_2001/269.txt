Stephane,

Can you please set up a flexible template in excel so that we can fool around with the numbers on our X forecast and make copies of the historical data for the last 3 winters for everyone. I would like to have this done today so I can see the finished product before the meeting. Let me know if you have any questions. 

Thanx

Chris
