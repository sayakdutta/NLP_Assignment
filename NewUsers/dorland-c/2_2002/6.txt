Are these change meant to keep me from losing 30% again this year?

Chris
 

Yes I did.
Please give me your correct address so I can mail you the copy of the cheque.

We will forward all mail to your new address instead of your parents from now
on.

I would like to make a few minor switches to your portfolio.
