A lucent phone will be fine. I will only be on the desk for about 7-8 days so don't go to too much trouble. Do you have Keith and Frank's flight info for their trip to Calgary on Sept. 7 ? I will be there that weekend as well and want to coordinate my return with theirs.

Thanx,

Hi Chris,

Mike Grigsby has told me that you will be seating with the West Gas Trading Group for a couple of weeks beginning Sept. 1.  Will you be working off of a laptop for those two weeks?  I will make sure that you have the connections you need at the desk you will be sitting at and I will have a lucent phone setup for you.  Please forward me your extension, current location and badge number so I can setup the move.  Let me know if there is anything else I can do for you.  

Will a lucent phone be okay or will you need to be setup on a turret?
