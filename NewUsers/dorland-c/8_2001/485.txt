Now that I have a place to live all I need is a chica. I am going to a wedding in Red Deer next weekend and there should be plenty of available young ladies there. How is Mike McD? Are you married yet? Any kids on the way?

 

15 min door to door max. That doesn't include bringing me brkfst







I looked at the MLS listings and there is some stuff on there. I have a
realtor who seems to have her act together. Don't worry about it. How long
would it take me to get to work from there?

    
            
   Do you want me to cruise around this weekend and get the low-down on the
   different places and their cost?




   
            

   I already have a minature goat. I am a little concerned about making a
   housing decision in one day but what the fuck.

       
                        
      Oh I got the tire guy, the brownstones have very small lawns, perhaps
   a
      miniature goat may be in order....I think lambie may have one..He
   should
      give you one since your probably going to be his boss...




      
                        

      Done. I'm moving in! Can I borrow your lawn mower? I need to decide
   what
      I
      am going to do with my ride. I think I am going to bring it with me
   and
      buy
      a set of winter wheels and some killer winter tires. Don't you have a
      tire
      guy?

          
                                    
         1 block away....




         
                                    

         Lee Clarke... Sounds like a fag. Garrison woods that is the place
   my
      mom
         was talking about. Do you live near there?

              [Dorland, Chris]
                                                
            Nice brownstones in garrison woods, the remodeled area of
      altadore,
         that
            area offers lots of options from apartment condo's to houses to
            townhouses
            etc. Kerri? Haven't seen here for a while, hear she is pretty
      serious
            with a
            guy named Lee Clarke....




            
                                                

            I really want to live in Altadore. I hear that is where all the
      fly
            bitches
            hang. I don't know to be honest Killarney / Altadore / West
      Hillhurst
         ?
            Close to downtown. I am thinking infill / townhouse. My mom has
   a
         friend
            who says there are nice brownstone townhomes in Altadore. I am
         thinking
            of
            checking those out. I am looking for minimal maintenance. Do
   you
      have
            any
            ideas? Seen Kerri Murray lately?

            CD

                
                                                            
               Where do you want to live, which area, condo/house?




               

                                             

               Actually lots. Keep this on the QT for now but this kid is
      moving
            back
               to
               cow town. I'll be in town next week shopping for somewhere
   to
         live.
            Just
               in
               time for ski season.
