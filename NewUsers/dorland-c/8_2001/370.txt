I'm not very excited to hang out with Mikey all the time. See what Johnny is up to and hit the Benson and Hedges menthol's.




 



I don't know dude.  Leslie just told me she wanted your number as she is going to TO.  Hopefully it's soon.  I would really like to here a story about how the two of you went out for a glass of wine in TO.  Then she had 1 too many, spilt on her top, then asked to go back to your place to wash it out.  She then put one of your old T shirts on while it was in the wash.  You guys proceeded to have a couple more drinks.  When the shirt was finished drying - you were both pretty drunk.  She went to give you the old shirt back  - and didn't put the new one on.  You started to neck.  One thing led to another and you ended up smokin' a Benson and Hedges at 2:30 eastern time with a lovely red head lying on your 'coyote' arm - you are lying there thinkin', "I can't wait to call Marsy and George and tell them I nailed that hot chick from the wedding - and I was fantastic!"
 
 
Sorry dude, she is hot and my mind started racing,
 
Do us proud,
 
Georgetown.




No, when's she coming to town?
