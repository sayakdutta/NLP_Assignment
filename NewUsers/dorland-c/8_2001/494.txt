Not good. Listen to this. At the end of the day dailies traded down to 85 bucks. Check that range 85-275. I need a vacation.

 

How is that weak baboon heart of yours????

 

The range on my next day power was 110 to 260.

 

I'm losing a bit this month too.  Fucking cash to futures too tight!!!  Need the weather to break.

Call me tonight and I'll tell you about my Realtor.

 

Want to hear about a bad day. Down $2 million USD today. Temps came in 10 degress hotter than we thought in the Northeast this week and blew up!

Sounds good man.  We should maybe talk on the weekend.

 

I think a mid sept tee time will work. I want to try to be there for the off site with the west guys. Tell John Z I'll call him this afternoon.
