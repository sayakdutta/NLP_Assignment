Congrats on the CFA. I am actually fighting back today. How much time a week would you say you spend on yard work? I am thinking that I will go with a place more like yours. Let me know what you think. I am going to have to get Monica back.

 

Oops.

Hey, Mac and I are CFA's.  It is good to be done.

 

So much for being bullish.
