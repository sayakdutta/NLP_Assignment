I bought a brownstone in the River Park / Altadore area. #402 3511 14a St. SW. A really cool area and a great place. We will have to grab some sushi and catch up when I get back.

Talk to you soon.

Chris

 

Wow, that is massive, I can't wait for you to be back in Calgary!  Where did
you buy the house?

Look forward to seeing you.

Kerrie




Kerrie,

Congratulations! I actually heard the big news last week from Jill (of
course) but I have been meaning to drop you a line. I was in town last
weekend for Matt and Jen's wedding and while I was there I bought a house
in Calgary. I'm moving back on September 15th to trade gas again for Enron.
One again congrats and I'll give you a call when I get back to town.

Chris

    
            
   Hi Chris,

   I hope you are well keeping cool in Houston!  I just wanted to let you
   know
   that Leigh and I got engaged atop Mt Temple last weekend.  I wanted you
   to
   hear it from me.  I would love  to hear from you when you get a chance!!
   I
   am spending all my time right now deciding on a honeymoon destination!!

   I hope all is well.

   Kerrie
