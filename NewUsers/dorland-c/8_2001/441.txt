Hey there neighbor. Bought a house this weekend #401 3511 14a st. That is pretty close to you place isn't it. You'll have to drive by and check it out.

Oh well, more fish in the sea, Oh well.







I just heard from a mutual friend that Kerrie Murray got engaged recently.
Scratch that one off the list of possibles.

    
            
   Funny that's what I was thinking...




   
            

   I was thinking of converting it to a hover vehicle. I might just sell
   the
   car and get you to drive me around all winter.

       
                        
      How about skidoo skis for the front and tracks for the back..




      
                        

      Lexus IS 300. Not sure if I am going to buy 17" or 16" wheels for the
      winter. Jackass.

          
                                    
         Not sure about the wheels, I believe he sells some recycled from
   used
         furnaces...I'll check on the tires, what's it for, model etc, do
   you
         have
         tire size?




         
                                    

         If you are bored try to find out what your tire guy thinks of
   Dunlop
         Winter
         Sport M2 tires. Is you tire guy also a wheel guy? I need some
   winter
         wheels
         as well.

             
                                                
            Keep out of that fat category, that's all mine.....




            
                                                

            I was confused by your use of 2 spellings. Did you like my
   Austin
            Power's
            reference? "I know. That's how we do it in Belgium. It's called
   a
            Belgium
            dip" You are back in my good graces. Try not to confuse the
   dumb
      fat
            kid.

                
                                                            
               Wasn't questioning the chica's, like the term, thinking out
      loud
         as
            to
               any
               available on the scene for the kid....




               

                                             

               Fuck you. That's how we spell it in Belgium.

                   
                                                                        
                  With open arms...Chica's? I was at a wedding this weekend
      with
            tons
               of
                  chika's it was ridiculous....




                  

                                                      

                  Coming to town Thursday for the weekend and hopefully
   moving
      by
            the
                  middle
                  of September. Spending Friday house shopping. I think I
   am
         going
            to
               end
                  up
                  in your neck of the woods. Seems like the best values are
   in
         that
               area.
                  Are
                  we going to get some snow this winter? We need to find
      Dorland
         a
               date. I
                  am
                  going to a wedding this weekend and there should be lots
   of
         single
                  chicas
                  there. I am really looking forward to being back in Cow
      town.
            Houston
               is
                  painfull.
