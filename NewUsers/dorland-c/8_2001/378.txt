We were talking about getting matching PT cruisers with CRUISR1 and CRUISR2 personalized plates.

 

Why don't you get cowan to get you a deal on a PT cruiser, I heard he loves
those things....







Listen to this shit. If I want to move my car back to Canada I (Enron)
would have to pay $2000 USD to move it plus 6.1% of KBB value in import
duty plus 7% GST plus $200 excise tax plus about $400 in permits. Looks
like I am looking for a new car as well.
