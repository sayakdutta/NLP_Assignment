The LT-SW book was not officialized last night.  I have officialized it this morning.  We still need to be careful regarding officializations for credit purposes.

Here is today's list.  I have open questions for:

Heidi Mason
Brian Gillis 
Jenny Latham
Michelle Bruce/Todd Hall/Frank Prejean (liquids, coal & weather)
Jeff Gossett
Stacey White
Sheila Glover
Sheri Thomas

You can filter on your name to see which books I have questions on.  

If you can call me or write me an e-mail as to the status of the book(s) (whether it should have been officialized or not), I'd really appreciate it.

Thanks

Shona
