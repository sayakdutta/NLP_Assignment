Yes, she is actually down here right now and I am showing it to her.  Send me your names and I'll print them in color for her.

Should we have Sonia do this for this move?
 

Jeff, please ask your assistant to enter all data but not to submit the churn.  The only thing that would change is the final location for that person.  

Thanks a million for the quick turnaround!

With gas risk names in.   << File: _6th floorplan 01 301.xls >> 






Do we need to have our assistant put in churn requests,  or wait until this is all settled?

Attached are the excel floor plans with this morning's information.  Please utilize these as a working tool to put names on seats.  Hopefully Presto and Lavorato will not make major changes to the layout.  

Operations on the 6th floor are between 401 and 494.

Please phone me with any questions.

Regards,
Tammy
