Dear All,

	The Gas Database will not be available this coming Saturday and Sunday Morning, PortCalc will not be able to evaluate any Post ID due to the lack of Interest Curves, etc.

	Please let us know if that is a concern ASAP.

	Thanks,


Norman.

 

TAGG/ERMS/CPR database will be down from

January 5, Saturday at 8AM to
January 6, Sunday   at 12 noon

so that database maintenance can be made
for Netco by Mable Tang.

e-mail me if you have any issues otherwise a
no reply means it is ok.
