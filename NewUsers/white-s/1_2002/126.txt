Are the numbers in Canadian $'s?  If so, can you send me conversions.

Thanks,
Stacey

 

Thanks
I have moved deals where Houston has the master to an Alberta ENA terminations book (the postid is 15872 for Jan 10th.  Counterparties in the book are BP, Coral, ElPaso, Maclaren, Mirant, and ECC.  (I still need to move the ECC deals).  I think you would need to consider this book anytime you are doing termination calculations for any of these counterparies.

Let me know if you need anything else.

Stacey,
Would you be able to send me a list of ENA terminations.  I am going to start moving the deals to the Alberta ENA terminations book
