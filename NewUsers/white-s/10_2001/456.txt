It was wonderful.  Not so excited to be back - I'm sure it will get better as the week goes on.  How was your flight?  Did you feel safer?  They want me to go on the London Doorstep in November, so I was just wondering.

I forwarded to Murray to get some back ground info. These deals don't show up in flash or any desk analysis reports either.
 
How was the week off?

Can you check into this?

Do you remember what was going to happen to these deals with the cap of 150.00? Will they be clearing anytime soon? 
 
Thanks
