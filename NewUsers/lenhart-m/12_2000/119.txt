it was good to see you too.  we should have partied some more.  it is tough 
to stay in denver for too long now b/c of work.  i think that website is 
classmates.com.  i am not sure b/c some girl here was on the website and that 
is where i saw dana's personal ad.  i was so funny b/c lisa wimbush said " i 
am 24 and engaged"  and dana said " i am 24 and single".  everyone at work 
was laughing.  i hope you are having fun in san fransico.  keep in touch.
