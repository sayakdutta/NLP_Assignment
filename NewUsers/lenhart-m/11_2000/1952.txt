definately let me know when you come into houston.  there are a lot of fun 
bars around town here.  what happened to you on sat?  i was hurting on suday 
driving back.  that is the worst part of going back.  i heard oxford is fun 
to party at, but the fans there are assholes.  have a good time and keep in 
touch.
