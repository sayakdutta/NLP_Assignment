if anyone is up for getting some drinks at woody's tonight i am in.  i am 
going to test my new theory out tonight: hot school teachers don't have 
anything to do in the summer so they go out to try to meet guys with careers 
that can support them.  it is actually just a hypothesis at this point, but 
sierra on wednes. has added support.  let me know if you are in. and remember 
it is the in the name of science.
