I made a few changes from on the Socal forecast:

1.)  Put in the updated PV, NP, & SP power curves - now the generators are 
running at peak levels
2.) Increased Ehrenberg from 1.2 to 1.25
3.) Took off the weather adjustments when the new SP generation begins

The new forecast brings Socal storage to a max of 86 Bcf before Q3.  We can 
discuss this further on Monday.
