i lost your number in austin.  i tried to give you a call last night and 
clear up our argument  from saturday.  that got way out of hand and i 
apologize for that.  there is no reason for me to be such a hot head about 
that.  give me a call when you get a chance and we can clear up that mess.  
your parents got your stuff yesterday.  let me know what you want to do with 
that tv.  talk to you later.
