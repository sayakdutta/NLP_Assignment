things are going well here.  nothing much is new in houston.  my life just 
seems to be work.  actually it is a lot of fun here.  mitch, val, and tim are 
here so we golf and go out a lot.  what are you doing at your new job?  did 
you change into a new field or just jump companies.  is natalie working?  
shoot me back an email when you get a chance.
