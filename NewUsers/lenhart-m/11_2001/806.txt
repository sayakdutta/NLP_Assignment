they inked the deal.  dynegy has aquired us.

 

Well, hang in there. We are all thinking about you. Wish you could come
home. Talk to you soon.




dynegy trades around their assets.  they aren't big risk takers like enron.
looks like the deal is now done.  now we just need to wait and see what
happens.

    
            
   Sorry to hear that. I read where the treasurer and a corporate attorney
   were
   canned. I still feel the trading unit is somewhat elite in the business
   and
   that whoever takes you over will realize that. What is Dynegy like. Good
   capital with Texaco/Chevron behind them.

   
            Subject:


   sorry i didn't call you back last night.  i didn't get home until late.
   looks bad over here.  everything was business as usual until yesterday.
   i think our books were so cooked that it is beyond repair.  i will call
   you later.
