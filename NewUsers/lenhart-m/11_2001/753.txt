excellent idea.  meet you at my house then.  great.

 

ok, so would you rather me just meet you at your house?




we are meeting these people sunday morning at 10:30am to go to the golf
tourney.  i will have to pick you up around 10 or you can meet me at my
house at 10.

    
            
   whatever, you're the perverted old man.

   
            

   you love it when i come over.  i satisfy your appetitie for lovin.

       
                        
      very funny.  whatever, you had plenty of covers.   if you're so
      miserable
      maybe you just shouldn't come by anymore.

      
                        

      that isn't snoring, that is the sound of my teeth chattering b/c i
   have
      no
      covers.

          
                                    
         how would you know, you always fall asleep in like 2 seconds.  you
      are
         the
         one who snores.  very annoying.

         
                                    

         i am tired.  you snore.

             
                                                
            it's not going to zero.  you need to think more positively.

            

                                    

            it is going to zero

                
                                                            
               nice.  i just talked to fayez and he said it will be up next
      week.

                                                                        Subject:
