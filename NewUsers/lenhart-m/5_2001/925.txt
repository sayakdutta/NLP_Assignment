you didn't have fun at the small town wedding?    i had to go to one in 
mississippi this weekend.  it was actually fun.   vegas was two weekends 
ago.  that was a blast.  work covered everything so i lived like a rock star 
that weekend.  where are you moving?  maybe we can get drinks or something 
this week.
