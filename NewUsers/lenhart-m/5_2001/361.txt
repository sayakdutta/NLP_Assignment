Elizabeth,

Matt has given me verbal approval to have you change the pricing on the following
transactions.   

	1. SITARA #576162 should be $10.50.   Currently it is $12.35.



Please see the original e-mails below.
I would like to get this booked in May 2001 accounting, so let me know as soon as I can re-draft.
Thanks,
Doug  x3-0560

Matt,

Attached are the audio tapes from PG&E regarding two Jan 2001 sales price discrepancies.
The $12.35 vs $10.50 issue relates to SITARA #576162 (first audio file below).
Allen King has said there is no way he would have paid $12.35 at MALIN on that day.
Please see rows 182 & 183 on my attached spreadsheet....is it possible that 
SITARA #576162 was copied from SITARA#575575, but the price is different? 

The second audio file below relates to SITARA #573532 where Allen says the 5,000 is at $8.85.
We show the whole day (1/19/01) at $8.90.....see rows 158 & 159 of my attached spreadsheet.

Please advise....let me know if you have trouble playing the audios.
Thanks,
