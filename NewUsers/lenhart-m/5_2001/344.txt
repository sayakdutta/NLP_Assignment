i am excited to watch it.  so you got a promotion at work?  that is good news.  what is your new job going to be?

 

They looked unbeatable. The Devils looked like shit but if the Avs play like

nintendo doesn't count for your handicap.  how about the avs.  that was the
most impressive game they have played all post season.
