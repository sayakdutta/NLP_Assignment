i knew you would bag me again!  if you have to work there is nothing you can do about that.  i am going to baton rouge on saturday for an engagement party.  i will probably go out on friday.  when do you get back from chicago?  give me a call and maybe we can do something next week.

 

the wedding was okay. you know how it goes...they all start to blend
together. what did you do last weekend? you're going to kill me, but i am
most likely leaving for chicago (for work) on thurs.....what are your plans
for the weekend? we can get together next week?




nothing is going on here.  how was the wedding this weekend?  i am still
trying to rest up from the weekend.  are we going out thurs or are you
going to bag me?
