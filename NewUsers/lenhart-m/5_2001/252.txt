i thought that was your area code.  kind of freaked me out.  you can be a little crazy sometimes.  just kidding.  don't mess with texas is good.  it is about to get really hot here.  we reserved a room at comfort suites.  i think that is where everyone is staying in the caymens?  i am looking foward to it.  should be a blast.  when is the bachelorette party?  what are you guys going to do?  

 

My area code is 954....I'm not your stalker....How's Don't Mess with
Texas?....what's up for your summer?
