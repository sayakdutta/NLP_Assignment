i think i can make it tonight but tomorrow night the hockey game is on.  i need the  range.  just send your resume when you get a chance.  enron is looking for a ton of people.

 

I got in late and I forgot to send that stuff. I'll send it to you tonight.
You need to let me know what they are looking for.

Are you going to the range this week? I can maybe go tomorrow afternoon
@7:00p

Thanks,

Mitch Marcantel
