my friends are liars.  this past weekend was an anomaly.  it isn't bad to go out and party like a rock star every now and then.  i will be in austin this saturday night, so maybe we can get together in austin.  we will probably be at it pretty hard again.  i have a friend coming in from new orleans so he will want to hit 6th street.  

 

stop making excuses- your friends all said that you're
always very drunk every weekend. ha.
i'm back in austin.  i did have fun sat.night- it was
worth driving in for:)
i'm about a quart low today; i drove back on sunday &
spent the rest of the weekend on the lake.  i need to
go home.
why are you coming up this weekend again?  for some
reason, i can't remember.
