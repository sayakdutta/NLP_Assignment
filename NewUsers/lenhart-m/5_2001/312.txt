my boss doesnt have kids

 

i have a type and she fits it.  you obviously didn't know who she was.  so is your boss going to make you take out her son?

 

what, did you not mean to 
anyway, about the girl.  i dont know why i dont think she is your type.  the more i think about it the more i notice that you really dont have a type - so who knows.  the game was good, we lost 6-2.  4 of the padres runs were homeruns. we suck.  

 

nevermind.  so why didn't you think that girl was the type i go for last night?  how was the game?

 

what??
