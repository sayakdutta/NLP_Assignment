i was in new orleans for tim blanchard's wedding.  we watched it and then went out in the french quarter.  i will probably watch the game this saturday at woodrows.  i don't think i want to drive in for the game.

 


the weekend was pretty good.  one of my friends was in from austin and 
some of us went to Cafe Adobe and Sherlock's on Friday night. 
saturday night i had a date - dinner and then to downing street. 
i had to work all day on sunday. 
what did you do?  did you watch the game at woodrow's? 
 
thurs night was ok.  we went to taco milagro.  that place is full of old 
folks now.  how was the weekend?
