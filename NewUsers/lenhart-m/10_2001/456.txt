i'm not driving in for the game either.  a lot of people are though. 
let me know what ya'll do for the game. 
some people are going to a happy hour at Baker Street Pub on Wednesday - if any of you 
are interested. 
 
i was in new orleans for tim blanchard's wedding.  we watched it and then 
went out in the french quarter.  i will probably watch the game this 
saturday at woodrows.  i don't think i want to drive in for the game. 
     
               the weekend was pretty good.  one of my friends was in from austin and 
   some of us went to Cafe Adobe and Sherlock's on Friday night. 
   saturday night i had a date - dinner and then to downing street. 
   i had to work all day on sunday. 
   what did you do?  did you watch the game at woodrow's?

   folks now.  how was the weekend?
