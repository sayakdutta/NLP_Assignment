step up and go out like a man.  stop crying like a lil' bitch.   sierra is gonna be packed with girls dressed like lil hookers.  go home, nap and then be ready to go by 8:30-9.

 

Fellas, I'm pretty much having the most difficult week of work I've ever
had, so I propose that we drink heavily Friday night . . . I think this is
a wise choice to ensure that our livers don't go into shock due to a lack
of alcohol in our system . . .
