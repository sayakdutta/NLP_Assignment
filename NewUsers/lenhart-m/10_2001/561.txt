i cannot make it.  my parents will be in town this weekend.

 

We are planning on doing Nick's bachelor party this Friday night in NOLA. He
has a wedding shower on Sat. night and I am trying to see who all is going
to be able to make it. I know there has been a lot of wedding stuff going
on, but this is still Nick's turn and I hope that if you could be there then
you will be there. The tentative schedule is to start off with some
Monsoon's at Port of Call then go to Harrah's for a little while and
eventually hit Larry Flynt's Hustler Club. I need to get an accurate count
of who is going to make it in. Please send me a response on whether you will
be in attendance or not as soon as possible.

Thanks,
