i am thinking of going to woodrows again and partying on sat like last time.  do you want to golf sat?

 

I'd like to go to the game, but I'm scheduled to be here on Sunday afternoon
to finish a project that goes live on Tuesday morning. I don't know if I
want to chance it with a deadline. I'd have to leave right after the game
and leave crowley early the next morning. Also, a shitload of construction
went up on i-10 this weekend b/w Lake Charles and Crowley. traffic would be
bad again. fuch it, it's on the deuce anyway.






i am definately staying in town.  i don't feel like battling that traffic.

    
            Subject:

   I sold out on Saturday. I got called by work right after I talk to you
   and I
   didn't get off my cell until after halftime. I missed the entire first
   half
   to of the game. Do you know if Boone or anyone taped it? Did you get a
   stripper to go back to your place with you?

   Good thing no one rode with me. I had to stay in C-town last night until
   8:00p.

   Also, I may be fucked for next weekend too. Let me know if you are
   staying
   here. After next weekend, I'm coasting for work until next year.

   Thanks,

   Mitch Marcantel
