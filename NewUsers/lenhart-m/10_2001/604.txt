i havent looked anymore.  i will look this weekend.   i think i need to pay more than i want to.  how old is your dog?

 

whatever, you don't have to believe me but i did get a dog yesterday.
melisa and i went to lunch and then went and got the dog.  she took the
afternoon off so she kept it until i got off work. now do you believe me?
have you found a place to live yet or are you going to be homeless?




i don't believe you b/c i don't think you would not have had time to get it
yesterday when you said you had it

      she isn't imaginary.  her name is bailey.

      
                        

      this situation reminds me of kids with imaginary friends.  what is
   your
      imaginary friend's name?

         i got plenty of sleep.  my puppy is a perfect angel.  i am not
   sure
      if i
         am
         ever going to let you see it since you don't believe me.  you
   should
         trust
         me.

         
                                    

         did you get any sleep last night with your new dog?  when do i get
   to
         see
         this alleged dog? you probably got one of those robotic dogs.
   what
      is
         its
         name?

            no, i would win that bet, it is just annoying that you keep
   trying
      to
            get
            out of taking me to dinner.  i am not letting you out of it.

            

                                    

            why?  don't you think you would lose that bet?

               stop trying to get out of the dinner.

               

                                             

               lets bet your dinner on it right now.  i think i might need
   to
      pay
         up
            to
               get a house
