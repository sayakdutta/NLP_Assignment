      alright, i guess i'll have to let you see it just so i can prove i am
      not
      lying.

      
                        

      i guess i do but i wouldn't be suprised either way.  you can show me

         i don't know.  why are you asking me all these questions about it?
      do
         you
         still not believe me?

            i am not lying.  i know i said yesterday that i got a poodle
   but i
         was
            just
            kidding about that part.  i really did get a chihuahua.  i
   really
         don't
            understand why you don't believe me, it makes no sense.  have i
      ever
            lied to
            you before?

            

                                    

            now i know you are lying.  yesterday the lie was about a
   poodle.
      why
            can't
            you just be honest with me?  the lies and deceit hurt me erin.

               i didn't get a poodle, poodles are worthless dogs.  i got a
            chihuahua.
