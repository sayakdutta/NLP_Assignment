i hope he doesn't publish this and respond to it today.

 

Let me start off by saying YOU MYOPIC, NEARSIGHTED LITTLE FUCK.  Have you
ever been to Tiger Stadium on a Saturday night?  Have you ever heard the
Tiger Band from Tigerland play as the Tigers take the field?  Were you not
there in 1997 when we beat the shit out of the then ranked #1 Florida
Gators?  If you didn't write about sports, would you still feel like a man?
I bet the answer to all of these questions is a resounding NO.  You never
hear any other columnists or coaches banging on other venues within their
conferences because of the respect and pride they have of their own
conference.  You don't deserve the SEC and you don't deserve to write about
it.

I hope you are at the game Saturday night.  Win or lose, a few things will
definitely happen.  1)Before the game, you will get a rush hearing the Tiger
band make their way to the stadium.  2)You will get a rush when the Tigers
run out on the field.  3)You will hold your ears like a pussy when you hear
a crowd like you've never heard before.  4)And lastly, you will wish you
went to LSU.
