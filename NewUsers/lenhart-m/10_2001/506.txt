what are you doing tonight?

 

that shouldn't be a problem.




don't worry.  you and jen just need to be ready to party.

    
            
   good, glad you're excited.  don't forget to bring some fun stuff for us.

   
            

   i will.  i will sleep in the middle.  sat is going to be the best day of
   my
   life.

       
                        
      i did not.  i got up and when i came back you were sleeping happily
   in
      the
      middle of the bed.  i almost had to go sleep on the couch.  you are
      going to
      have to be more considerate sat. when 3 people are in the bed.

      
                        

      i slept on the edge.  you kept tugging on the covers and tried to
   spoon
      with me.  its cool though.

          
                                    
         whatever, you were taking up the whole entire bed last night
   making
      it
         impossible for me to fall asleep.

         
                                    

         stay at your place even though you are a bed hog

             
                                                
            what's that?

            

                                    

            yep.  looks like i found the formula.

                
                                                            
               are you having a better day today?

               

                                             

               you are so mean.  why can't you be sweet like me?

                   
                                                                        
                  whatever, i know you were kidding, so was i.

                  

                                                      

                  just kidding.  you need to relax a little.

                      

                                                               
                     you are a jerk

                     

                                                               

                     i am going to the strip club.  do you want to meet me
      there?
         i
               will
                  get
                     you a lap dance.

                         

                                                                        
                         you'll be fine

                        

                                                                        

                        i resent that too

                            


                                                                                 
                           why? it's true.  i resent the fact that you
   can't
      be
            honest
                  with
                     me

                           

                                                                                 

                           i resent that last comment

                               


                                                                                          
                              exactly, see, worthless.

                                 whatever, from now on i just won't listen
   to
            anything
               you
                     say.
                        i
                              will
                                 consider everything that comes out of your
      mouth
                  worthless.

                                 

                                                                                                   

                                 it is so easy b/c you get all worked up
   and
      you
         are
               not
                  sure
                           whether
                              to
