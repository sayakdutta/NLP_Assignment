should have taken the bet and given the points.  i didn't hear from you when i offered that.

 


I am watching the fourth quarter of the 9th Ranked Texas Longhorn as
whipping of the 14th ranked Colorado Buffalo.
I am very dissapointed - I had one of my to-do's this week was to send you
a note to take another $100 of your dollars by giving you the 10 points -
it looks like you would have needed 30+ though.
Either CU is OVERRATED or more like The Horns are some bad ass hausses.
The truth is that The Horns can beat any team in the nation any weekend.

I would enjoy the ass-whipping the Horns would lay on the Cajun Bitches
from the Red Stick (lsu sucks).

I guess being a Colorado Coonass means you get punked by the Horns twice -
CU and Lousyanna State both being inferior to the Horns.
