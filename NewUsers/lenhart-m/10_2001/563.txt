not much.  i am trying to sell my house so i have been looking for a new house recently.  there are some cool things that i have found.  i have been going out a little, but not like we did in the beginning of the year.  that was fun.  when i move i will throw a big party and we can start it up again.

 

wow, that was terribly poor grammar... you will have to excuse me, i am a bit tired. yes, jury duty does suck especially when its for 6 days in the middle of 3Q earnings. i haven't been going out much. this weekend sue and i went to new braunfels to meet up with some friends. what have you been up to?

 

your last sentence sounded like an indian speaking english.  i was wondering why you didn't respond.  jury duty sucks huh?  have you been going out at all?

 

hey, how are you? sorry, i didnt respond sooner... i was in jury duty all last week. still undecided on india. priya is contemplating staying even longer even things here are the same come june.

 

lisa lisa- 

what have you been up to?  you still moving to india or is your buddy moving back here.
