i think the only way to burn it on my cpu is download it and then burn it.  what is xp?

 

I don't know if you've seen it yet, but one of the programmers that works
for me burned me a copy of XP a couple of weeks ago . . . don't really know
how he got his hands on it, but it's pretty cool . . . I have to upgrade my
burner software due to compatibility issues . . . is your burner software
Roxio?  If so, I need you to burn me a copy . . . I'll burn you a copy of
XP if you're interested . . . the first 64 byte OS
