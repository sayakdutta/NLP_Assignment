our going out contest.  are we starting that tonight or do you concede?  i don't know why she thinks i am high maintanence.

 

why does she think you are high maintenance?  what contest?




i just heard that before and tori was joking w/ me about that.  i don't get
it.  are we starting our contest tonight?

    
            
   i don't know.  why

   
            

   do you think i am high maintanence?

       
                        
       you make no sense.  you said i looked exactly like her.  i think
   you're
      just saying that now b/c i think she's ugly.

      
                        

      i dont think you look like her anymore.  my judgement was off that
   day.
      i
      was around paint fumes looking at houses.

          
                                    
          i doubt that.  you better not be telling people you think i look
      like
         her.
         it's embarrassing.

         
                                    

         tori over here thinks bonnie is a hottie.

             
                                                
            you better not.  you better not EVER tell anyone about that.

            

                                    

            oh.   that is different than your first response. quite
   different.
      i
         am
            going to email your friend jen and see what she thinks.

                
                                                            
               ok, she didn't say she was ugly, she said she saw a
   resemblance
            between
               us
               but that i was smaller and better than her.  i agree with
   her.

               

                                             

               your mom didn't say she was ugly.  stop lying.  i think that
      girl
         is
            hot
               so
               i don't care.

                   
                                                                        Subject:

                  well, i asked my mom if she thinks i look like that
   bonnie
      girl
            and
               she
                  thinks you are insane and that i should never talk to you
      again
            for
                  insulting me so badly.  i told you that girl was ugly.
