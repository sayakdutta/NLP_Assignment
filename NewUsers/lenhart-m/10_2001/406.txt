you kept rolling back over and laying into me.  you are the one who said you wished i was dead.  you went crazy.  you were pissed all night.  you were venting on a soap box for about 2 hours.

 

i was not going nuts.  i was trying to go to sleep and you kept bringing it
up.  you're nice, but you have an attitude.  very cocky.




i was being nice.  you kept starting it and then blaming it on me.  you
were going nuts.

    
            
   you deserved it b/c you are a jerk.  you really need to start being
   nicer.

   
            

   you were letting me have it.  i deserved some of it b/c i made some bad
   jokes, but overall you were pretty brutal.  i think i am heading to
   baton
   rouge for the game this weekend instead of partying for halloween.

       
                        
      no.   why was i mad?

      
                        

      you still mad at me?  you were pissed last night.

          
                                    Subject:

         you better be getting excited about dinner.  i'm not taking you if
      you
         aren't.
