TX Team,

This is to express my sincere thanks for your October 26th appreciation and award. I was out of the office on business 
and did not receive the award certificate until this morning. I also want to thank you all for personally signing the football.
It has been a great pleasure to support your retail efforts in TX. You guys are a team with a big and tremendous vision. 
What is more, you have turned that vision into a clear mission to make the TX market the leading retail market for EES.

You can count on my total support.				

Many thanks,
Gloria
