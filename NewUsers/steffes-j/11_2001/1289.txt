Can we move it to 3pm??

 

Sure.  I am pretty wide open tomorrow.  Why not try 2pm tomorrow?

Hi Jim,

This is Mike Gelin, formerly of URM now with ETS under Eric Gadd and Stephen Dowd, we met on the plane on the way to D.C.  I was recruiting at Howard and you were going to listen in on that Supreme Court case.  Just wanted to drop a line to you and see how you were doing.  Maybe if you have time we can sit and chat while having some coffee downstairs.  

Mike,
