I would recommend that either Steve or myself call Bittenbender to recommend Kirk House - we met with him on the RTO discussions.

We should do it..you all figure out who is best person is. Thanks.

 

I received a call from Dan Clearfield this morn.  Nora Mead-Brownell has asked for his assistance in getting marketers to call the governor's office in support of Kirk House who is a former aide and is seeking the position of Small Business Advocate.  Mr. House is a supporter of competition and would be helpful in that position.  Apparently, the electric companies are opposing him. I would recommend that we make the call and I would be happy to do so, however, there are others who may have better contacts than I do (such as Sue in her work with the Governors),  Please advise.

Here is the name and number of the person in the Gov's office that deals with utility issues:  Fritz Bittenbender,783-2896.  The appointment is made by the Gov. (Schweiker).  He has two top aides:  Mark Campbell and Dave Sanko.  I can get you current phone #s for the latter people if you wish them.   Thanks for whatever help Enron can be.
