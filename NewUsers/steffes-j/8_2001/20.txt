Jim, I've already got you signed up.  Faxed it in today.  Ginger and I put you and Rick up at the Hyatt instead of the Monarch.  Ginger says Rick likes it better so I put you at the same place and will do the same for Christi.  OK?????

HAVE A GREAT EVENING

Linda




Sure




Yes, I just signed Jim up today.  Putting him up at the Park Hyatt where Rick is staying.  I know it costs a few dollars more but its nicer per Ginger.  Want the same?




Can you put this on my calendar and get me signed up?  Thanks




I'll be going.  You should go if you want to go.  It's a good opportunity to network.
