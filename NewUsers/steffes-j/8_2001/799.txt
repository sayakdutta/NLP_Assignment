I would recommend that you send Mike Day the language to clarify #3.

Jim

 

they are changing 1.
yes to 2.
3 i need help with.

 


A couple of points --

1.	The language in the relief indicates that we are trying to "determine the validity and amount of PX Credits owed to EES and EEMC".  Is this correct?  Isn't our primary goal in this complaint to (a) have the Utility return the net credit to our bills and (b) to allow for recoupment againts all non-generation related charges?

2.	Throughout the document the idea of "T&D charges" is used.  I assume that this is shorthand for all non-generation related charges?  We pay CTC and public purpose costs as well as T&D.

3.	Not sure if CPUC regulates the ESPs.  The filing makes this case in the first paragraph.

Thanks,

Jim
