Please see Seabron's request, attached.  Can we arrange for him to see how the PNW trading is done?

Just a thought. In prep. for the PNW hearing it would be very useful to
spend a day with the PNW traders in Portland (or from another firm in the
group, if that were more appropriate) just watching what they do. It would
help give me some better insight into the practical mechanics of the market,
which may prove important in the hearing. All of the various regions have
their own rules and procedures, including the WSCC. We should check with
Fergus I suppose to make sure its OK from the litigation front before
calling anyone in Portland.

I am sending you a proposed budget for the California hearing this p.m. as
well, to copy to Steffes. I assume that CRA will take the lead on the number
crunching, and that i will just follow the work plan items communicated
earlier to Steffes.
