Thanks for doing this.  

Jim



Jim, we are handling this for Lisa, plus the intervention in support for Enron Global Markets in the Calypso Pipeline proceeding.  However, I wanted to make sure you saw this as being within our job scope since EGM is a separate organization from ENA and EES.  I understand that Lisa used to use outside counsel to file her FERC pleadings, but I don't know why she changed.
 
Let me know if you want to discuss.  Thanks.
