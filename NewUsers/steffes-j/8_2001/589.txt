Please examine closely the attached note from the CalPX.  In the letter the=
y appear to want some guidance on how to allocate the refunds to buyers or =
they'll simply decide.  This is a quote ---

d.=09Allocation of refunds to demand (buyers).  As part of these proceeding=
 the method of allocation of refunds to buyers must be addressed.  CalPX pr=
oposes to use its share-fraction allocation method to determine how to spre=
ad the refunds among its participants if there are no specific Commission o=
rders on how to allocate the refunds.

Please let me know the implication and if the CAISO has a similar provision=
 in its tariff.
