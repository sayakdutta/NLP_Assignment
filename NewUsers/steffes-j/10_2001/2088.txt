I would probably not sign on directly, but would support the document with the additional thoughts --

1.	I don't understand a 6 month collaborative to work through SMD - this only extends the implementation.
2.	Need to push harder on doing away with the Reserve obligation.
3.	I would argue that the RTO need not run a Day Ahead market.  Also, why does a Day Ahead market provide "sufficient capacity committed in the right places for the next day in order to supply load reliably"?  California has a DA market and people simply did not participate.  The argument that a DA market replaces a Unit Committment process doesn't seem complete?
4.	The position and implications on CM and RT market going in at the same time needs to be made more clear - does this mean that Enron supports delaying all RTO "activity" (e.g., OASIS, single tariff, rates) until CM is complete?
5.	What is a "point-to-point" financial hedge?  Does this imply node-to-node?  Can we include some discussion of market "hubs"?  How could I obtain a hub-to-node hedge?  Also, what about the allocation or auction process for FTRs?  How should existing transmission arrangements be managed?
6.	Do we agree to Incremental pricing vs. Rolled-In?  Will this cause any heartburn for ETS?  What about the cost of expansion to meet the needs of incremental generation?  Should this be borne by the system or the generator?

My thought is that this is a big piece and Enron should probably file its own comments rather than sign on.  Sarah Novosel is working on Enron comments.

Attached is a paper from Comed.  It is substantially the same as the paper that they proposed about a month ago.  I will look over it today to determine whether or not we can support.  Appreciate any comments if you have a chance...

All:

After I sent out the draft late yesterday afternoon, I found out that FERC
had extended the deadline from November 5 to "as soon as reasonably
possible."  Obviously, we would like to provide everyone with sufficient
time to review the draft and get approvals.  We also have a saying in
Chicago - "Vote early and often" and at least with respect to the "vote
early" we think it is important to get comments in early.

Therefore we now suggest that instead of replying by the end of today as to
whether you can sign or not sign and what must be added or deleted for you
to join, we suggest responding by the end of Friday.  This will allow us to
circulate another draft and get comments in by the middle of next week and
have considerable influence on the process.

Thanks for your help under these changing circumstances.


Steve
