Thanks.  We're happy but Marianna is extremely sick - all day.

Enron could see $10 easily.  It's very bad!!!!!

Hadn't heard. That's great. Pass along my best to Marianna.

I had a feeling that the furthest northeast you would be moving is to
Kingwood.

When is the bloodletting going to stop?



We (Marianna and I) decided that with the new baby on the way - not sure if
you knew this - that now wasn't the time to head to DC.  Although with the
stock price and company in shambles, maybe it would be a more
"conservative" bet.

Hope you're doing well.

   Did you ever follow up with the DOE opportunity?
