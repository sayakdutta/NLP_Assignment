Jim --

How about breakfast on Wednesday this week?  I'm coming in tomorrow night and could do breakfast on Wed.

Jim:

Since I was just called in to the FERC last Friday to talk about RTO
benefits, I was thinking about what we were going to discuss a couple of
Thursdays ago.

Is market power and regional market analysis something that you all talk
about a lot?  I don't know very much about how you are organized, or how
something like this might fit with your agenda.

I'd be happy to talk with you at your convenience, just enough to learn
a little bit more about your thinking.  Perhaps a small group of
like-minded firms could use a piece like this to put in front of the
Commission together.  They like external parties to come in with
concrete proposals, especially if they are already thinking along the
same lines.
