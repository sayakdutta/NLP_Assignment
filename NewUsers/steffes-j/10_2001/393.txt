Sounds good.  Please make sure that Jeff Brown in EES is kept in the loop if this gets close to goal line.

FYI -
Susan Covino of New Power Company has successfully at formed a users group within PJM (PJM rules require at least five companies to form a users group that then has the authority to present changes to the PJM Members Committee for implementation but can also petition the Board directly if not satisfied with the Members Committee outcome) to address ICAP in PJM.  The group is called "ICAP Solution User Group" and the first meeting is scheduled for Oct 29.  I am planning on attending.  I assume the approach will be interim changes to ICAP with the ultimate goal of elimination.
