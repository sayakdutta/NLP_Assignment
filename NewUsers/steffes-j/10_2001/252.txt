Great.  Thanks.  

	  

	Probably want to talk with Jay Lewis and other product leads?  I'll get some names.

	Met with Jake Thomas (Origination) and Paul Choi (Mid-market).   It looks like we have concurrence on the ENA side of the house.   How do we run the traps on the EES side (i.e., Guy Devault, Jeff Ader, and whoever??)?  

	I'd like to go to Nevada next week (thursday,friday time frame) and start meeting with the Commission and OCA.
