Thanks Luiz.  As a follow-up, I'd like to be on record as saying that the PUCT wasted my time in flying to Austin (when plane travel is not secure, I'd add) and not even listening to my statements.  Why bring us if they had already made the decision?  Also, I don't know who is going to pay for more Market Readiness work in SPP unless AEP agrees to pay our costs.  The customers pay for their activities.

Jean, Pat:

Jim would like us to discuss next steps. 

In particular what should we do regarding Comission decision to delay retail competition - docket 24468? 


As far as Docket 24469 is concerned (SERC-Texas), please confirm the following:

	*	Comission decision to delay competition applies only to 24468
	*	There is an ongoing hearing on 24469 
	*	Today is the deadline for parties to intervene.
	*	However, Enron is not a party in this hearing; nor we filed any motion to intervene
	*	Comission has not requested Enron a specific Request for Testimony
	*	Arguments for delaying competition in SERC are similar to the ones for SPP
	*	Therefore, Comission may decide to delay retail competition as well
	*	Is there anything we can do about it?

Any other ideas?

The decision is for SPP Texas only - Docket 24468. 

You are right. SERC Texas has a different Docket number - 24469.

Luiz-  

Is this decision for all non-ERCOT Texas?  SPP Texas and SERC Texas?  I understand there are two docket numbers, and SERC Texas has not been decided yet?
