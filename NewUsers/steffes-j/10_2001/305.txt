Thanks.

 

Bev Hanson's firm is planning an event in Palm Springs with a number of legislators on November 4, 5, and 6.  The notion is to connect  legislator's directly with the firm's clients in an informal setting (with lots of golf and dinners).  We've been asked to participate.  

Bev notified me of this a short while ago, and has promised more details.  I told Bev we would be interested in participating.  

More details to follow ... .
