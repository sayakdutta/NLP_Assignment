Meant to include you all also, if you haven't updated this lately.  Thanks.

 

Hi folks.  Below is my very simple update (I have monovision lately).  Can you make sure and email yours to Bryan Gottfredson, Amr, and Jim (and cc the others on this too so we'll know what is happening?) thanks!

	This is the format we are currently using to keep track of all activities that fall under ENA management.  It may be helpful to keep track of your activities, as well as provide for an efficient vehicle for communication.

With everything else going on, it has been hard to develop the monthly report for ENA management.

I'd like to re-start this report and provide an update at the beginning of September.

While I am aware of some efforts, I am sure that I don't know about everything that is critical and on-going.  

I need get a list of projects that your teams are working on for Deal Support, Regulatory Risk, and Advocacy.  I am truly at a loss for current deals that Government Affairs is supporting and our expectation of closing dates.

For each project, I need lead Government Affairs person, financial impact (our your best guess), background and key issues, and strategies and next steps.

This list does not need to be exhaustive, but simply the major activities currently underway.

Thanks - I appreciate your help,

Jim
