Friday Night at 7:00 p.m. step out your door, stop your car, or step out of
your establishment and light a candle.   We will show the world that
Americans are strong and united together against terrorism.  Please pass

United

TERRORISM!

Thank you.

We need press to cover this - we need the world to see.
