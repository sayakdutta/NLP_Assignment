Not sure if there is much to do.  I was just sending this e-mail because I saw Alan working to find a copy as well as John Shelk's team - wanted to make sure we weren't duplicating efforts.

Jim:

What role do you perceive Alan and I should have on this issue?  It seems like the CFA report may help us on the native load issue but it doesn't add much to our effortsr re: one-RTO issue.

 


Alan & Paul --

See John Shelk's e-mail below.  Alan, you may want to coordinate.

Carin attended today's CFA press conference in which Mark Cooper released an electricity report.  Below is Carin's very helpful and well done summary of the report together with links to the CFA press release and the full report.  While we will sharply disagree with their comments on restructuring results in the states, we should be able to make use of their latest comments on the critical need to separate transmission from generation to avoid discrimination.  We should recruit them for our RTO legislative coalition.
