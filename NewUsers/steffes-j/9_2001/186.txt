Thanks.  Does Howard understand your deal and the going-forward issues (if any) that he needs to be aware of?  I want to make sure that he knows what is important and unimportant to this (and other load curtailment).

Jim - I discussed this with EES Legal.  Although we know about the NE RTO being created, we don't know the specific rules that will be implemented.  Therefore, our regulatory out language would be applicable.

Does change in law mean the implementation of the NE RTO?  That process is underway and whatever happens with its implementation we should already have a knowledge of?

Jim,

This is a 3 year deal, beginning Oct. 1.  Our standard terms and conditions, which MG has already executed, includes a "regulatory" out provision.  In addition, a change in law allows EES to terminate.

If ICAP or UCAP goes away, this would be a material change and EES would try to renegotiate the deal with MG or terminate if an acceptable deal cannot be reached.

Thanks - Jeff




I only have one question - the NYISO may be replaced by a NERTO as soon as this year in December.  What is the timeframe of the contract?  Also, the NYISO rules may change - what happens to our deal?  Do we have rights to restructure?  What happens if ICAP or UCAP goes away as an obligation?

Jim
