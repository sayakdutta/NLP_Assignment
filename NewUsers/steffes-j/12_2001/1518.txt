Also have we returned our physical PJM customers yet?

Jim -

The only thing I can think of is how it will affect some of the bundled deals still under review - if they have sites in PJM.

PJM sent a bill for the 2002 Annual Fee (for $5000).

Upon paying the fee, EPMI will be able to access E-Schedules.  

PJM is looking for payment on December 20, 2001 along with our November grid payment.

I assume that no Enron company will need the E-Schedule system after January 1 and therefore we will not be making this payment?

Please advise.

Jim
