Both interruptible and firm.

Thanks

 


Please advise.  Vickers had told me no "interruptible" in phase 1.  Please note long descriptions on certain firm gas products (constrained points) include an excuse of performance.  This may simply be a terminology issue.  
 

     This is contrary to what we had heard from Louise.  She is back
     tomorrow, can you kindly confirm.

     Reagrds,
