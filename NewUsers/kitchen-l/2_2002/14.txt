Can you come to my office and let's do it.






  If you would like us to manage this domain, we need to change which servers are considered authoritative for the domain. You will need to log-in to the register.com site to do this. I can either join you to walk you through it or I can send you step by step instructions. Just let me know which you prefer.

Thanks,

Jarod
