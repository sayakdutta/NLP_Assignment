     Hello all,

     Here is the latest draft of the day one GMCP for Energy Trading.  Any
     last minutes issues must be addressed tomorrow as we will be sending
     the policy to Marco and Walter for approval tomorrow at end of day.

     Also, please be aware that the EBK will be receiving this draft

     Thank you all for your help with this,

     Best,

     Wendy
