I thought we did establish Product Control on Friday  - let's just deal with Dave issues on priorities as we catch them between us.

Did you meet with Kim?

Thanks

Louise,

You may want to send a note to your commercial team to channel all new customer requests through Dave Forster and me.  I would like to be copied to make sure Dave has a clue as to what are real priorities.  Once we get up and running and the volume drops, I would be happy to coordinate this effort.
