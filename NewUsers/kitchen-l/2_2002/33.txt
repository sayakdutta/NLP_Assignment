Following this morning's meeting, we have agreed to have a fifteen minute conference call on a Thursday morning to give a quick update of issues.  Chris Calger will ensure a list of progress is circulated prior to the two calls.

For those of you 
Liz Taylor will redistribute the conference call numbers for Tuesday and Thursday.

Thanks

Louise
