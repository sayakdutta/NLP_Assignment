Ok on Sachs

I think that's a real problem with their money - how much each and how are the people?  Essentially - how material?

Bill may want to do a contract for Sachs at around 20/20. He's thinking about it and will let me know. Apparently RWE are chasing him.

NETCo ee's with nearly 5 years service at Enron
We have about 10 people who had they stayed at Enron estate for another 30 - 60 days would have vested in the Enron pension plan (cash-balance plan). We have tried to find some way to make something work here, but as it stands it looks like the are going to have to transfer on 8th of Feb and forfeit whatever was in this plan (roughly 5% of base salary per year and it is a 5 year service vesting arrangement). You may hear some noise.
