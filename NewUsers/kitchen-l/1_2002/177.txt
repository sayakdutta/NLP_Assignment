What decision was made?  I have no idea.

 

Louise,
I obviously don't agree on the decision that was made.  The decision to make me a director in the new company should be based upon my abilities as a marketer and the specific role that you want me to undertake for UBS.  Needless to say, I am disappointed but signed the document as the deadline approached quickly.
