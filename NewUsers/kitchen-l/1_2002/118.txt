Please could you set up the meetings (apart from the Thursday one which UBS already has arranged.  Contact Dave Forster and co-ordinate with him.  I couldn't forward you the email I sent but it was just to the 8 commercial MDs in UBSWEnergy.

Can you sende the attachment to all of the people (ex Enron only) on the lists (see in attachment) and copy to Par Odonnell and Mark Bridges - Dave Forster has their emails.

Thanks

Louise
