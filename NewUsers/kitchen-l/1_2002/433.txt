Pat - please pass to the appropriate person - thanks


I thought it may be helpful to introduce Dave Forster, Dave is the Vice President in charge of the commercial/operational aspects of EnronOnline (that was!).  We do have a relaunch plan in place which highlights critical timings which need to be met over the next weeks.  I hope this will assist you.  The attached document is a high level outline of what needs to be done between ourselves and the buyer.  

Should UBS be the winning bidder, we are currently planning to use the website name "ubsenergy.com".  If you intend to give us one of your own doamine names please let us know. 

If you have any questions  on the timetable, please do not hesitate to contact Dave or myself, or on the form of the agreements Mark Taylor.
