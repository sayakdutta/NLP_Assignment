That's fine - I;m back in tomorrow

 

Greg W. wants us to use new phone numbers for the Help Desk, etc.

Unless I hear otherwise from you tomorrow, I will proceed with preparing our documents with the new Help Desk number.

P.S. I realise I have been emailing you a lot. Please let me know if you would like me to cut down - I'm never sure whether I'm overcommunicating or not.
