Its an IT security issue - ask Jenny or Bob what they think the plans are - it would be better if we were near peole.

 

FYI

Kevin states that there is no near term conflict with estate and NETCO and is considering consolidating EWS estate on 3 & 4.  Please advise if you see issues related to  their plan.

Thanks.

Deborah and Janelle,

Mr. Fallon has asked for an estimated per person cost for moves:

1) within a building
2) between the Enron Centers

He also assured me that questions regarding conflicts between the estate and NETCO operating out of the same building had been addressed, thus there should be no problem with EWS consolidating on ECS 3&4 in the near term.

I also spoke with Rich DiMichele regarding the EBS move.  As we discussed, he obviously does not want to move EBS twice within ECN.  He is interested in bringing EBS over to ECS if wholesale will be here for any length of time.  Again, cost is obviously a concern, so the per person cost estimates you provide should facilitate this decision.  We can discuss this further at tomorrow's meeting.

Please provide me with copies of the marked up maps for ECS 3&4 as soon as possible so I can begin considering our options.  

Thanks,

Kevin
