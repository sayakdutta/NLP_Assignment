I had presumed it got transferred - Wes could you please sort.

There seems to be some confusion around who will own the intellectual property for the treasury workstation application.  It was Mary's and my understanding that the IP would remain with the estate and a license would be given to Netco to use the application.  Jay was under the impression that the IP was to be transferred to Netco.  Could someone please clarify.  

The estate (Mary Perkins) would like the IP to remain with the estate.  If this is a problem - please call Mary directly.

Thanks,
Beth
