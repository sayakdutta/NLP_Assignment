I'll just go with the black mat please.  

Do I get any discount for repeat ordering?

Please order and mail (fedex).

Thanks

Louise


 


Good morning Louise and thank you for the above  order.  I will outline some framing and shipping costs below as  requested.  I just wanted to confirm that the print you have ordered is not  exclusively a large Limited Edition print.  This image is also available in  the 11" and 18" sizes and is an edition of 2000.  The price of this image  remains the same throughout the edition and does not increase as per your other  large images i.e. Field of Rainbows and Three Sisters.
 
40" Mount and Mat (Black Matting) $99.30 or $90.27  GST exempt
40" Black Mat / Pewter Frame  $294.90  or  $268.09 ex GST 
40" Black Mat / Black Aluminium Frame (same as  Pewter frame)
(This includes High Quality Acrylic inserted  instead of glass)
 
Freight for either option $202.00
 
I hope this helps with your decision and I have  attached a sample image just help with your selection.
 
Look forward to your decision
 
Cheers
Fay
