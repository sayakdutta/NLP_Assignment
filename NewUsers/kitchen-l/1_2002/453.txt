I would like the Solitude, MT,USA photo.
Mounted but not framed.  
Black mount.
60 inches.
I would like in exactly the same format as the one you sent me last Christmas of Field of Rainbows.  If you still have that one on record.

Do I get a discount as a returning customer?

What is the delivered price (including Fedex).

Thanks
