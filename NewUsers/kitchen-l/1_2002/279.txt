Arnold picked this group up from EGM because he said they were profitable and would be a good source of income.  My recommendation is to drop them as we have no systems, lawyers, credit capacity to manage them.  Unless I hear otherwise they will be gone.




Can you respond to greg on this.




You definitely don't have room inder the TG headcount. Who are the people and what do they do?
