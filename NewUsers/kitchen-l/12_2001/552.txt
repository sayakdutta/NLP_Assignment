Not quite sure where we ended up on this lot but clearly some of the below are Enron Europe's, so we do not need to bother with them.





After conversations with Kal Shah and Greg Piper, here is where we stand on the trade marks and domain names.
 
A.  Ownership of the following to be transferred to NewCo:
 
1.  Putting the energy into e-comerce
2.  One stop energy shop
3.  Pricedesk
4.  Pricedesk.com
5.  Retaildesk
6.  Retaildesk.com
7.  Trading Innovation
 
Note that there are trademark applications pending for 2 and 7 above, and 3-6 above are registered by Enron Europe.  The Sellers will agree to convey whatever rights they have in marks 2-7 above to NewCo but cannot guarantee that NewCo will ultimately own the marks.
 
B.  EnronOnline:  Seller will grant NewCo a limited license to use the EnronOnline trade mark and logo for a period running 6 months from the date of closing solely for the purpose of marketing the new site as a platform for wholesale gas and power trading in North America.
 
C.  EnronOnline.com/net/org:  Seller will agree to redirect from EOL to NewCo for 60 days after NewCo site is up and running (with a link back to EOL at the NewCo site) and for 120 days thereafter will provide a link on the EOL site to the NewCo site.  
 
D.  Enbank:  Kal proposed that NewCo own this mark, but Greg would prefer that the Estate retain this mark.
 

 
Please let Roger know who should receive drafts of the License Agreements relating to B and C above.  
 
Please do not hesitate to call me at *36121 with any questions or comments.

Nancy -- As per our conversation this evening, I am attaching the e-mail I had sent to Leslie Hansen.  I will contact Leslie  in the morning and determine what marks/domain names Enron will allow for inclusion in the deal.  I agree that if the new company is going to have a different name, it should be sufficient if Enron kept the EnronOnline marks/domain names, but allowed their use for certain period of time to the new company.  I also acknowledge your concern that granting use of the marks may be more complicated if they are owned by Enron Europe given that it's a separate entity.  We will need to work out this issue depending on which entity owns the marks.  I will work with Leslie to research this tomorrow.
 
With regard to the "nice to have" trademarks in the second list below, I know that most of the domain names are owned by Enron Europe, not Enron Corp.  I will research to see which entity owns the trademarks on them.  If the trademarks are owned by Enron Europe as well, we may forgo including them in the deal for now.
 
Please hold off any offers for trademarks/domain names your deal papers until I call to confirm our final position.  I plan to speak to Leslie and Dave Forster (head of EnronOnline) in the morning.  Thanks.
