 

Life is pretty difficult at the moment.  It astonishes me that we (a trading company) were brought down by a rogue finance shop and some bad investments.

We are trying to sell the trading company (North America) in which Marcus and I work.  There are plenty of bidders in town but it is a pretty horrid time - working 10 weeks straight mostly through the nights and as you would expect no-one appreciates it!  I am really missing time with Scott.

Anyway hopefully better news coming.

Hope you are all well.

Take care all three of you

Louise (and Marcus and Scott)

 


Just wondered since we had not heard from you, whether you are  still there in view of all that has happened with Enron. How is Scott  doing?
 
Hope to hear from you sometime soon.
