Need to co-ordinate with Greg Piper and Brad Richter

 

Louise -

The following individuals will be returning to work tomorrow.

Zach Morning

Although Amelia is marked for termination in our global system, apparantly, she never left.  I will make sure that this gets updated.

A message has been left for Lydia - as soon as I hear back, I will let you know.
