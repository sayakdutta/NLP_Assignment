go slow on this - in terms of closing ref money out the door

 

Louise, I am moving forward on the TBG settlement.  I see that our meeting scheduled for tomorrow has been cancelled.  No problem, I will find you if this appears to be ready to close to give you an update.  Structure remains as we had discussed.
