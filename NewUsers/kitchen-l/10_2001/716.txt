I think we need to include groups with MPR where is was originated this year.

 

Generations Investments YTD balance is all MPR activity, so we didn't pick up b/c we're showing only originations- should we add? I don't see any originations tagged to him specifically.



 

I think we are missing - Generation investments and Mitch Robinson's group.

Q3 now over, you will each be receiving in the internal mail a copy of the origination numbers associated with each of your groups.  Please could you ensure the numbers are both;

(i) Correct, and 
(ii) Correctly allocated

Should employees have left the group or company please do not allocate the amount to another originator as this will distort the numbers, just leave the name of the employee and number in place although they have left.   These numbers will be used as a (obviously only one component) component of performance review.  As you know we also monitor the soft targets so please ensure these are correct too.   If you want to check your progress on soft targets - these are available from Faith.

Please send all alterations to Faith Killen or call her on 30352.

Thanks

Louise
