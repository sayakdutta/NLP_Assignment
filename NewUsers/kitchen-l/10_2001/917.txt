Jeff would like me or you to do this.  I'm grounded.  Let me know if you can do it.

John,

Louise would be great on this panel.  (Jon Corzine is a NJ senator, which in our country is pretty high in government.)  Also, I think the PG&E speaker is scheduled to be their CEO  (tentative).  It is a pretty high profile panel and important to Wharton we participate.  I need to know pretty quickly.
