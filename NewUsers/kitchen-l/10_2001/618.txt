Please give me the ENA individuals then as surely the whole point of ibuyit is forthem to do it themselves.

Louise,

I believe what you are seeing is names of Enron Networks employees who are placing orders on behalf of ENA. When this happens these employees are responsible for obtaining prior approval for the responsible party within the cost center their are ordering for. Additionally all IT hardware purchases must be reviewed and approved by a technical buyer once the cost center financial approval is obtained. Therefore, some of the individuals which you see listed in the approver 1 and approver 2 columns will not be ENA employees. 

Please advise if you have any additional questions.

Thanks
John
