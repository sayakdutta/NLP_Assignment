hi 

I don't have any - Jay Fitzgerald managed all of that for me and we closed the group down last year.

Sorry

Hi Louise,
 
it was good talking to you on my last day at Enron.  A couple of weeks have since past and I am now in Houston on a visitors visa.  Now I can focus on DealBench. I am currently spending 100% of my time searching  for funding of the venture. As you pointed out this solution would really be an  attractive one for both sides. 
 
The VC community is still under shock with the drop  in the NASDAQ and making contacts is best done through referrals. Do you know  anybody that is well connected in the VC community. I would be glad to meet with  that person and brief him on the venture and get going with the local Houston  venture firms.
 
Let me know if you have any other ideas that could  help the process.
 
Take care.
 
Tobias
