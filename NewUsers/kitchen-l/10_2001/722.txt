He's 5 months, 19lbs and not rolling over!  90th percentile for weight, 50th height, 50th head circumference.

doesn't sound like it will be long before you have another one!
 

Don't worry about the Baby not turning over,  It took Katiana a while to turn over also as she is off the charts as far as size and length, it also took her a while to walk but she is doing fine now. How old is he now and how much does he weigh?  

Nadine is doing fine, she is working part time and seems to be happier - I am loving being a Daddy :)

As far as EBS, OH yeah, lots of nervous people... there is still however some more cleaning up work to do so I think I'll be OK.



 

Fine  - how are you?  Baby not turning over yet because he's big!!!

Lots of people falling out of EBS aren't there.

 



Hi Louise,  Suarez was too shy to pass my message along when you called a few minutes ago.  Just wanted to say hi...

How is the baby doing?
