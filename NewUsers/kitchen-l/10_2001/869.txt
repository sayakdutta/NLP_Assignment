The 'Kitchen' is Hot
Fortune has ranked Louise Kitchen the 17th most powerful woman in corporate America. Louise, COO of Enron Americas, was recognized as the driving force behind EnronOnline, "begging, borrowing and stealing smart people" to get the commodity trading web site off the ground. In compiling the annual list of the 50 Most Powerful Women in Business, Fortune considered the size and importance of a woman's business in the global economy, her clout inside her company, the arc of her career - where she has been and where she is likely to go -- and the influence she has on mass culture and society.
Topping the list are No. 1, Carly Fiorina, chairman & CEO of Hewlett-Packard; No. 2, Meg Whitman, president and CEO of eBay; and No. 3, Oprah Winfrey, talk show host and chairman of Harpo Entertainment Group. The list appears in the Oct. 15 issue of Fortune.
