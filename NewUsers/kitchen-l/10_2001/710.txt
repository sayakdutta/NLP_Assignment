let me know what he said




I'm going to dinner w percopo. He's slid into town a bit quietly and has been hard to reach. I've left him a msg that if his schedule permits he should plan on swinging by the office to chat briefly with dave and a few of his guys if it can be arranged. Sounds like he's making a social call btwn business calls but I want to discuss what other lp's are telling him about lack of activity and remind him our 1 year roll option is coming due soon. Many other general market issues as well.
