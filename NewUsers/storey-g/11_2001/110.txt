Todd Esay called and still wants to book out some power deals. I refered him to Ed Sacks. BUT, I want to hold off on the book outs and tell him we'll do them if they agree to a credit ring (will bring in cash) on the gas side. Bill would need to call Sempra credit to verify our total exposure. Can we talk to them about this???? Please let Bill know.   geof
