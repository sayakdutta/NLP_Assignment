Patrick,

We would. I am just trying to put together a few counterparties. I will be emailing or calling you latter today.

Thanks,

Geof




Geoff,

I did not receive an e-mail from you yesterday.  I was just wondering if ENA
was still interested in sleeving out some physical positions with your other
counterparty.
