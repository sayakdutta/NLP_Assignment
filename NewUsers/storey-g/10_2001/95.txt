I dont know what any of this stuff is and this is the first time I've seen any $$s. 

I dont even see gas trading vision (maybe its the 'global trading vision'). 
Operational capacity, System Main, Fundamentals, Global Val, and Peoples all have other business sponsers. I cant image what 'IT Commer. Coord' is.
