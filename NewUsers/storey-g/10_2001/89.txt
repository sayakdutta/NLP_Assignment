Do i need to forget about this gas or is he still letting it breathe

 

Nothing done yet, but TC is coming in tomorrow for a special Friday workplace appearance to try to close something.  Actually, his tee-time is canceled due to weather

 

NBPL Ventura transfer point, IF vent + 0.0125 bid. sure

 

Do you still want that Vent (nov-oct) for Vent + .0125?

 

NBPL Harper transfer point, IF Vent + 0.05 or IF NGPL MidCont + .185 bid

Tony only offer so far is from Husky at Ventua plus .03 (nov-mar).  He is still looking for better offers
