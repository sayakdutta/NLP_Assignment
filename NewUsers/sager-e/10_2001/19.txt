I received a call this morning from Robert Minkoff.  His company is interested in buying EPMI's claim in the PCA bankruptcy.  I have not had any involvement in the PCA matter for quite some time, so I told him that I would pass along his name and number to someone who might know whether EPMI has any interest in selling its claim.  His telephone number is 201-968-0001.

Thanks.
