Hi Liz: 
These are the directions to Mike Larkin's house in Centerville where you will pick up the keys.  You will need to give him two checks..one for $500.00 and a deposit of $150.00. I will reimburse you the $500.00 and will get the deposit check back when I pick up the keys.   
A separate e-mail will follow wirh directions to the house.  I am asking Mike for a number to the house.  Call me when you get there and leave a number.  I'm not sure when I will head out of town tomorrow, but it will be by 2:30pm to avoid traffic.  Also send me you cell phone number.  My cell phone which I will keep on on my trip down is (202) 260-6132.  Also give me a call when you get into Dullus.  If you guys want to sleep here we can have a slumber party.  I have new sleeper couch and the kids could sleep on the floor.   
Chi

Attached are directions/info- there are 4 restaurants on mountain plus a market that has subs/pizza plus more in the valley and the house has everything plus a grillTo get to my house from Dulles go 28 south to 66 west one exit to 29 south go 3-4 miles to right on Bull Run Post Office Road ( big sign for Fairfax National Golf Club) go 2 miles to left on Sudley Rd and 3rd right on Fairfax National Way- We are 6316- ? mile on left  
Attached is the rental application. Our plans are taking shape for the trip to Wintergreen.  My sister will be flying into Dullus Thursday night and will head for Charlottesville.  Could she pick the keys up Thursday evening around 8:30 or 9pm and drop off a check at that time? She plans to stay in a hotel Thursday night, but will be the first to arrive at the house on Friday. 
Several questions -   Could you e-mail me directions to your house and to the house in Wintergreen?  I am planning on giving you two checks-  one for $500. for the three nights and one for $150.00 for the deposit. Is that correct? Does Wintergreen have a pool and or a clubhouse of any sort that serves lunch or dinner?  Is there a grill at the house. 
I look forward to hearing from you.
