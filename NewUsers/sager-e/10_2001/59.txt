Hi Moms,
If you have some time on Tuesday afternoon, we  could use some additional hands at the Brownie meeting.  One of our  projects will be to make a "sit-upon".  The girls will be lacing and  beading and we think some extra hands to help will be necessary.   Please reply if you can make it.  We probably will be  starting the project around 3:50 or 4pm.  
Sorry for the late notice and thanks in  advance,
Joy Lee
