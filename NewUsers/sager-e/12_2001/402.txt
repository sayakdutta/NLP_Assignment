I dropped off an original form at Lou's office.  According to Beverly,
who was not in the office yesterday afternoon, returned my call this
morning, could not find the fax I sent yesterday,and said an original is
not necessary, all of the forms will be sent by overnight mail to New
York leaving at four o'clock this afternoon.  I think we have all done
all that we could do and it is in Beverly's hands now.
