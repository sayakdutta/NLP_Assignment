By the end of the weekend I will finish an article on the EEI-NEM Master 
Agreement for publication in the Energy Law Journal.  I would appreciate it 
if you could take the time to review and comment on the draft.  I am 
especially interested in feedback on the description of the Into product.  
THanks.
