FYI  - I wanted you to know that, despite all appearances, we are working on 
finalizing Shari's move to Portland.  Shari is looking for a "relocation" 
package.  HR has been tied up in PRC and is now searching for a package that 
works.   HR has promised me a response today and then I can discuss w Mark H 
and then present to Shari. End of Feb is still the target date.  

Hope all well (despite the press).
