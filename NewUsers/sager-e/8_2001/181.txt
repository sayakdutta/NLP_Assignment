Elizabeth,

Greetings.  I hope you enjoyed your vacation.  

In the midst of all of the bad news from California, I thought I would pass on some good news.  You may recall that a while back I encouraged Gov't & Regulatory affairs to withdraw a complaint they had filed with FERC to suspend the ISO's underscheduling penalty.  I asked them to withdraw it because the CAISO Tariff said that the ISO would pay the penalty to Scheduling Coordinators that correctly scheduled load and did not incur the penalty (read Enron).  To make a long story short, Enron withdrew its complaint and FERC ordered that the ISO continue to impose the penalty for the time being.

We just received word today that the ISO is crediting us with approximately $30 million in underscheduling payments.  Although with the defaults we may not get full payment, perhaps we can use this as a bargaining chip/offset with California if we have to make refund payments to the ISO.

$30 million bucks!!!  I would have hoped for 10 times this amount, but it's still 30 million bucks.  Legal and Settlements should get origination credit for this.  Let me know when the ISO's check clears.---Steve

This is based on the settlement statements that the ISO sent me.
