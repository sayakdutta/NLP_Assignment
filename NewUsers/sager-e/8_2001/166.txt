Christian--For two previous cases (technical sweep & investigation) our CFO has tracked down the right people in Houston to get the invoices paid.  To avoid future delays, pls advise soonest regarding the status of the invoice for the Makad investigation.  Do we need to speak with someone else about this?  Do we need to be sending this invoices to a different office?  Thanks, Tom.
