As of today, I have not received paperwork to  register your daughter for Girl Scout STRIDERS, a track and field  event on December 1st.  If you want her to participate,  please deliver the event sign-up sheet and permission slip to Joy Lee by  Thursday, November 15th.  The troop's registration goes in Friday and girls  will not be able to register late.  
 
If you need a copy of the forms, please call Joy  713-660-8764.
 
If you are not participating this year, please  reply to let me know.
 
Thanks,  Joy Lee
