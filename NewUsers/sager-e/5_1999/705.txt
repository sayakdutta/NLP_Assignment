Hi Karen

Going to the legal conference.  Lucky me. I get to go only for Wed. night and 
2 hours on Thurs. then get to fly to DC for meetings w MH and others 
regarding contract standardization.  

Your analysis is historically correct but recently we have changed our 
policy. The new policy is meeting w limited sucess.

Let me know if you need any thing else.
