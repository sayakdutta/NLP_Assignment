I think Mary's idea is good - like with Calpine, we can just let them know that the draft is only for consideration.

I am overloaded on end of quarter deals and market disruption etc.  I suggest just sending out the current status of the form to begin negotiations, with the suggestion by comment that the parties may wish to develop a CSA type of attachment.  Then I can catch up to you on the flip side and Tanya will see that things are moving forward.  What do you think?  

 

Mary and Elizabeth:
Tanya is desperate for me to send something to Williams and I keep putting her off.  I have run out of delay tactics.  Any suggestions on what I should send out?
