To ensure that you are not embarrassed or surprised by anyone, this is where we are with Consumers.

A quick update on where we are:

We have asked for documents from Consumers and should be getting those in the next week or so.  We have also asked to take the depositions of the two Consumers' bookkeepers who allegedly made the "payment mistake."  Those should take place in the next three to four weeks.  To date, Consumers has not indicated a desire to conduct any discovery whatsoever.  Unbelievable.  Our counsel believes that Consumers doesn't really think this case will be arbitrated; but rather is hoping that as we approach an arbitration date, we will become much more willing to compromise.  As far as an arbitration date is concerned, nothing is set yet. We have agreed to approach the arbitrator (Professor White) after the depositions and check his calendar for available dates. I do think that, given Consumers cash-poor situation, they will attempt to get this matter resolved by year-end.  

Call me with questions.  Otherwise, I will keep you updated.
