I read this article and it looks ok to me - can you also read it (for legal issues and general correct information to the extent you know but not grammer, good writing...) and let me know if you see anything, Thanks.

Elizabeth- 

I am one of the editors for the Exchange Newsmagazine (the EWS external customer publication).  It is approval time and Legal needs to sign off on this article on Renewables.  The people quoted here have made their corrections. If you are not the appropriate person to read and approve this, please direct me to the right one.  I need this back by Friday, Sept. 28, if possible.

Thank you.
