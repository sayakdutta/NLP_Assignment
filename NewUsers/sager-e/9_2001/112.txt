Hi Vicki
Hope you had a good holiday.  When we spoke yesterday, I think I gave you a wrong number for Grant - His work number is 713 522 6300 (ask for Grant Cox).  He is expecting your call around 500 and will meet you in front of the Frost Bank Building on Norfolk (across from the post office).  Ella also has a note for you with this information.  Talk to you soon and thanks again.
