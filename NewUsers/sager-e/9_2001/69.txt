Elizabeth -

Here are the comments from me and Dede. I have given it to our Credit Dept.
and asked for comments but I doubt they will have much to add. Call me if
you have any questions with what we wrote.

With regard to the full-blown WSPP Collateral Annex, Dede and I think it
would be better to get the EEI one in a final form before converting it
over to fit into the WSPP. Otherwise, we could be revising the 2 documents
in parallel.

I am planning to get the short draft WSPP Collateral Annex over to you
today.

Thanks!
