Dear Elizabeth;

As per Mark Haedicke's request, please be kind enought to provide me with the short term PPA template that Enron uses in North America and Canada.  Mark asked me to compare the US/Canada and the Brazilian versions for clients who do not have a good credit history and, as consequence, will not enter into a Master Power Trading Agreement type of document.

Thanks and Regards,

Sami Arap
