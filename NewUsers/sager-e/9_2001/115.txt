Hi Ellen

Just checking to see when the federal estate tax return may be available for review.  Also checking to make sure you are also working on the Va  estate tax return. Thanks

Elizabeth-  I sent you a letter today.  To summarize, I asked Lou Alexander to prepare an evaluation of the accounts at Morgan Stanley.  I did not get the information I needed so I sent the securities off to be valued by a company that will turn it around in 5 days.  Once I have the stock info, I can complete the return- without the expenses unless I get them from you before then.  We can deduct on the return any expenses you paid on behalf of your mother from date of death to present including federal and state income taxes.  Send me a complete list as soon as possible.  We can extend the return and pay an estimated amount of tax with the extension.  I would prefer not to extend the return if possible because it is so close to being complete.
The VA attorney told me that the consents need to be notarized.  I have re-sent them to everyone requesting that signatures be notarized.  I don't know why he couldn't let me know that sooner.

Hi Ellen 
I will have some new expenses ie federal and state income taxes that have 
not been paid.  Expenses paid up to June 30th I paid from the estate, 
depleting cash so I assume we wouldn't list them.  Right?  I will provide 
you with things I can think of by the 27th.  What is happening in the VA 
probate?  When will I receive a draft of the return? I assume we can if 
necessary file an extension so long as we pay the estimated tax? is that 
right?

   mother's Estate and I notice that I don't have any expenses in my file.
