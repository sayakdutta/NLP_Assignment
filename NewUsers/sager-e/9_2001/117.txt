Here are the files I received.  Lisa will be working with Ben to file the proof of claim on Wed. I'm looking at this am. fyi - we are likely going to move the negative ctc claim back to EES and EEMC.  That decision is also being made today.  Thanks for your help - I'll let you know what date to calculate the receivable from after I hear final confirmation from Ben.
