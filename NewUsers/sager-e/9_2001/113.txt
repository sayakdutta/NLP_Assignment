Hi Ms. Post
My daughter, Ella Cox, is in your first grade class this year.  When you get a chance, I would appreciate the opportunity to meet with you about Ella.  This year is such an important step for her. 
Please give me a call when you get a chance to set up a time when we could meet for a short visit.  Thanks again.
