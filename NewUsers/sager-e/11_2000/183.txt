Was Ontario Power Generation the Canadian company you mentioned this morning 
that has alot of generation in Ontario and would likely be a major factor in 
determining the contract to be utilized in Canada?  Shari has had numerous 
conversations with a Greg Malcolm there and he has said that they are very 
interested in contracting with EPMI using EEI.  He and Shari have a call 
scheduled for Nov 20th.  

Just curious.
