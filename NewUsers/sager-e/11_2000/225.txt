Hi

We are so bad - we suddenly woke up and realized that Friday is December 
1st.  That means Saturday is the 2nd - Sam's birthday.  SO I'm writing 
invitations now.  Here it is: 

Can Eleanor and Alice join us on Saturday for a train party at the zoo?  
Around 10:00?  We would love to have you all come too, or not, if you prefer 
to  ..... shop.

PS Hope your holidays were, well, a holiday.
