Attached are the final PPA and GPSA documents.  No change was made to Section 
5.02(g) due to Kevin Presto's discussion with Roger.  Looks like we are going 
to try and get this accepted by AA as is.  I did make change in Section 
2.01(b) per Gail's suggestion.

Please give me a call when you get a chance letting me our timeline from 
receiving word back from AA.

Thanks again, - Mike
