Hi Paul


Hope all is well - I'm sorry I've been so out of touch.  My mom passed away this year and .....  I would love to talk to you this week but I'm on my way to Boston tonight and will not be back until Monday.  Lets talk then.

 

A close friend and former colleague of mine is applying for a job at
Enron.  Can I ask you a few questions today?
