Hi Andy

 I would not be able to make the meetings during the week of July 23rd but Carol could on the collateral annex. The WSPP is holding its meeting on August 10th so that also may not be the best time for people, but again Carol could likely attend the collateral annex meeting.  Hope all is well. And as always thanks for your help.
