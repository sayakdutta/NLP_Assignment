Hi 
Sorry I couldn't get back with you sooner -I was stuck in an EES meeting which lasted until 700 and then it followed me home for several hours only to be awoken at 1130 with news that "only I" had the authority to sign off on the deal and that it had to be done that night.  At 100, I said I'm done see you in the am.  In the darkness of early morning, we continued.  A temporary calm exists;  the tropical depression looms.  Call you when the rain ceases.
ps Boston was great, thanks
 

How was your trip to Boston?  It was a bit "hot" for Boston this weekend
(something like 82 degrees).  Anyway, hope you all had a good time.  I
think I need a martini (I have put 2 kittens to sleep in the past two days
and 2 others have died in my house in the past 3 days, yuck).  Any chance
you can slip out earlish tonight for a drink?  I have my 5 o'clock lawyer
call, but might be inclinded to skip it since I also have a 4 o'clock
lawyer call on bankruptcy issues.
