Hi Larry

Thanks for the email and the first draft.  I am attaching my proposed changes to the draft - I thought it might speed things up if you and I came up with a form we think works and then circulate it to our respective commercial folks for their approval.  Then if any of our respective commercial folks have any changes we will be that much closer.  Thanks again for all  your help.  Talk to you soon.

Good morning, Elizabeth.  Thanks for your call.  Attached below is my first
draft of the extension agreement.  I'm flying without instrumentation on
this, though, and your review and comments would be very helpful.  I'm tied
up for a good bit of this morning, but will call when I free up.  Larry
