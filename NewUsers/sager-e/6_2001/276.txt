Can you call Janice and let her know status. Thanks

 


I still have not received a package from you and am wondering if there's any problem that we need to address.  Please advise.  Thanks.
Regards, Janice

I got the package - I just found out that Mark is out so I'm trying to get 
Lance to sign.  Will email you when done. Thanks 
     

            Hi 
   Just wondering if you got the package I sent via FedEx last week and had 
   had a chance to get the letters signed. 
   I heard that you got more reinforcements recently (Travis and Kaye), and 
   I hope that things continue to go well there. 
   Regards, Janice
