Hi Larry

I haven't talked to Bill, but everyone else is OK with letter.  I thought I would go ahead and prepare execution copies using today's date for everything, get Bill to sign and then fax to you.  Assuming everything is OK with your folks, you could then sign and fax back.  If this is OK, let me know and include the fax number where I should send the letter agreement.  Thanks

All:  Attached below is Enron's attorney's revsion of my draft letter
agreement, which, in my view, is execution-ready.  This letter has not yet
been reviewed by EPMI, however, and there may be additional changes from
them.  Please let me know by cob today if you have concerns or suggested
revisions; I'd like to get Roy's signature early tomorrow--if Enron has no
additional comments or revisions to offer.  Thanks.  Larry
