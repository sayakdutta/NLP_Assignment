To All Subcommittee members:

    TMOS accepted the Enabling Agreement with one exception, they
changed the language in 5.2 and 5.3 to the pre-May 19th language.  It
became clear that even if TMOS sent this issue back to our subcommittee
and the subcommittee voted to keep the revised language, that TMOS might
still not accept it.  The issue, as Kenneth Ragsdale put it, was "who is
going to use the Exhibit "E."  To avoid postponing the Agreement going
to TAC, TMOS decided the issue in their meeting, which they clearly have
the right to do.

    I have  received a few more comments relating to scrivenor's errors
which I would like to clean up.  I will forward a revised final version
to all of you and TMOS by the end of next week.

    To all of you . . . job well done.  To Naim, who continued to
relentlessly push for the completion of this project, THANKS!

Margaret
