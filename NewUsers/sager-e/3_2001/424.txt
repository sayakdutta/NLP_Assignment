Kevin- I apologize for not getting back with you on this. I don't know if you 
know but I have resigned from Enron and have only a few days left. I am 
swamped with a lot of other work and I have asked my boss, Elizabeth Sager, 
to appoint a new atty to handle EOL matters (until Leslie Hansen returns).

She can be reached on x36349.

Thanks,

Please review the following attachment containing the proposed long 
description for the Physical Power Spread requested by Sean Crandall.  Sean 
has reviewed and approved the language for use on his product.  I will be 
setting this product up for testing once I receive word back from you.

Thank you.
Kevin
