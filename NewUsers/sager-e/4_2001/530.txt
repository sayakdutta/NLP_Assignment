I'm out this week giving a seminar - the head of the rival power form WSPP 
and me Miss EEI are giving presentations on why our documents are the best.  
Before that though we have tennis scheduled (he'll kill me but I do have the 
better form)  so it looks like we  will have to push it till the week of the 
23rd  Any day that week is good.


Way to go again on your sweet victory this weekend.
