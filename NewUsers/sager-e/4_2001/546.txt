Elizabeth: a few comments.  I'll call in the a.m.  I want to follow up on the 
receivables issue with respect to the post-bankruptcy/pre-termination period 
in the calculation.  Also, please note that there are still some brackets in 
the draft.  Again, I'm not sure how the blacklining will come out since it is 
always a struggle doing it remotely.  John
