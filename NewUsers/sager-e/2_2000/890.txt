Elizabeth, 
Could you please review Alabama Power's attached Terms and Conditions.  All 
bidders must clearly state exceptions to these T&Cs in their offer.  They say 
any exceptions will affect the value of the offer to Southern.

In addition, you should have received last week three summaries regarding 
interconnection structures with Southern at Caledonia.  That interconnection 
review you are doing and this review of the T&Cs are necessary for us to bid 
on the RFP on Feb. 24th.  So if you could get back to me on Feb. 18st, that 
will give me a few days to formulate a proposal.  Also, depending on what you 
think the feasibility of an interconnection is, I may not submit a proposal 
at all since it costs $10,000 to propose.

Thanks for your assistance, please do not hesitate to call me with your 
thoughts - Mike
