The June 1 issue of PUF contains an article about the Master Contract.  The 
reporter interviewed me and Richard McMahon, another EEI staffer, after our 
NY workshop.  The reporter promised that I would see the article before 
publication.  This never occured.  Had I had seen it I would have tried to 
correct several errors.   At the outset, I want to apologize for the 
mischarcterization of me and Richard McMahon as "architects" of the 
contract.   The true architects are the many industry representatives who 
devoted their time, energy, and company resources to participating in the 
year and a half drafting process.  EEI's role was only as a facilitator; 
hosting meetings; disseminating information, and sponsoring our series of 
contract workshops.
I intend to correct this error in a letter to the editor.
