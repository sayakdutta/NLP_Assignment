Hi Susan

How's things going?  I hope at least OK if not well.

Delete my rambling voice mail if you haven't heard it .

Hey about the Sat party, I'm thrilled.  We would, of course, love to come to 
your house (I think Gail told me that you generously offered to host your own 
birthday party) but we would also love to have you guys at our house as well 
(wouldn't you rather relax, drink and let the kids shuffle around without 
having to worry about the diner preparation, and worse yet, clean up - after 
all it is your party - mine's next).  Let me know what you think.
