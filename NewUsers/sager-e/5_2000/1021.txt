Hi

I talked to Grant and we are definitely considering coming up assuming we can 
make it work with your schedule.  The week you are in BI may work out great.  
We will get back in touch with you as soon as we check the details.  Thanks 
for the great offer and encouragement. I'm praying we can make it all work 
out.

Ella is a size 8.

Thanks again and I'll talk to you soon.
