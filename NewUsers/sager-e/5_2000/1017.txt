Michael

I received a call from your attorney a few days ago; she was  inquiring
about the status of the draft of the power sales agreement.  .  I misplaced
her number; therefore I did not get back to her.  Please apologize to her
for me.  We have not spent much time with your draft because we feel our
positions are so far apart that  NES's time was better spent working with
those suppliers that understood the program and were comfortable with the
program.  We have one contract signed and are negotiating with two other
suppliers.  Is there any point to sending ENRON a copy of the agreement NES
is will to sign or has ENRON decided it has very little interest in the
program as it is structured?
