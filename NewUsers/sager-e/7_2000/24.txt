Hi

Sorry to hear about being SICK - the only good there is re-experiencing the 
pure joy of being merely healthy.  After that nothing bad matters.  Would 
love to see you sometime - maybe next week lunch?  The Heights is still grand 
... too me.  Come by or call anytime.  Address  822 Columbia (on Columbia 
between 8th and 9th) Phne 713 8644023.

See ya
Elizabeth
