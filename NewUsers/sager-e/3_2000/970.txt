All:

I wanted to give you a heads-up that we have been shortlisted to negotiate 
with New Hampshire Electric Coop (NHEC) on supplying their load requirements 
from Sep-00 through May-01.   Attached is a table that sets forth the monthly 
quantities and our indicative pricing (will be refreshing pricing based on 
updated forwards).  They have decided not to go with the purchase for Jul-Aug 
at this time.  They seem to have gotten their act a little better together 
this time around with pre-approvals internally, but any deal they do would 
still need to be approved by the NHPUC.

Here's the scoop on timeline:

They will send to us a draft contract this Friday for review/comment.  We 
need to have our comments back to them by Weds Apr 5th.  Elizabeth, does this 
fit your schedule OK?
They plan to hold negotiations with us and other parties via phone on Monday 
Apr 10th, and hope to close  a deal that same day.  Again, this deal would be 
subject to NHPUC approval, so we need to get a feel for the risk of NHPUC 
disapproval.
Tracy - as you know, they are not so attractive from a credit standpoint.   
Is letter of credit sufficient in their case?  Can we talk about what we need 
to put in place for the transaction.

I will be in Houston on Weds-Fri of this week (Elizabeth and Tracy -- I'll be 
sure to swing by and introduce myself).  Thanks much and I'll forward the 
contract when I get it.

Regards,
John
