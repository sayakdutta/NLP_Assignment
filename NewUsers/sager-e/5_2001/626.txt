I think this message was sent in response to the message you tried to send 
from my computer ( not the old message) ... so I don't think the IT people 
got the message that you tried to send today.

Thanks

Thanks.  Hopefully the request I sent in from your computer will work.  I'll 
give them a call to let them know that you tried to send in your approval and 
the address was correct on the e-mail but you had the delivery failure.
