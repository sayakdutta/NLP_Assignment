Ms. Sager,

I placed the order for Genia FitzGerald's printer yesterday and I received an 
e-mail from the purchasing department stating that since you approve the 
expenditures that you will need to forward an e-mail to Enron IT Purchasing 


Attached below is a copy of their e-mail for your information that might 
assist you.


Thanks,
