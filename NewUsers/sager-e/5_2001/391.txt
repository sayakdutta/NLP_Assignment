Elizabeth:  No sign of the document yet.  Are you sending a siignature-ready
copy on Enron letterhead, or should I simply print off a copy, perhaps
re-addressed from Roy to Mike, and send that to you or to someone else at
Enron?  For the life of me, I can't recall what arrangementswe made
yesterday (I'm getting so much older, it seems, and so rapidly!).  Thanks.
Larry






In accordance with my voice message, attached is the Standstill Agreement,
which by copy of this letter I am asking Christian  Yoder, one of Enron's
lawyers in Portland, to have executed by Tim Belden and then faxed to you
at 415 973 5520 (fax) 415 973 3817 (telephone) .  If all is in order,
please have the agreement signed by PG&E and returned to me at fax number
713 646 3490.  If there are any problems, please call me at 713 853 6349.
Thanks for all you assistance in getting this finalized.
