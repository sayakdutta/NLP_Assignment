Elizabeth,

Following my e-mail of last week sending you a version of a new Dutch law 
governed pro forma Physical Power Master, I have since made some minor 
changes to that version to deal with typos, etc.  I now attach the final 
Dutch law version below, plus an English law version of that document.

Kind regards

Mark
