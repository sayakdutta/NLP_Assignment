FYI 

Here is a confirmation I prepared (very quickly) for use with Entergy (that 
weird customer who will only use WSPP) when we need to do a firm deal under 
the WSPP.

Attached is a revised Confirmation Agreement for the 4th Quarter Entergy 
transaction.  Rogers, I am coming to the floor to confirm withyou the 
Contract Price provision, and that prescheduling would occur on the prior 
businessday.
