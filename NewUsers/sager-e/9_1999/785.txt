To all:  I just talked to Kevin and we will use Enron-SE Corp. for this and 
not set up Enron-MW Corp. (Elizabeth,  we don't see a need to have a separate 
company, since all the confidentiality Ks, etc. are under Enron-SE Corp., but 
let me know if you disagree.  Thanks!)


   
	Enron North America Corp.
	
		


As we initiate the process to certify the Wheatland and Wilton Center plants 
as control areas in ECAR and MAIN, respectively, it is necessary to create a 
special purpose corporation.  As you may recall, we formed Enron-SE Corp. as 
the control area company for the Southeast peakers, and EPMI entered into an 
agreement with Enron-SE Corp. for control area services.

I would like to create a new company named Enron-MW Corp.  Enron-MW Corp. 
would be the entity where the ECAR and MAIN control areas would reside.  
Please proceed immediately to create this new corporation.

Felicia,
In addition to ordering letterhead for Enron-SE Corp., please also order 
corporate letterhead for Enron-MW Corp.
