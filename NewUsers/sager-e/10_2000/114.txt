Hi

Thanks for the feedback - you never know how things are rec'd when you 
standing for 90 minutes in front of a crowd of credit numbers guys, in a dark 
room with slides that are barely legible, taking about a contract that only a 
lawyer could love ... OK tolerate.  I'll send you the presentation by mail.  
Hopefully I didn't get too carried away.


Looking forward to seeing you Friday.
