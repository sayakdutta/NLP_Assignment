As you had requested, I am forwarding the newest turn of the Wind PPA.  
Attached immediately below is Mike Curry's draft of the grid showing the 
trades  which generated and should be reflected in this turn.  I will also 
forward you the revised draft Green Premium Sharing Agreement  when it comes 
in.  Thanks, David

Attached are clean and blacklined drafts of the revised PPA for Indian Mesa 
II.? I apologize for not being able to distribute this in the "track changes" 
format, but because of numerous internal drafts, the track changes document 
was simply too confusing with internal comments showing as deletions.? As a 
result, you will not be able to go into the blacklined version and 
accept/reject changes, nor make additional changes to such document without 
such changes being re-inserted into the "clean" version.? 

If you have any problems opening the attachments, please contact me at 
213-892-4337.
