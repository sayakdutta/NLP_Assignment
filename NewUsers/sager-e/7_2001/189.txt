Hi Andy 
Attached are drafts of language relating to prior transactions and market disruption.  Hope all is well and I'm looking forward to seeing you next week.

Dear Committee Members:

For those of you who volunteered to work on optional contract provisions, please circulate in advance of our 8/8 drafting committee meeting the provision(s) you are sponsoring.  These are the assignments from our meeting last September:

Incorporating Prior Transactions:  Liz
Market Disruption:  Liz
Unilateral Contract: Marty Jo (inherited from Buddy)
New Taxes:  Fritz
Regulatory Out:  Randy/John
Arbitration:  Patty
Electronic Tranasactions:  Babak
Additional Products:  Dede, Liz (?)

Thanks.  Details on dinner the night of the 7th remain to be firmed up.  I made a reservation at a new trendy place downtown called Zula, but have been told that Damian's is a better choice.  Any thoughts from you Houstonians?
