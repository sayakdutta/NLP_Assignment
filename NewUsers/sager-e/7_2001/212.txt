Hi Tracy

Give me or Harlan (713 345 2679) a call about this - I'll be here until 300

 

Elizabeth,

Have you had an opportunity to review Christian's email below and discuss the concept/concerns with Mark H.?

Please advise.

Regards,
Tracy

Elizabeth and Tracy, 

Here are a draft risk memo for this transaction and a set of confirms.  David Mitchell is going to fax a sentence to include in the confirms to deal with the bankruptcy void risk, to me.  I am asking you,  David, by this message, to kindly send the sentence to Elizabeth by e'mail. 

The commercial terms of each trade still need to be put into the confirms.  

Elizabeth thanks very much for helping to get this finished.   ----cgy
