Attached are copies of the PG&E Standstill Agreement (for reference) and the last extension that we did for the month of July (standstill expires on July 20).

I will be out of the office starting today and will not return until July 30. After we have finalized the terms of the extension with PG&E,  these are the forms that will need to be revised.  Lisa, if for any reason you need any help on this, please feel free to ask Carol for assistance.  She is out today but will be in Friday and Monday.  Thanks.
