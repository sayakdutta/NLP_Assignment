Hi Martin

Received your email but I don't have any particular knowledge in this area.  I would assume but without any knowledge that an English judgment would be enforceable in the US ( I would assume that we give English law  guarantees all the time for ISDA and other trading contracts which would have to be enforced against Enron in the US)  Maybe Justin Boyd in London or Clement Abrams (Enron corp attorney who works on guarantees ) would be able to help.  Good luck.

A trading counterparty of the Oslo office has rejected receiving an Enron Corp. Guaranty governed by English law and subjected to English jurisdiction on the basis that  judgments rendered by an English court may not be directly or safely enforceable in the U.S. (nor is New York or Texan law/jurisdiction an option in this case).  Perhaps you or your group could give me a quick guidance on the position of U.S. law as to the enforceability of English and foreign (civil law) judgments.  Additionally, I wonder if you've seen an arbitration clause in any Corp. Guaranty or can advise whether such an approach to dispute resolution would be acceptable to Corp. (since it is to this c/p).  Many thanks.

Martin
