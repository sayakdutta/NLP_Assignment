Enron Executives Blamed For Missing Employee Donut Fund
HOUSTON- The Enron Corp. scandal widened Monday, when The Houston
Chronicle reported that top company executives stole nearly $10 from the
employee donut fund sometime between June and August of last year.
"There should be at least $9.25 in the coffee can next to the filters,"
said Laurie Baker, a recently laid-off Enron employee. "I personally put
$2.50 into that fund, and now it's gone." Enron CEO Kenneth Lay is
already under grand-jury subpoena regarding $45 in Chinese-food-delivery
allocations that mysteriously vanished on Nov. 17, 2001.
