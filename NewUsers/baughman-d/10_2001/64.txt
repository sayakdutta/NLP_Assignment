Awesome!

 

Yes, I believe we will.  It is a $1000 penalty -- ridiculous.  We will oppose the concept of a penalty in general, as well as the amount, which seems very arbitrary.  We are also requesting, in a separate proceeding, a moratorium on tariff filings by MISO until the Midwest RTO process has progressed sufficiently to allow meaningful consideration of the tariff.
I am not sure who is doing the writing but we'll run a draft by you.  

 

I hope that we are planning to contest this proposed amendment.

On October 15, 2001, the Midwest ISO filed an amendment to 
Section 17.5 of its Open Access Transmission Tariff to charge 
a fee for non-confirmed transmission service requests for 
transmission service greater than one week. Midwest ISO 
has requested an effective date December 15, 2001.
Interventions and protests are due November 5.

Let me know if you need further information.
