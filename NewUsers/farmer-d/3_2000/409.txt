Also... What is the Enron dress code?  Do my clothes have to match?   I don't 
think I've really ever had a professional image.  Do I have to shave?  I 
don't think I've ever been anywhere on time.  This whole meeting thing is 
going to be difficult for me.  Just thought you needed to know.

Do I need to bring a pen and paper?  Is that considered "professional"?  I 
think it would be more impressive if you were taking my notes.  Let me know 
what you think.
