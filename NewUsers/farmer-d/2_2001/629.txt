I don't know.  Check with Settlements to see if they are billing us for Dec 
and Jan.

Daren,

Do you know if there should be a deal in place for Midcoast on this meter for 
January?  Currently, it only shows ENA.  I understand that a deal was added 
in December for Midcoast, but that deal was only good for Dec.

Thanks.

Mike
