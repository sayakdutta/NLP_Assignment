I sent an e-mail to anthony campos on the 19th asking him to change the counterparty.  I don't have the access to do that.  If he can change the name, then we won't have to create a new deal and re-path.  I just sent him another message today.

Daren,
Have you had a chance to look at this yet?

 

Daren,
Will you let me know when this change has been made?  I need to get some payments finaled by 3pm tomorrow.

 

Prior to 7/99  this was ENA not HPL, but there may be some issues on it as well for 3/99 to 6/99.  The deal ticket we used was 62717.  I will have to look further into the ENA activity because I know we still have some invoices that were paid under one company and we still have drafts under the other.

 

This ticket starts with 7/99 production.  How were all of the other months paid?

Daren, 

I am trying to get some payments out to Williams for old months 11/2000 and 1/2001 but global counterparty said this deal should have Black Marlin Pipeline Company Inc. instead of Black Marlin Pipeline Company effective 3/99.  The Black Marlin Pipeline Company was for an internal record (when it was an Enron entity).
