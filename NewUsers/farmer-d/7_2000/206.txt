Nicole, 
The correct price is 4.50.  I changed the deal ticket.

Daren,

Mary Gregg from LCRA said that Sitara #283939 should have been for 
$4.50/MMBtu.  Currently in Deal Manager-Sitara, it is at $2.50 and that is 
the price that I billed them at.  Please verify the price and let me know 
what you find out.

If you have any question, please, call me.

Thank you in advance for your help.
