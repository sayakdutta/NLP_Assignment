?All is well so far! Clay went back to work  today but hated to leave! But 
somebody has to make some money I guess! Mom has  been a great help with 
cooking and cleaning and letting us get caught up on some  sleep! Megan and 
dad are just sleeping now! I am surviving myself! We will send  more pictures 
as they come! So far we have been very lucky with her sleeing and  she is not 
very fussy either except when she has her spunge bath! Gotta go for  now! 
Love, Clay, Amy, & Megan
