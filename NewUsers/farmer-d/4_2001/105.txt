You can extend the deal for one day.

Cerrito Lastiendas - has meter flow on the 7th and the deal ended on the 6th.  Can we extend the deal for the 48 mmbtu's that flowed
or can I override the meter and add it to a day that flowed less than the nom? The third had 4861 and the nom was for 5000.
Thanks - Julie
