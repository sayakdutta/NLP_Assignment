Any deals that were confirmed with Equistar for the first of the month should be kept whole throughout the month.  On days where they didn't pull the nom, the buyback goes into effect.  Any shortages should be allocated to the buyback tickets.

Daren - I won't be here on Friday but Tom Acton will back me up. 
Megan Parker keeps asking me for an answer - have you had a chance to decide what to do?
Thanks - Julie

 

Have you heard from Daren yet?  Equistar won't pay the invoice until we bill it correctly.  Thanks for you help.  I know it's bid week.
