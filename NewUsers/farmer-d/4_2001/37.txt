Normally we inactivate old deals on the first Sunday of the month that lies closest to the 10th.
The job takes a long time and is run over the weekend. This Sunday (the 8th) we will inactivate
all the March deals. This is done to reduce the volume of deals in Sitara so that performance
(speed & stability) can be enhanced. The only application that this really affects is Position Manager.
Our IT department has asked if they can do this for all the April deals on May 6th next month.


Any concerns, please call the Sitara Hotline 853-7049

Thanks
GG
