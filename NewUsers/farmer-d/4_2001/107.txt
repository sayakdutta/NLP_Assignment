Ok, We should be paying Dow based on the index price.  But, it should be IF HSC - .07 instead of -.06.  Sales volumes should be allocated to deal 639612.

Can either of you answer Darren's question to me below? My sales deal is under ENA.
Thanks,

Tess, 

We probably should be invoicing selling to Dow at IF.  However, we should also have purchased the supply from Spinnaker (#144271 & 144264) at IF.  Did Spinnaker bill us at Index or Gas Daily?  What did we pay?  Let me know this and we can proceed from there.  Nelson Ferris did these deals.  I will talk to him after I hear from you.

Tess there is a deal out there for the blue dolphin S#745589.  And there are three deal out there for CSGT #639612, #639615, #745589.  The problem is that none of these deals have actuals.  It looks as though they have not been nom'd.

Daren are these deals real or what?  Why have they not been nom'd?  Could they be under another Dow company?

Tess, I'm leaving the office for a little bit today.  But I'll be back this afternoon.

Julie
