We did buy 5,000 from Beamont Meth.  The sale on 603107 should have been confirmed at 18,000 and the buy on deal 611178 should have been confirmed at 5,000 for the 9th.

Daren - did we have a purchase from Beaumont Methonal on 2/9?  I show a deal of 5.000 on deal 611178.  I confirmed a total of 13.000 (deal 603107) for that day.  Were we buying back 5.000 or was the deal reduced to 13000?

OK thanks! Will be there shortly. Also, Joanie received a call from Beaumont stating that there is a sale to HPL on 2/9 for 5,000 mmbtu. This was reflected on the supply  draft and Buddy Majorrwitz looked into this before he/we released invoice and said that there were no sales to HPL from Beaumont. Do you have any support or documentation re: any/ all 02/01 prod. sales to HPL ? If so, can I also get a copy of that support to fax to customer?

 

My location is 3507f.   




Ok, thanks! Can I get a copy of your support so that I can fax to customer this a.m.?  Please let me know your location.
Thanks,
Tess

 

I still handle meter 1428.  I checked my notes for 2/13.  There was an intraday change from 18.000 to 0.  When it was changed to 0, the meter had already flowed 3.811.  It is a valid volume.  If you have anymore questions, please let me know.

Aimee -
Per conversation with Rosa Brown and Thu (In Volumes Management, Beaumont Methanol is a swing deal, by which the gas sales allocations are handled by the scheduletr. Thu indicated that you were the scheduler for meter # 981428.

Do you still handle the sales allocations for  HPL meter # 981428? If so, can you confirm 02-01 sales (on HPL, Meter # 981428., Sales Deal # 603107), to Beaumont Methanol (which we've invoiced them ), vs. Chyral Hankins' e-mial to buddy Majorwitz below? The only date that is really in question is sales for flow date 02-13-01 (She reflects noms of 0 vs. the 3,811 mmbtu that we invoiced them).

Thanks,
Tess Ray

 

Tess, can you follow up on this and let me know if you have any questions.  Thank you!
