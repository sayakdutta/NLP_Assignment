Bob, 

I guess you need to make sure that this is the same well that they nominated during bidweek.  If it is, then we do need to change the price to GD.  If it is a new well behind the meter, you can either create a new deal ticket for this piece, or create a pricing tier on the old ticket.

Daren,

Please read this memo and the one dated 2/21/01 from Vance.  He told me all new production should be entered at IFHSC.  The deal in question is 634075.  Do you want it changed to Gas Daily?  Please advise.  Thanks.

Bob



Tom/Bob,

The following production is now on-line and a ticket should be created and entered into sitara based on the following:


Counterparty			Meter			Volumes		Price				Period		Global No.
HESCO Gathering Co., LLC	9876			85mmbtu/d		100% GD less $0.17		3/13 - 3/31	96057368

FYI, Susan will create and submit a committed reserves firm ticket for the remaining term of the deal beginning with the month of April.  Additionally, this is a Producer Svcs. deal and should be tracked in the IM Wellhead portfolio... attached to the gathering contract.


Thanks,
