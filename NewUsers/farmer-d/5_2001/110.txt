This should not be a problem.  They can make it up after the outage.

What would you like to do with the two day outage on May 8th and 9th. Meter 6722 will be shutdown for two days. 
Thanks - Julie

 

Three Rivers is scheduling PM on May 8 &9, this will involve shutting the
HPL point at Three Rivers for 2 full Gas days.  The nomination is 10.6 for
the month of May, we will makeup gas accordingly before maintance date or
after to balance for the month. Please let me know if you foresee any
problems with these dates, if no response back will go ahead and proceed
with scheduled work.
