The price should be IF Waha.  I have changed the price in Sitara.

I have a price discrepancy with one of Stacey's deals with Texaco Natural Gas for April 2001.  It is deal 695976 for 12,000/day.  We have it priced at WAHA gas daily + 0.005 and Texaco says it should be WAHA IF + 0.005.  Rick O'Bannion, the trader at Texaco, has confirmed their price.  Can you check this for me and let me know which is correct?

Thanks,
Megan
