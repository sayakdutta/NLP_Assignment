CR, 

Can you get with Duke and see if this gas should have been at Centana into 
Mobil instead of HPL?

Daren,
Deal 351653 is set up for 20,000mmbtu purchase from Duke at meter 981040 on 
HPL, but the actuals on CENT show a volume of 19,606 mmbtu at meter 77455 on 
8/2/00  with no deal set up.  Should this sale to Mobil have taken place on 
CENT  instead of HPL?
