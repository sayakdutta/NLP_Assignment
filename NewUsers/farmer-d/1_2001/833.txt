Darren:
I think Marta is referring to the supply deal 391119 on 9/6 for 10,545.  We 
do not have a price of GD + $0.04.  We have IF + $0.04.  Please check this 
price.  Also, they seem to be missing the overdelivery calculation in their 
spreadsheet.  Attached is the September 2000 spreadsheet.

Megan, 

Please see the message below.  The pricing on deal 391125 was incorrect;  
should be HSC GD-.04.  I corrected the deal ticket.

As follow-up documentation for the Intraday sale on 9/6/00, the following
states the pricing for the redeliveries:

8500 MMBTU from Fuels Cotton Valley priced per Paragraph 1a of the Contract
Price (per MMBTU) section in the Transaction Agreement.
10955 MMBTU at ETGS Carthage Hub Tailgate priced per Paragraph 1c of the
Contract Price (per MMBTU) section in the Transaction Agreement
10545 MMBTU at CIPCO/Mobile Beaumont  which is priced differently than
Paragraph 1b of the Contract Price (per MMBTU) section in the Transaction
Agreement.  The price for 10545 MMBTU for 9/6/00 will be HSC Daily plus
$.04/MMBTU.

Please confirm the above by replying to this E-Mail message.
