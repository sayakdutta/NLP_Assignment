 Managers, 

  I thought we would get started on sending out our Holiday cards the first 
week in November. 
  Do we contact the employeesindividually?  or will you provide a list of 
names and addresses? 

  Please advise. 

  Below, you will find the number of cards we have that were purchased for 
your group.  

  Thank you, 
  Heather Choate, x33278

My records show that you had ordered 325 holiday cards.  They have recently 
arrived and I wanted to verify that you still want your order.  If so, please 
provide me with a Co and RC#, along with room location.  Thanks.
