You may want to come to this meeting.  When we met with Bob Hall the other 
dayon OA, I mentioned that you and I should probably be included in the 
monthly meeting so that we would have an idea of any problems that were 
occurring each month.  If you have something else going on, don't worry about 
being there.  I'll relay the info to you.
