Daren,

This deal began in May, 2000.  I don't have a deal to book to from 12/99  - 
04/00.  Could you please retro the deal, or please tell me whom I need to 
speak to to clear this matter up?  Thank you for your time and patience

Mary,

BJD-ESS Corp is selling this gas to HPLC.  The deal ticket # is 258345.  This 
is a gathering contract that is attached to the wellhead portfolio.  Let me 
know if you need any other information.

Pat, 

This is the Texaco Fee CP, it flowed a total of 1,517 from Dec 99 to Apr 2 
2000.  There is a Strangers Agmt. set up to take allocations, however, this 
must be a wellhead related pt. that has declined.  How do I go about finding 
out who this belongs to?  I thought about ringing Texaco, but, wanted to 
check before I made any calls.

Stephanie, you are correct.  There's no deal set up for this meter from 12/99 
thru 4/2000.

Mary, please take a look at the meter for the months in question and let 
Stephanie or myself know whose gas this belongs to.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks

Anita, 
If you are no longer handling this meter, please pass this email on to the 
correct person.

For meter # 6563, I have meter statements showing that volume did flow for 
12/99 - 4/00 production on this meter.  I am not seeing this volume in volume 
management for these production months.  For 5/00 and 6/00 production, the 
volumes are there.  Is the reason because a deal number needs to be set up?
Please let me know.  

Thanks, Stephanie ( 3-6004 )
