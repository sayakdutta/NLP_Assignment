I have created deal 266962 for the volumes at mtr 6757.

What price is Duke reporting for the mtr 5192 volumes?  The only activity 
we've had out there is payback with Koch.

Aimee:

The Crow O'Connor, meter 6757 has its gas allocated to Strangers Gas for 
April and May 1999 and Duke has been calling Settlements asking for their 
money.  I will need to set up accounting arrangements for this meter for 
these months so please provide me the correct transportation contract and 
valid deal # for this transaction.

In addition, the Sarco Lateral, meter 5192 has its gas allocated to Strangers 
Gas for May and July 1999 and Duke has been calling Settlements asking for 
their money.  I will need to set up accounting arrangements for this meter 
for these months so please provide me the correct transportation contract and 
valid deal # for this transaction.

I would like to get this done ASAP since the customer is calling Settlements 
and we start close next week.

Thanks,

Fred
