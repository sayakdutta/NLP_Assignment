Do any of you use the messenging board system?  If so, please let me know how 
you like it.  If you don't use it, and/or aren't interested in using it, 
please let me know this as well.

Please ask your traders if they have signed on to the messenging board system 
and take a vote on how they like it.  I need to report to our setup team 
whether to or not it will be a permanent system or if they should take it 
away.

Thank You.
