Megan, 

We didn't operate HPL in a way where we matched markets with specific supplies.  The supply for these sales was the entire HPL system.  You can calculate the WACOG on HPL as an estimated cost for each day or month.  But I can't give you a specific supply cost or deal.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Darren:
I have a request from Jim Coffey that I hope you can help me with.  He wants to know the cost of supplying the gas to the GLO.  I can follow the ENA deals in path Manager, but I am having a hard time with the HPLC deals.  It looks like we were using gas from the 215 contract.  I can't tell, though, how the gas got to the 215.  Can you tell me where we got the supply for HPLC to sell and at what price?  I need to know for Jan through May.  The GLO deal numbers are below, if you need them.
