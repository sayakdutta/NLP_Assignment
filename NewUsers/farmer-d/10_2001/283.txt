I know the following:

1) Gulf Plains plant is in Nueces County.  
2) Marathon on Tejas is Galveston County.
Check with George to make sure no one in his group has called the other pipes.  I f they haven't, you can look into the old scheduling contact list and call El Paso and Dow.  For El Paso Offshore, we probably need points, but I believe most of their system is in Matagorda County.

I cant figure out what to make of this...

 



This is a follow up to the e-mail I sent earlier in th month.
Please be advised that we have discrepancies with the  State and County information for the meter No. (s) listed on the attached spreadsheet.
Will you please review this spreadsheet and provide the State and County information that you may have for the listed meters.

If you are not the scheduler for this pipe please forward this to the appropriate scheduler.


Please do not hesitate to contact me.



Thank you,
