Lincoln Police obviosly have a automatic link to the press.  Or the press is pinging the rap sheets daily.  This is not news.  Don't tell me no aggies ever have fights with their girlfriends or punch out a guy over a girl.  Its only news because of Local papers and police want it to be.  Call the College Station Police and ask if any football players have been involved in any "assaults".  They'd probably tell you its not your business.  This brown thing is funny because the new boyfriend kicked his ass.

The character of the NU football players is impressive.
