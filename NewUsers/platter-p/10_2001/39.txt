Bob,

What's up? Thanks for the recent e-mails.  Did you happen to get together with Lisa last weekend?
I am heading to Omaha the weekend of the 27th to see the folks and help them out with some things. I will most likely get together with Orhan sometime that weekend.
Let me know if by chance you will be around. Say hello to Traci.

be safe!
