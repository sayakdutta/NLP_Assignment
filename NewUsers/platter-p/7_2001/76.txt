I'm very interested in going.  Keep me posted.  I'm sure Hannah will have a blast.





A bunch of us went skiing last year in Tahoe and it was a blast!  I have a connection at Harrah's Reno for $20.00 per night and we hit three different ski areas.  I thought I'd send you an e-mail to see if you might want to go this year.  Anyway, Hannah comes Wednesday and we're getting ready.  Talk to you soon.

what is this? 

 











The executive committee met at the Lantern last night and it is 
confirmed that Ski Trip 2002 will take place January 30th - February 3rd 
at Lake Tahoe.  Venue will once again be Harrahs Reno due to the close 
proximity of the fine area amenities.  Uncle Johnny will be unable to 
make it due to having dinner guests in from Barrington.  However, the 
committee did approve of opening up the roster to additional 
participants.  Call me for details.
