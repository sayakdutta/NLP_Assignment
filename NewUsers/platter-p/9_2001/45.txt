Good Afternoon,

Here are the dates we are proposing for the FSP go-live.  This go-live will allow Trading & Scheduling to retire CAPS and the FSP data will be pushed to the CAPS historical tables so that Volume Management can continue their business processes.

Please let me know if this schedule looks ok.  We want to start booking flights next week.

Thanks,  David Poston
