Yeah, I remember everything in London being VERY expensive!!!  But I had a great time there, I'm ready to go back!  I wanted to take Rayfael there this summer, but I doubt that will happen now.

It's starting to get pretty hot....hitting 90 now.  YUK.  I wish I'd started running sooner while it was cooler....I'm trying to get back to 140, and I'm 8 1/2 lbs from my goal.  I'm going to have to get buff now that I'm on the market again - and partially to make Rayfael think twice!!!  heheh

Oops...I started typing this email two hours ago and got too busy to finish...I'll send this now and write more later...
