Good luck with the grass!  I can't even get my little yard covered.  Yeah, I'm open to going out with new people.  Just not really pursuing it just yet.  Depends on how long before I really feel the need :).  Actually, I'm more interested in just making some new friends right now.  I've decided I need a few gay friends to hang out with.  That will get me out meeting more people for other stuff too.

Yeah, mom and dad got back over the weekend.  They had a good time, sounds like they did nothing but shop!  She's been going to MD Anderson for a while now.  In fact they did bloodwork yesterday and she goes in to see the doctor today.  Anyway, that's the scoop from this side of the Atlantic....

Yeah, I think they will finish with the big bulldozer today, then they come
with the little one for the delicate areas...like right in front of my
french windows!!!  It's looking really nice, just need an acrea of grass
now!

sorry that things have not improved with rayfael...have you considered
getting out and seeing other folks.  I know you don't want too but it would
be good for you and you never know what a little jealousy can do...but I
don't mean Vincent.

We are having just beautiful weather!  How is it there?  Are your parents
back yet?  when is your mom going to MD Anderson?
