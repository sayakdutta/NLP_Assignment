I dunno what's going on there...the board gave approval to pull out of the deal, but I think that was just a threat.  I think we must be staying in the deal.  But our stock price is not so great right now.  There was an ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE article about Enron in Bloomberg Markets magazine.  It basically said we were a house of cards and lied about all our earnings expectations from new businesses.  It was very unflattering.  That came out yesterday, I think.  If I could find it in an electronic format, I'd send it to you, but I only have it on paper....

Enjoy your sun!  It's been pretty rainy and nasty here the last few days, but that's good for the yard.  Don't forget that my birthday is Friday!  I need a present from you!!!  hehehe
