I put this together to sort of summarize our activity to date on New England points.  As you can see, the volumes are moving up pretty steadily and we're at least getting a presence up there - with no assets, virtually no transport.  At the same time, we've taken pretty minimal risk.  Also of note, we are getting alot more calls for multiple month pricing on these points as well.

Please see attached spreadsheet....
