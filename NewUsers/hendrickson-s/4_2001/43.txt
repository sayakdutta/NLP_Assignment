We SOLD flex CNG Flex deals to El Paso (opposite of this month) for May.  The sitara deals are as follows:

737642 - ENA buys 5,000/d baseload from El Paso at CNG SP for Index flat.
737647 - ENA sells 0-15,500/d to El Paso at CNG SP for Index plus $0.055.  El Paso must take 155,000 for the month.

737645 - ENA buys 5,000/d baseload from El Paso at CNG SP for Index flat.
737655 - ENA sells 0-15,500/d to El Paso at CNG SP for Index plus $0.065.  El Paso must take 155,000 for the month.


On deals # 737647 and 737655 (we sell to El Paso), the volume is in as a baseload of 5,000/d but the expected volume is zero on May 1-21, and 15,500 on May 22-31.  CHRIS - make sure we keep up with this on the morning sheet and that the volume is zeroed out in the system until they actually call on it.  They will have to call us by 9:30 am to take the gas on any day.
