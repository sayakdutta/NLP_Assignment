Krishna,

Please see attached data on the pages named "MO IND DATA" and "Basis Forwards". I am interested in understanding the math associated with valuing calls and puts on the spread between the index points. Also, do you have an option pricing model that I could have? My office number is 5-4173.

Thanks,

Paul

P.S. Do you recall the work that you did for Kim Watson in the past?
