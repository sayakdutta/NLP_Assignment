Shubh,

The only publication that I have been getting is World Gas Intelligence published by Energy Intelligence Group. I can FAX you my latest copy if you are interested. Also, they have a web site:  www.energyintel.com

Poten & Partners' main number in New York is 212 230-2000. Also, there is a sample issue of LNG in World Markets at www.poten.com. I spoke with Lizette Valentin (Poten) and she says the lowest cost way for you to get the publication is to be added on to Clay Harris's subscription for $500/year. Lizette's number is 212 230-2086. The website also has the form that you need to fill out to get added on to Clay's subscription. 

Call me and we can look at the website together.

I am also anxious to get some news regarding the lenders' meeting in Singapore.

Take Care,

Paul 

 

Paul,

I was wondering if you are getting some LNG industry reports/analysis e.g. "LNG in World Markets" published by Poten & Partners.  If yes, would it be convenient for you to arrange a copy of the same for DPC?

As I write this mail, the DPC lenders meet is still going on in Singapore.  All of us are anxiously waiting to know the outcome.

Regards,
Shubh
