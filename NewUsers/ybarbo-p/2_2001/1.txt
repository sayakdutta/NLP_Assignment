Jassem,

Attached is the latest update for the DPC project. A printed copy of the 
attached document with photos is being forwarded to you seperately. I will be 
responsible for sending you the monthly updates in the future. Also, I am 
planning a trip to the Middle East at the end of March and the beginning of 
April. I hope to meet with you at that time. If you have any questions, 
please feel free to call me at 713 345-5855.

Best Regards,

Paul
