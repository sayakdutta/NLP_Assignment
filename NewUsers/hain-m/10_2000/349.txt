This is getting rediculous.  Twenty four hours notice is simply not 
sufficient time to give us the notice required by the tariff.  Given the 
current barrage of data requests and confidentiality requests I hadn't even 
had time to read your E-mail when it was past time to respond.  Accordingly, 
Mike Day will be sending to FERC a request for confidential treatment.
