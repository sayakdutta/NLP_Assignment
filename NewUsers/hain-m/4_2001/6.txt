Hi kids!
?
Hope you all are well and enjoying  the?return of daylight!? I'm sending out 
a quick note to let you all  know about my regular solo gig.? Just a couple 
of weeks ago, I started  playing and singing every Monday night at the Empire 
Room at 4206 SE Hawthorne  Blvd.? The Empire Room is a wonderful wine and 
dessert bar.? It also  offers appetizers and a few dinner entrees which are 
on the lighter side.?  Above all it is a wonderful place to spend time with 
friends and family and now  listen to music in a smoke-free, kid friendly 
environment.? There is no  cover charge.??I start playing around?8:
30pm?and?play  for a couple of hours finishing up around?11pm. 
?
Hope to see you all there!
?
Take care,
?
