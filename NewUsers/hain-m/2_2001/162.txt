Although I haven't seen this yet, I agree, this sounds like something we want 
to support.  Alan would you unzip for me?

On Feb. 6, 2001, Mirant Delta, LLC and Mirant Potrero, LLC filed a complaint 
against the Cal ISO in Docket No. EL01-35-000, which has been attached.  In 
the complaint, Mirant alleges that the ISO is violating the Federal Power Act 
and prior FERC orders through (1) waiving the applicable credit requirements 
for the IOUs prior to FERC approval (particularly in light of the ISO's 
inability to pay suppliers for energy provided); (2) failing to pursue all 
available remedies against defaulting parties; and (3) seating a 
non-independent governance board.

The relief sought by Mirant is as follows:  (1) that it be required to sell 
wholesale power only on commercially reasonable terms that provide for 
adequate assurances of payment; (2) that FERC order the ISO not to change its 
rates unilaterally in violation of the Filed Rate Doctrine; and (3) that FERC 
require the ISO adhere to the specific provisions of its tariff and FERC 
orders.

Mirant has requested fast track processing for this complaint.  It appears 
that FERC is granting this request; FERC noticed the complaint on Feb. 8, and 
established Feb. 26 as the due date for interventions/protests and answers.
