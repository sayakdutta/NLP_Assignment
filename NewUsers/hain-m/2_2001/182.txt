Attached find a letter to Sierra Pacific about our transmission and 
interconnection requests.  Due to Nevada Power's dilatory tactics to date and 
the pendancy of financing for the project, Ed, Don, Stan, Jim G., and I agree 
that the letter takes the necessary tone and should ask Sierra to file with 
FERC the agreements (unexecuted) if Sierra doesn't give EPMI an executable 
contracts by 2/28/01.  If we are going to make this demand we need to send 
this letter ASAP.
