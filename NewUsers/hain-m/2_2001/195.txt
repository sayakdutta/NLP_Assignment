I am under the impression that we still need to file the attached protest to 
a 12/13/00 Cal PX FERC filing that would (in the PX's interpretation) allow 
them to confiscate our collateral in the Block Forward Market to satisfy the 
defaults of other participants in the PX markets.  Please let me know if we 
don't need to file this.  Please give me your comments on the draft ASAP.

I assume we still want to file this protest to preserve our rights.  Please 
give me your comments ASAP.  Thanks.  Ron
