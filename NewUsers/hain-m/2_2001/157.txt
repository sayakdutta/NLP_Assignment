We will need another letter sent.  If I get a E-mail notice from the PX I'll 
forward it to you.

It is my understanding that the CPUC has served a data request on the PX 
seeking market data dating back to 1998.  The parties were given until Friday 
to inform the PX whether they object to the PX turning the information over 
to the CPUC.

Please let me know if you would me to set up a conference to discuss a 
possible group response or do you think that this is something that should be 
dealt with on an individual basis?
