I'm sure Enron's stockholders would want Enron to join a filing to allow 
Enron to participate in discussions between the PX and the Chairman of FERC 
(and to oppose any ex parte communications) about whether the PX holds 
Enron's money.  I would be interested in going to the discussion too.





We have been asked to join in this filing. Any thoughts?
