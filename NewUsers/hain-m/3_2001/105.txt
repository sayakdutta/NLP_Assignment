Ron - Mary has asked that the document you reference be faxed to her in 
Houston (she is attending meetings there).  I will be out of the office 
Friday.

Would you please fax the document to her at:

281-364-6274.  This is the number for the Woodlands Resort.  The phone 
number, in case you need it, is 281-367-1100.

Thanks, Ron

Just a note to let you know that we are close to sending out our draft 
response to the PX's answer and hope to do so tomorrow morning.  We would 
like to hold a conference call on Monday afternoon at 3:00 (eastern) to 
discuss.  Our objective is to file on Tuesday, which should be sufficient 
since the complaint has not been scheduled for next week's meeting.

We will send the call-in information for Monday's conference call when we 
circulate the draft tomorrow.  Please let me know ASAP if you would prefer a 
different time on Monday for the call.

Also, let me know if I left off any of your colleagues or clients from this 
email list, or included anyone twice.  This list is limited to the nine 
parties that joined in our complaint.

Thanks.  Ron
