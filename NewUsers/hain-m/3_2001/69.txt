Effective April 6, 2001, I am resigning my position as Director of Federal 
Regulatory Affairs with Enron Corp.  It has been a pleasure working with 
you.  I will be working today and will be on vacation for the remainder of 
the time.  During my vacation, next week, I can be reached at home at (503) 
699-5864.  The next week, Lysa will know how to reach me.
