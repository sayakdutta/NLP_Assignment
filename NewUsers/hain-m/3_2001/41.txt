To Members of the RTO West Provisions and Requirements Content Group:

Hello!

As you may already know, at last Friday's meeting, the RRG agreed that
the RTO West process should refocus its efforts over the next few weeks
on, at a minimum, congestion management and pricing.  Just what that
means for the other content groups is unclear, although it is possible
that some will continue and others will be put on hold until critical
congestion management and pricing decisions are made.  The Coordinating
Team is preparing a recommendation and participants will be informed
about the changes to the work plan and schedule in the near future.

I think it is likely that the work of the Provisions and Requirements
Content Group will be put on hold for some time, and that the April
17-18 retreat will be rescheduled.  That said, you should wait until you
receive the final word on the schedule before you change your plans.

I will keep you posted.

Take care!  Kristi
