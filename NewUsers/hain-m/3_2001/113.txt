On Tuesday, Tucson filed a complaint against the Power Exchange and Governor 
Davis, arguing that the FERC should render null and void the unconditional 
transfer of SCE and PG&E's block forward contracts.  It argues that such a 
transfer requires prior FERC approval under Section 203 of the Federal Power 
Act and should be conditioned by FERC to protect the public interest.  It 
also argues that FERC should order the PX to enforce its tariff, by requiring 
the PX to immediately collect from PG&E and SCE all monies due for wholesale 
sales to date.
