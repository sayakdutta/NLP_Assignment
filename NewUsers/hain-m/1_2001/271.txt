You're very welcome for both.
BTW, I have meant to check in with you about a piece of work we're
considering doing.  I've mentioned to Tim and to Sue, but wanted to also get
your feedback.

BPA TBL has asked for my support on RTO-West.  Mostly I'll be supporting
them on drafting settlements algorithms and protocols for the policies
already determined there.  But they may ask me to do other things along the
way too.  I've already said I wouldn't want to advocate on their behalf on
any issues that do not align with what Carl I has been advocating.  Further,
I've restated my personal, and TCA's corporate, position of open markets and
said that I would not advocate for any position that goes against that.

Carl feels we'll come up with better solutions if I work with them than we
will if they use somebody less thoughtful.

Please let me know if you have any concerns at this point.  Otherwise I'll
simply raise any potential conflict issues with you as they arise in the
course of doing work.

Best wishes,
Ellen.




Thank you for the maple syrup.  Also, thank you for all of your great help
last year.
