I want verification from Tim, Chris Calger, and you that working on the RTO 
West tariff and generation interconnect agreement is consistent with my "new 
narrower role" as regulatory attorney for the West power desk and the 
apporpriate priority for use of my time.  Should I ask them now or should I 
wait until after we meet next week?
