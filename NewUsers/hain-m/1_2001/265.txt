Hello Everyone!

The proposed Stage 2 content groups and roster of participants from related
work groups in Stage 1 has been posted to the RTO West website at:

http://208.55.67.64/Doc/Stage2_ProposedRoster_Jan152001.PDF

Please reply to this email with any additions, corrections or new
information by January 26th since content groups will be getting underway
the first week of February. Verify the names of participants listed (names
will be removed if they are not confirmed as Stage 2 participants).

Also, please indicate all individuals who should receive information from a
particular content group as well as designate a lead representative(s). It
would be helpful to us if your response was coordinated within your
organization.

We look forward to hearing from you!
Regards, jw
