The ISO has sent us the attached letter saying that we are required to file 
with it (and the Electricity Oversight Board (EOB)) our reports of prices 
over the soft cap.  It cites to it's Amendment 33 filing as authority.  The 
ISO's proposed tariff did not include any such requirement, rather it asked 
the Commission to so order.  Although the FERC approved Amendment 33, the 
FERC's order on the filing makes no mention of such requirement.  I would 
like Dan or Ron to advise whether this allows us to avoid filing this 
information with the ISO and EOB. 

I will also be asking members of EPSA what they plan to do during the 
conference call tomorrow.

The ISO appears to have taken it upon itself to get above $250/MWh costs for 
the month of December pursuant to the Dec 8, 2000 emergency order.

Mary, Steve and I need to confirm that these data are in fact required to be 
reported by that Order.  (Mary, can you point me to our copy of that 
emergency order?)

Chris,  can you run a report for December 8-31 to see what accepted bids may 
be reportable?  During the breakpoint was $250, not $150.
