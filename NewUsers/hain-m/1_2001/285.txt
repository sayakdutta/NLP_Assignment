Shouldn't we protest this filing at FERC?  Otherwise we'll have to track on a 
day-to-day basis whether we should sell to the ISO.

This ISO amendment was issued on 1/4/01 but I am not sure if anything was  
circulated to folks on the Trading Desk. 

The amendment allows the ISO to relax creditworthiness requirements to the 
utilities on a day to day basis.  A copy of the transmittal letter is 
attached.

The ISO has been invoking its order this week.  See notice issued for 
tomorrow, below.

If you have questions regarding this amendment, please do not hesitate to 
call me.
