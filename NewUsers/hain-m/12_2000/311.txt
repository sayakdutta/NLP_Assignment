I'd like to set up a call for this afternoon to discuss the FERC's order, in 
general.  Also, in an hour or so I'll also be forwarding a proposed issue 
list on rehearing so we can talk about it.

I got your message after I sent you this update.  I sent a note to everyone I 
contacted, advising the call would not take place.
