Is there anything we can do to address circumstances where we are required to 
bid into the ISO pursuant to the DOE's Section 202(c) order - especially for 
the fixed price customers?

For your review:

Under this rider, service customers selling energy to EPMI at an indexed 
price would be required to reimburse EPMI for any FERC-ordered refunds or 
short payments due to a credit default at the PX/ISO.  Customers selling for 
a fixed price would not be subject to these prior adjustments because the 
customers have no expectation that EPMI will necessarily sell into 
California.
