I attach the form of refund letter you sent, redlined with suggested 
revisions. One matter I have not addressed:  The letter is not explicit as to 
how any reduced amount from a resale of power will be allocated between 
Enron's and the customer's share of the resale revenue; if the underlying 
agreement is not clear on this point, an appropriate additional sentence 
might be added.

Today I spoke with Mr. Fergus, who asked me to send him a copy of the letter 
for his review and comment before it went out.   I also spoke with Mr. 
Haedicke, who instructed me to send him or Mr. Sanders an information of copy 
of materials I send to Mr. Fergus.  I thus have addressed copies of the 
redline to each of these individuals.

I will be out of town Tuesday (back Wednesday).  However, I request that you 
confirm whether Mr. Fergus has any reservations about the form of the letter.
