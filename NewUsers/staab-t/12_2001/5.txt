I think Citation should be good now.  Try and re-draft and let me know.

I'm working on your other emails next.  I'll take them one at a time.

Amy will no longer be here so I will be the only one working on this.  

Talk to you soon.

 

Please add a rate to this path (see path list for all paths at bottom of screen print).  Thanks, Gloria
