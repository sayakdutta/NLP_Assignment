Okay mister....Team Chick hasn't been in the SuperBowl every year for no reason.

We have always stuck with our original team unless there were injuries so this trading thing is something we have to be sure about.  

I think we're in a pretty good position so far this year so don't rush us.

We'll let you know in the morning if we are interested or not.

And by the way - where's our $60?????





OK.  Since yall are so slow to think, here are a few ideas.  You have two
solid WR's in Moss and Owens.  I have two solid RBs in L. Smith and C.
Dillon.  

Or let's get creative.  I can solidify your Giant's RB situation with R.
Dayne and another second tier RB for one of the above.  

Let's think out of the box.  That dear in the head lights look is why yall
are in the position your in right now.




What's your idea?





I want a good receiver.  You need a RB.
