Robert,
I'm working on this right now.  What do you show as the storage schedule?

I have 2 different ones.  I know you changed it.  I just want to make sure we're both on the same schedule.  

I'll just make sure my volumes on storage match with the schedule and then I can send them all to you.
Thanks,

Theresa




Thersa,
Can you send me your revisions with the discounted price and commodity
charges applied to the planned storage injections today or tomorrow?  I
really need that ASAP to see if our numbers are getting any closer.  
I believe that the fuel calculations are being taken into account for the
planned storage injections for the whole path from CIG through WIC and into
Young Storage.  I was planning on calling you after I saw your revisions.


Thanks...Robert
