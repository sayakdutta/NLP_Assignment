Valerie,
I should have Greeley on Monday for August.  Robert Poole at Greeley is still reviewing all prior months to see where we have differences and what is causing it. 

I'll talk to you on Monday.

Hi Theresa,
Just wondering how Greeley is looking this month. How about those prior month issues???

Let me know when you're ready and I'll look at what's in the system.

Thanks!
