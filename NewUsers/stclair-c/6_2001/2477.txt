Ed:
Thanks for your help.  Since I am a lawyer, it would help to have someone on 
your legal staff on the call.  Let me know if that is possible.  Thanks.

At this point, I get with our Rene Dumstorf (Chief Credit Officer,

Ed:
I spoke with our credit people today.  We would like to arrange a call to
discuss our concerns about Section 5 of the Guaranty with me, our credit
people, your counsel and your credit person or someone that can make a
decision if we propose a change to the Guaranty.  Can you let me know who
these people are (and their phone numbers) so that we can arrange a call?
We understand fully your need for the Section 5 language, but we would like
to explore with your people whether your concerns can be addressed in a
different manner.  Thanks.
