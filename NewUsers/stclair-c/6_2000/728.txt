FYI.  I think that I can handle this as long as it does close by quarter end.

I understand that we want to put a second Raptor transaction in place before 
the end of the month. One major difference from Raptor 1 is that no stock 
from the UBS position will be involved. 

Anne, Will we be getting a fairness opinion on this deal? We also need to 
think about whether we'll need to get full board or executive committee 
approval.

Thanks!

Scott
