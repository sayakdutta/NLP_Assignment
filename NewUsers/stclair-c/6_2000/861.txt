Carol:

I will work on this from the power side, but we will need someone on the 
financial side as well.  I'd rather not meet with Claudio until Wednesday.

Mark and Leslie:
Claudio wants to talk to someone about this weather/power online product that 
he is working on.    Enclosed is info on it.  Who should he be talking to 
about this?  He is anxious to meet and I told him that as soon as we figured 
out who his legal contact would be we would meet with him.  Please let me 
know your thoughts.
Carol

Carol,

I am helping the Weather Desk to develop a new product (PJM Power Demand). It 
will initially be traded only internally.

I send you a presentation of the product and its description for EOL.

I think that we should schedule a time, so that we can discuss the product.

Thanks,

Claudio
