Scott:
I wasn't expecting a redraft from them until after our call as I think that 
the purpose of the call will be to respond to our markup.

Call Bruce's office at 212-424-8620.  By the way, did we ever receive a 
redraft of the policy from ACE?




Guys:
We are on for tomorrow at 9 Houston time to talk to ACE.  Please let me know 
who
to contact to hook you into the call.
