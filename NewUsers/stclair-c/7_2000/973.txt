Carol, I did receive the form and instructed the proper person to end your 
parking spending account deduction due to your being on leave.

Thanks,
Renee





Renee:
Just wanted to confirm that you received the parking form that you needed 
from my husband by fax this morning and that you have everything that you 
need.
