I'm sure Suzanne would help assuming that she is on the invite list.  I would 
but we are having a party at our house on the 3rd so I'll be busy taking care 
of that.

Marie is fine with either Friday June 2 or 9.  So let's pick June 2 unless 
someone has a conflict.  For quick planning (invitations, caterer, limo, 
etc.), who wants to help?  Sara
