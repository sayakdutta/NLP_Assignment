I don't but Trina may have an example of this.

 Some of these references are in carveouts where they can only help
us, but in other places they seem problematic.  I think we need to focus on
the definition of Debt and how the references to balance sheets,
particularly the reference to Consolidated balance sheets, may capture
obligations of Principal Subsidiaries we thought we were avoiding?  Do you
have an example of a definition of Debt for use in an Enron cross-default
provision that doesn't reference Principal Ssubsidiaries?

Jeff:
Now that Principal Subs has been taken out of the cross default provision,
is
there any need to refer to Subsidiaries in the definitions of Debt  or
Permitted
Receivables Purchase Facility ?
