Mark:

I think the "Welcome" is great and have no changes.  Janette is sending you 
the org chart I want to use.  
Thanks!

Mark -

I have been charting the progress of the website.  It appears to be moving 
along very well.  We hit a few snags on some of the data base issues, but 
have cleaned them up for now. 

In order to finalize a couple of areas I need to get from you any comments 
you may have on the "Welcome" information I previously forwarded, another 
copy of which I have attached below.  I also need to get from either you or 
Janette the version of the organization chart you want to have initially on 
the site.  

I have a meeting later today with the IT group working on the project.  I 
will give you a further update on the project after that meeting.
