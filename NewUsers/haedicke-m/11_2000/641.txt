(1) I presume references to the "ENA Legal Department" should remain as such 
and not be changed to the "Enron Wholesale Services Legal Department."  fyi, 
in the revised policy, ENA remains as a defined entity in that it is listed 
as a member of the "Group."yes

The Resource Group, as we last discussed it, is composed of the following: 
Dave Delainey, Mark Frevert, Julie Gomez, Steve Kean, John Lavorato, Mike 
McConnell, Michael L. Miller, Jeff Shankman, Rick Shapiro, John Sherriff and 
Greg Whalley.

(2) Should Jeff McMahon (CEO of Enron Industrial Markets) be added?yes

(3) Should Ray Bowen (COO of Enron Industrial Markets) be added?yes

(4) Should Louise Kitchen (CEO of Enron Net Works) be added?yes

Once the Resource Group is finalized and the policy is ready to go out, I 
will prepare for your review a very brief  memo (2 or 3 sentences) to each 
person on the group notifying them that they have been designated to the 
group per the new policy, which is revised to reflect the new Enron Wholesale 
Services structure.

Please reply with your thoughts.  Thanks -- Bob
