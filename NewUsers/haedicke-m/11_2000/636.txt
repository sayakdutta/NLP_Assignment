Many of you have received requests for feedback through the Performance 
Evaluation Program ("PEP") system.  This feedback is used by the Performance 
Review Committee in conducting its evaluations and also is used in preparing 
the written performance reviews.

Please take the time to complete the forms and provide candid, accurate 
feedback when it is requested.

The deadline for completing evaluation forms is November 17th.
