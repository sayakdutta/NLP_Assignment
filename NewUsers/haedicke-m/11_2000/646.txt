Mark:

I am out of the office today but am working with some folks to put together a 
draft global assets org chart.  While South America and India did not provide 
an org chart, they did provide a list of attorneys with some reporting 
information.  We will forward that back to them today in the form of an org 
chart and allow them to comment.  I will copy you on what I send out.

Bruce
