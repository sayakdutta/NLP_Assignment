Dear Mark:

I am trying to find a suitable venue and date to hold ISDA's Energy
Conference in Houston.  At the moment I have on hold Tuesday, March 6, 2001
at the Four Seasons Hotel in Houston.  

Please let me know if March 6th is a suitable date to hold Energy
Conference.  Also, please advise on the number of breakout rooms you would
recommend us to book for the afternoon sessions.  We previously had four
breakout workshops: (1) Electricity Derivatives, (2) Coal Derivatives, (3)
Weather Derivatives and 
(4) Natural Gas and Other Energy Derivatives.  

I look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,
Liz
