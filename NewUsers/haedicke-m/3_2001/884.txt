This is way too much of a commercial!  Two thirds of it speaks only to 
Kiodex.  Tell him that at least one-half should not be a commercial.  He said 
he was going to discuss new commodities and slant his presentation torward 
new commodities.  He needs to do more.

Mark,

Attached is Martin Chavez's presentation.  Is this too much Kiodex marketing
or is it ok?  We need to print asap and would appreciate your opinion.

Thanks,
