You should continue to sign the dashes and just alert me to any matter going 
to Frevert or Whalley.  Thanks.  Mark

Mark, I have not talked to you about whether you want me to sign-off on 
DASHes before they go Buy/Glisan/Skilling. I was doing so for EECC and NEPCO 
for Vicki, but you might want to revisit that.

The attached are for two of our work-out projects in the Gulf of Mexico.  
Please have a look and let me know if you want to sign DASHEs for thsi unit  
or if you prefer that I continue to sign them.

John, it looks fine to me.  The only comment that could be updated is the 
last sentence of the Other RAC Comments could be replaced with  "Horizon has 
indicated they have found another source of financing and Enron is currently 
providing information to facilitate a take-out offer from Horizon next month."
