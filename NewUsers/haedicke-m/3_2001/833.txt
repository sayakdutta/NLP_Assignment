Tim agrees that a half day legal strategy session about the pending summer 
melt down should happen sooner rather than later.   I understand that Richard 
and Elizabeth are scheduling a trip to Portland for the first week in April.  
I will coordinate their schedules with Tim's and tie down the details.  

Here is what I intend to do in the meantime.  Any thoughts or comments would 
be appreciated:

Get our major summer trading positions identified and get the contractual 
underpinings organized.  This is something that Kim Theriot's group can help 
us with.
Meet with our  fundamentals leader and our head scheduler to try to 
understand as much as we can about how  shortage scenarios might unfold and 
what power flow behavior at the key delivery points might look like.  
Meet with Steve Walters of Stoel Rives to get his mind focussed on big 
picture early positioning moves we might wish to take with BPA.
Get Marcus Wood to help us refine our understanding of BPA Surplus firm and 
Excess Federal Power and how BPA might reasonably be expected to act with 
respect to each.
Get credit to figure out if there is anyway we can get BPA to post a large 
amount of LC collateral to us.
