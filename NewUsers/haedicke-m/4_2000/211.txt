free to discuss this at your convenience.  I am hopeful this structure will 
be unregulated in Europe as well.  Mark

Mark, 

Attached is the site structure diagram we were looking at earlier.  Let me

more thoroughly.  I will also forward the clean presentation copy with I get 
it back from graphics.
