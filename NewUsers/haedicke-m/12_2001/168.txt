The situation from where I sit is fairly uncertain - as I understand it Corp has rejected our proposal and we are not sure under what authority or funding we are operating.  The preliminary list of names is as follows.  This list changes each day and includes both current employees and onew we need to get back.

A good number of these will be leaving today and not returning until I can give them some certainty on coninued employment and a retention plan.  If that happens, value lost to Corp. will be significant.
