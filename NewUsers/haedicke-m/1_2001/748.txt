Mark:

I am still coming to London, but for a very short time.  I would like to get 
together either in London on a future trip or in Houston.

Regards,

Mark Haedicke

Mark,

I am sorry that we will not be meeting up on Friday. I understand that you
have had to cancel your trip over here. Are you likely to make it over here
in the near future? If not, shall we get together at some point when I am in
the US (I'd like an excuse to get to Houston!).

All the best.

Mark
