Thanks for your comments.  I think it would be a good idea to have Jon on as 
well.  I will add Jon and Marcus to the list.  Please let them know as 
appropriate.

Regards,

Mark Haedicke

Mark,

thanks for the note. 

From the European perspective, I think the LC grouping makes sense. I think 
you definitely want Marcus on the call: Marcus will be heading all our non-UK 
European gas and power trading operations and so will be key going forward. 

Query whether you want Jon Chapman on the calls. Jon will not be doing any 
trading work but will doing the European assets work, akin to Bruce's group.

I propose that we continue to alternate the Office of General Counsel ("OGC") 
and Legal Committee ("LC") meetings of Enron Wholesale Services on Monday 
mornings at 8:30 am, Houston time.  The OGC and the LC would have the 
following members:
       
  OGC     LC
 Alan Aronowitz     OGC
 Mark Evans     Justin Boyd
 Barbara Gray     Michelle Cash
 Jeff Hodge     Steven Douglas
 Bruce Lundstrom    Peter Keohane
 Travis McCullough    John Novak
 Julia Murray     [Marcus Von Bock und Polach?]
 Elizabeth Sager     Dan Rogers
 Richard Sanders    Paul Simons
 Lance Schuler
 Mark Taylor
 Sheila Tweed
 Randy Young
 
Please give me your comments.  It is anticipated that we will continue to 
adjust the membership of both groups as the businesses continue to change.  I 
plan to address the policy committee in February.
