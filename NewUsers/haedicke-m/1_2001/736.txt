Mark -

I won't be able to attend the EWS Legal Monday meeting due to Dabhol but 
thought that I would give you a couple of updates:

I think that we have Francisco squared away -- Coralina is back from vacation 
this week.  If I can get some of Coralina's time for Puerto Rico, I feel 
covered on Central America/Carribean.

Miguel Mendoza is back from vacation this coming week as well.  I don't have 
a good feel for South America yet but think that I do now for the rest of 
Global Assets (APACHI, CALME and India).  I'm delaying my trip to India to 
spend some time with Miguel next week.

Dabhol is still pretty much the center of the Global Assets universe.  I have 
nothing to add to my Friday update that I sent to you.

I hope all is well.

Bruce
