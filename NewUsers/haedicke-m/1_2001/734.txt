What would you propose?  I am open to whatever makes sense.  Should we ask 
him to move to Sao Paulo?     Mark

John Novak's expat contract expires around March 16th.  As his supervisor, I 
need to tell him what we intend to do with it.  I would like to give him an 
indication sooner rather than later (if we are going to renew, what will be 
the term, etc.?). Please let me know your thoughts as soon as possible.  ry

Randy -- My ex-pat contract is expiring in a couple of months (March 16th, I 
think) and I'm wondering if now is the right time to start discussing 
renewal, etc.   Please let me know.  Thanks.

Rgds,
 John
