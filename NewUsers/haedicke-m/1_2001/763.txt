Mark, I am trying to find a good commercial firm in or around West Palm 
Beach, Florida that I can use as local counsel, if necessary, on a go-forward 
basis with our Advanced Mobile Power Systems transaction.  As you are likely 
aware, Enron has agreed to provide legal services to AMPS for the next six 
months, and I wanted to have available, if possible, a firm in Florida with 
which Enron is familiar and whom Enron has used before for any situations 
that require specific legal advice relating to the laws of Florida.  I am 
going to Florida to run through the legal policies with the AMPS board of 
directors and officers next week and would like, if possible, to meet with 
someone from such a firm or firms while I am there.  Do you know of or have a 
database that identifies such a law firm(s)?

Thanks
Greg Johnston
