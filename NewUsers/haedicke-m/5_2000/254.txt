At Sean's request I had lunch today with Bill Urquhart and Lamont Jones, who 
are with Quinn Emanuel in L.A.  Quinn Emanuel is a litigation firm of 
approximately 100 attorneys based in L..A.  Their client list and litigation 
record are impressive.  From what I have read and heard, they strike me as 
the "Susman Godfrey" of L.A. (and could be even better).    Bill worked with 
Jonathan Sumption on an arbitration, they became friends, and now whenever 
Bill is in London he stays in Sumption's home.  I think we should keep the 
firm in mind for California litigation and international arbitrations.
