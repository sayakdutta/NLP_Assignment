Neil,

Mark Haedicke is an ISDA Board member and works for Enron Corporation.  Mark 
is
going to be in NY next Wednesday with two other colleagues visiting NY banks 
to
discuss automating the derivatives back office and STP.  Would you be 
available
to meet with Mark and me from 1:30 to 3:00 at 270 Park.

I've cc'd Mark on this in order to cut out the telephone tag if that time 
isn't
good for you.  I am available all next Wednesday and they are visiting JPM 
from
10:00 to 12:00.

Dennis
