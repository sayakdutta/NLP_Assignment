I am not sure why that is.  Non-trading work is off a little so maybe that is 
it.  Be sure to touch base with Lance Schuler about the work he sees coming 
up.   I am happy to talk about it.  Mark

Mark, while I'm sure you're buried by the California situation, I'd like to 
get together with you when you get a chance to discuss business 
opportunities.  Despite consistently high marks for quality of work, 
responsiveness and cost-effectiveness (and despite getting feedback from 
several sources that we're the preferred firm on any deal that politically 
can be sent to someone other than V&E), we seem to be getting less business 
over the last 3-4 months than we're used to getting.  I just want to make 
sure there's not any negative issues, and assuming there are none, see what 
we can do to get more business from Enron.
 
Thanks.
