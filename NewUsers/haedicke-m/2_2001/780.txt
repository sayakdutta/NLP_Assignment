Mark Haedicke does not have his lap top computer with him so he probably has 
not seen this e-mail.

Mark,

Could you kindly confirm ASAP if you will have time for sightseeing as 
requested by Janette on her e-mail below. 
Also could you inform me at what time and where you would like the driver to 
pick you up tomorrow, February 14th afternoon, for sightseeing and/or 
transfer so as I can set up with the driver.

Thank you,

Mina Miyakawa
