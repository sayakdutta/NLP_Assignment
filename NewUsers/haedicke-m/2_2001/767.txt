Thanks for the update.  It is very important for our traders to understand 
the documentation challenges.

Apologies to Shioda-san.
He is an associate not an analyst.

Dear Mark,

Just wanted to let you know that I sent one of our young Japanese analysts 
along to an ISDA committee meeting earlier this week. His name is Takuro 
Shioda and he has been working on the commercial side with Bank of Tokyo 
Mitsubishi, with whom we are currently negotiating an ISDA master.

The ISDA people here are trying generally to get more non-legal 
non-documentary  trading types involved in the Japanese language committees 
because of how valuable this sort of feedback is in terms of practical 
application of the ISDA docs and they have indicated that they would be 
particularly  grateful for help from Enron in this regard.

None of our Japanese traders have any real ISDA experience but I have taken 
this as a first step.  We cant do much more for ISDA on this front at this 
point in time but obviously as we put ISDA masters in place and trade under 
them this situation will change.

Jane
