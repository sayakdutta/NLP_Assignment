Looks fine to me.  Thanks.  Mark

 


Mark and Jeff, 

I have finalized my plans for going to part-time status.  Effective October 1, 2001, I will work the following schedule:

Monday  off
Tuesday   8 hours
Wednesday  8 hours
Thursday 4 hours 
Friday 4 hours

I would be glad to rearrange my schedule as needed to help cover the other physical gas attorneys' vacation days.  Please let me know if my schedule is not acceptable.  I appreciate your allowing me to go part-time.
