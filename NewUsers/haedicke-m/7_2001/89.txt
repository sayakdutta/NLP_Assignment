Cc: Elbertson, Janette; Taylor, Mark E (Legal); Ruth Ainslie


Hello Mark -- just wanted to touch base before tomorrow's meeting.  Attached
is our latest attendee list.

1) John Berry w/Allen and Overy (NY) will give a 10-15 minute overview of
the European Bridge agreement.
2) Meg Timberg (Ontario Power) is set to deliver an update on the Ontario
Electricity Market.
3) I will give brief updates on the US/European Regulatory Issues
4) Will you and Travis cover: standardized provisions for Master Energy
Contracts, Convergence of Commodity Forms, Developing products and
California?
5) Material Distribution - my recommendation would be to make any necessary
materials (i.e. European Bridge Agreement presentation, Ontario Power market
presentation) available on the website after the meeting
6) Other issues ?
