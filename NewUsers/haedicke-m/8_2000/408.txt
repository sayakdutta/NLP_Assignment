Please send the following message to all of Enron Canada (Calgary/Toronto).  
By copy, I will let John or Mark decide if anything needs to be circulated in 
Houston/Portland.

"The Alberta Power Purchase Auction closed this morning, but is not final 
until the Alberta has decided to accept all bids and declare the Winning 
Bidders.  Nonetheless, various media outlets have and will be calling to 
inquire if Enron bid or was successful in bidding on any of the Plants or 
Units.  I want to again confirm that under the Auction Participation 
Agreements and Auction Rules we cannot discuss this matter with any third 
parties including the media unless and until Alberta has declared the Winning 
Bidders, and this obligation is secured by a significant Letter of Credit and 
Guarantee of Enron Corp.  Accordingly, all such inquiries are to be referred 
to Rob Milnthorp, Derek Davies or Peter Keohane for their handling."
