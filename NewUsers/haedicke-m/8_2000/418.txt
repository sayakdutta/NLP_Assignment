Mark:? We had talked about my coming on board with Enron some six years ago 
prior to my moving up to New York State Electric & Gas Corporation as their 
Chief Counsel.

Right now I am with Engage Energy as their Senior Counsel, representing the 
company's power business.? 

As you may know, we are going through a merger here (Coastal/El Paso).? As a 
part of the merger-related activity, Engage (which is a limited partnership) 
is being split as between its two owners, Westcoast and Coastal. 

Virtually all of my clients (the "big deal" Structured Power Group here at 
Engage) are moving with a subsidiary of our other owner, Westcoast, while I 
am remaiining here in Houston with Engage, which is a Coastal subsidiary.? 
So, despite the fact that power is a growth area, my propsects vis a vis the 
merger are less good than if I were still supporting a substantial client 
base.? So, I am now looking at other opportunities that may be available, 
despite the fact I have been with Engage only a year.

Attached you will find a cover letter and my resume.? I hope you find my 
credentials and background of interest and I hope to hear from you soon.

I will forward a hard copy of the attached documents to you as well.? Thank 
you.
