Mark -- We need to update FERC's records for our wholesale power marketers 
(EPMI and our plants) to list an official to receive service of certain FERC 
documents.  I believe that you are general counsel for all of these and would 
like to list you.  If something comes from FERC (which should not happen 
often), you would just forward it to me.  I need to send this information to 
FERC next week.  Is this fine with you?  

Thanks.  Christi
