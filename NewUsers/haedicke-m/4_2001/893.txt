Mark,

The Frontera transaction is making some additional progress and I am 
currently scheduled to fly to Tampa this evening to finalize the deal.  Per 
our conversation, I have revised the risk memo and am forwarding an original 
to you.  Please let me know if you think the memo is worded to strongly or 
otherwise requires some additional revision.  David Portz also sent you 
another risk memo which relates exclusively to the provision of qualified 
scheduling services (which will also be provided to Frontera under the Energy 
Management Services Agreement). 


On another note, I have received several calls from people who have read the 
latest Enron newsletter.  Apparently I am listed as being transferred out of 
ENA.  Is there anything that I should know?  Please advise.

Stuart
