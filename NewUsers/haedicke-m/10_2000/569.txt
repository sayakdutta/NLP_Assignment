According to our records all of you have some sort of high speed internet 
access to your home.  Either Cable Modem or DSL service.  When most of these 
lines where installed, we did not have a standard on how to connect back to 
the Enron network.  Most if not all of you are using the Client software on 
your PC's.  In order to provide more security to both Enron and Your PC.  We 
need to configure and deploy a Nortel Instant Internet Box.   the way the 
Nortel box works is what they call splitt tunnelling.  If it sees traffic 
that needs to go to enron it will go through the tunnel, other wise it goes 
directly to the internet.


We will need to know the following information to configure and deploy the 
Router
1. UserName and Login if required by the ISP.
2. If you have static IP addresses, We need to know that as well.
3. Co/RC to charge for the Nortel Box (Approx $500.00)


If you no longer have DSL or Cable service or You do not have either please 
let us know.  Other wise Please return the above information back to Enron 
network security.

Thanks
