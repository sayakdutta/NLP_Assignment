Although I know there are specific circumstances for Entergy and Southern's 
case (inadequate corp. guarantee language in the master agreements), I echo 
Rogers comments.  We must resolve these issues quickly.

In order to make the P&L and EOL targets that Lavo and Delainey have imposed 
on East Power for 4th qtr 2000 and calender year 2001, we must be able to 
transact with all load serving utilities and all merchant marketing shops.  
We are agressively making markets in all regions in an effort to build 
liquidity, and it is imperative to remove encumberances.

Bill Bradford & Elizabeth Sager,
Please place a high priority on cleaning up our "paper" with these 
counterparties so my traders can make markets and transact freely.

Thanks.
