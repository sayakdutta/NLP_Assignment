Mark:
John Nowlan wants to enter into a Confidentiality Agreement with Eastman 
Chemical Company in connection with discussions concerning the potential 
joint development of an internet portal.  Eastman wants Enron to agree to a 
nonsolicitation provision that would prohibit us for a period of 12 months 
from initiating hiring contacts with Eastman employees identified in a 
schedule to be attached to the Confidentiality Agreement.  Contacts with us 
initiated by Eastman employees as well as responses by Eastman employees to 
general employment advertisements would be excluded from the nonsolicitation 
provision.  John takes no exception to the nonsolicitation provision.  Under 
our Legal Department Guidelines I need your approval to go forward with this 
arrangement.  Please let me know if you approve.
Thank you for your assistance.
