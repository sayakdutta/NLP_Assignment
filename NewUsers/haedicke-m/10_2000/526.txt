I would like to convene a brief conference call next week among the speakers 
participating in the Energy Bar Association E-Commerce panel so that each 
speaker is aware of the topics that will be covered in the presentations and 
to answer any question that panelists may have.  I would expect the call to 
run approximately a half hour.  Please let me know if you would be available 
for a call on either Wednesday, October 18, or Thursday, October 19, at 1:30 
p.m. eastern time.  If those times do not work, please let me know when you 
would be available.  Thank you, and I am looking forward to an interesting 
panel.
