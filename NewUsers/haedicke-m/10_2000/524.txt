Hi Mark:

Luann Mitchell called me to schedule a trip to Houston on Wednesday 10/18 to 
meet with the paper group.

She has me set to meet with 

Bob Crane 10:30 , Ray Bowen 11:00,  Steven Klein 11:30, and Ed Quinn 12:00. 
Bryan will be out of town but told her that he has spoken with me several 
times and was confident in what these gentleman had to say.

Any thoughts, input, or suggestions?

Larry
