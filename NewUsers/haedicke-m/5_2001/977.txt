Mark, we are working with Ken Raisler to evaluate these products as an 
alternative to the other "swap" type product we talked about a few months 
ago.  Let me know if you want to stay in the loop on this at the development 
stage.  I  would suggest that we finalize with Raisler and then bring Carol 
in the loop.  

Thanks.

Attached is a narrative describing some of the products offered by Enron 
Direct USA.  We are seeking a legal opinion if these products are considered 
Swaps in the legal sense and will require the Swap Criteria language in the 
contract. 

Thanks,

Chris
