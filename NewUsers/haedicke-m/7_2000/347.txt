I understand from the Corporate Secretary that AER*X Inc. was a subsidiary of 
Enron Power Services.  AER*X Inc. has been dissolved according to the 
Corporate Secretary in 1994.  This company owned the mark AER*XTERT which 
subsequently was assigned to Enron Power Services.  As I said in my previous 
message, the mark is up for renewal.  Are we using the mark and if not, there 
would be no basis to renew it.  Can you please help me?

Thanks.
