Please add this to my schedule.  Maybe, I can fly to Toronto the next day.  
Ask Chris Gaffney if September 21 works for him instead of the dates I 
proposed in August.   Mark

Mark,

As you may know the ISDA Members Update and E-Commerce Forum will be held in
New York on September 20. The morning session will be devoted to committee
updates and the afternoon to e-commerce.  

Would you be available to give a 10 minute update on the activities of the
Energy Committee. 

Look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,

Rosemary
