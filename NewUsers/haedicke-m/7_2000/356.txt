Dear Mike,

Per direction from Cathy Phillips, here is the information about The Patent & 
License Exchange (pl-x), and its potential role in Enron's 
e-commerce/exchange initiative.

The Patent & License Exchange, Inc. (www.pl-x.com), since Jan 1999 has been 
the operator of the safest global marketplace for intellectual property 
rights.  pl-x promotes liquidity in the market through novel 
financially-oriented content and risk transfer tools backed by world-class 
companies. Strategic partners include Ernst & Young, Swiss Re, and Chicago 
Title Company (NYSE: FNF).  pl-x's most recent round of financing brought in 
$30 million in March, from a 10-member syndicate including Softbank, 
Polytechnos, Texas Pacific Group and TMCT Ventures.  The Board of Directors 
includes the most recent Commissioner of the US Patent and Trademark Office, 
Bruce Lehman and former Managing Director of Mitsubishi Electric Company, 
Takashi Kiuchi.  Subscribers include Avery Dennison, Dow Chemical, 
Bristol-Myers Squibb, Mallinckrodt, Aventis, Gateway, Honeywell, and over 190 
others.

pl-x also just received the Forbes.com "Best of the Web" award:

Enron's leadership role in the growth of online exchanges is becoming clear.  
We believe leadership in the Intellectual Property Asset Exchange space would 
be consistent with Enron's vision, and we look forward to speaking about ways 
of potentially working together.

Very best regards,
Alex Arrow
