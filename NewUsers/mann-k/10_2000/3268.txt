FYI.  I've discussed this with Mark and he didn't have any problem with it.

I've already discussed this with Mark H. and he thought it had already been 
done. I haven't found any indication that it has been done.  I'll follow up 
immediately.

Kay, as we discussed previously:

Effective immediately, I would like Ben Jacoby to have signature authority 
for his team's expense reports as well as all documents whose capital 
commitments are not greater than $250,000. Most documents will be 
confidentiality agreements, exclusivity agreements, permit applications, and 
land/equipment option agreements.

Please forward this (if need be) to the appropriate internal individuals who 
get this set up. Thanks Kay.
