Thanks for checking.  I'm on message 7 of 9, and don't have anything from 
Bruce.

Sorry I was cranking this am.  I got here at 600am, mostly because I had 
problems with a document which had to go out today.

Have you heard from Bruce Silvers?  He called and left me a voicemail that he 
was free all day Monday, but he was checking with Nick Palatin.  I haven't 
heard any more from him and was wondering if he called you.  Just following 
up.
