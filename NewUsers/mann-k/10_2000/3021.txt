I'm checking your desk for pom-poms.

To all:

Attached below please find a draft of the CRRA Filing with the DPUC regarding 
the fuel cell transaction.  There are several points that remain open that I 
would like to have cleared up by Monday afternoon.  For example, is CRRA 
filing alone or are we filing jointly?

I believe we've covered all the issues outlined by Sandra.  Please let me 
know if we've left anything out or if we need to delete anything.

I think this is a good start to us meeting our compressed timeline.  Do not 
hesitate to call me for any reason whatsoever.  The next few weeks/months are 
going to be very busy, but I know we can get to the goal line.

To quote Dave Delainey, "Go, go, go."

Regards,

Heather
