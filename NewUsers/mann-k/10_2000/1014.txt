I have the September 13th invoice.  Could you fax me the rest?

Thanks,

Kay

PS.  I feel like I had previously approved at least one of these invoices.  
We have changed accounting systems and invoice processing personnel, so just 
about anything is possible.

Kay: Our financial department reports that the invoices for our work
related to the Midwest Energy Hub, dated June 21, July 24, August 14 and
Sept. 13 are as yet unpaid. Would you look into this for me?  Let me know
if additional information is needed. Thanks
