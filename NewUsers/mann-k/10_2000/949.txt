Chris:

Attached is Change Order #2 for your review. It would probably be a good idea 
if you executed it rather than Janet since it pertains to one of your 
projects. If you have any issues / changes / questions, let me know. Also let 
me know if you need any assistance regarding the DASH for this change order.

Regards,

Ben
