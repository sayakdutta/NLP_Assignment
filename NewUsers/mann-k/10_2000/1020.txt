Kay -- I expect to have a preliminary draft of the Credit Agmt and a related 
closing documents list to you tomorrow morning.  Once you get that and have a 
chance to look at it and forward it to whomever else needs to look at it, 
let's set up a call.

Thanks!  Heather



Once I get the draft I will set up a conference call with the people who
can provide the input on the document.  If it would be better to have the
call before let me know, and I will try to set it up.  I'm free tomorrow am
if that is a good time for you.

Kay -- We've started on a draft of the Credit Agmt, but it will have a lot
of holes in it.  Have there been any further discussions re:  the specific
terms of the loan (financial covenants, etc.), how the guaranties will
work, etc.?

Thanks!  Heather
