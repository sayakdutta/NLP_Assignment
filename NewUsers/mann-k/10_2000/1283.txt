Hi Paul,

I would like to  change my previous response to this email.  I would like to 
get a cleaned up version of the GE contract (without WestLB references) so 
that I can make a wider internal distribution without having to explain the 
references to WestLB.

The intial read from GE was positive, but the devil is in the details, of 
course.

Kay:  references to WestLB are in only a few places in the GE Contract; 
namely, the recitals and sections 3.8(c)(2), 5.1, 6.1, 7.2.4, 30.7 and 
30.12.  The references in the recitals, 3.8(c),7.2.4, 30.7 and 30.12 can be 
handled fairly easily.  The references in 5.1 and 6.1 deal with pricing 
matters and will require a little work once the pricing mechanism is worked 
out with GE.  My suggestion would be to not revise the document at this time 
and make these changes at the same time we make any other changes arising 
from the discussions with GE.  PLease let me know what you think.  Regards, 
Paul



Thanks.  This is a  very drastic situation, so the draft will be
appreciated.

As I recall you were going to turn another draft of the GE facility
agreement, deleting the WestLB references.  When will this be forthcoming?

Thanks,

Kay

Peter Thompson is working on it.  We should have a draft Wednesday.

Paul,

When can we expect a draft of the ABB facility agreement? It is getting
urgent.

Thanks,

Kay
