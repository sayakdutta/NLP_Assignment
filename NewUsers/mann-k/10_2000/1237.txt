Hi Charlotte,

I'm glad you wrote, as I was going to write you.

Michael has strep (as do I), so he and I are home today.  He is on two 
antibiotics which he takes twice a day.  I'm trying to figure out how to get 
these to you, since these have to be refrigerated.  Obviously, if Michael  
isn't doing great I won't go.  Currently, he feels fine, and only feels bad 
when he has fever. He woke up with fever again this am, but the fever should 
go away after 24 hours on the antibiotics.  Just let me know if you aren't 
comfortable with  the situation.  I can always leave on Saturday, or not at 
all.

Michael's doctor is Rey Calderon 713 520 9550.  His wife (and assistant) is 
Delores, and they are wonderful about returning calls, etc.

We will be staying at the Hyatt Hill Country Resort, 210 647 1234. Saturday 
night I will be staying in Round Rock (going to Paige's homecoming in 
Georgetown), but Neil will still be at the Hyatt.

Michael says hi, by the way.  He is watching me type this.

   Don't forget to let me know where you will be staying in San
Antonio.  Also, what is Michael's doctor's last name.  I know it's Reynaldo
something.

   Thanks.  Have a great time and don't worry about Michael.
