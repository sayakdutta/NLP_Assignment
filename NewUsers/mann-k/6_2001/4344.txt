Hi Billy,

Can you take a look at this since the Hermanator is out?

Thanks,

Hello.

The commercial team  has asked that I forward this document to you for 
review.  It is a development agreement for a project in Florida.  We have 
attempted to address the accounting/E-Next issues, but please advise of any 
desired changes.

Thank you,

Kay



PS  Pardon the formatting.  It will be cleaned up by those with the ability 
to do so.
