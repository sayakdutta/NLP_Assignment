I'm sorry. TECO and Ft. Pierce Utility Authority.

    
            
     I need the name of the other party involved in Ft Pierce so that John
     can clear conflicts.



     
          cc:

     
     Can we assume this will also cover Ft. Pierce?

         
                                
        Mark Haedicke approved the hiring of King & Spalding for this
        matter.  I will drop Mr. Derrick a voice mail, but I would faint if
        he objected.

        John, we need to talk about the sale of the LLC, and the generation
        of a draft doc re same.  Please let me know if you are available
        today to discuss this transaction with Sr. Jacoby and me.
        Additionally, it would be helpful to discuss the tolling
        arrangement with Ken.

        Thanks,

        Kay
