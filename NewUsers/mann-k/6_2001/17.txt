I received a letter from Westinghouse in response to our threat to draw on=

the letter of credit.  A copy is being delivered to you today.  I have spok=

to Patty Clark (Asst. General Counsel for Allegheny) about what we are doin=

and she didn=01,t seem overly concerned but asked to be kept in the loop.  =
I=20
told her that Enron was very sensitive about the potential impact that our=

threats against Westinghouse might have on Allegheny=01,s contractual=20
relationship with them.  Personally, I don=01,t think that we should draw o=

letter of credit (even though I believe that we are entirely in the right o=

this one) because it might somehow hurt Allegheny.  I don=01,t, however, wa=

take the heat off of Westinghouse so I have not said anything.

We had a call with Westinghouse yesterday to discuss the facts surrounding=

our claim and have a follow up call scheduled for Wednesday (6/13) at 3:00=

either side have not participated in discussions as they have been primaril=

fact-finding in nature.  I am happy to give you an update as to what has=20
happened and what I expect to occur on Wednesday at your convenience.

Take care,
