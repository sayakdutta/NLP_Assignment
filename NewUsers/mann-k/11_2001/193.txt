The document below contains the guts of the tasking letter, I believe.  The GSA was in the other email.

 

That must be it then.  I'll be glad to route the CAF, is the below the final document?
Thanks again,

Adriana  
 

I'm happy to look at another format.  This was the one Michelle gave me.

Kay,
I have everything I need with the exception of the wbs. coding, contact name, physical address and tax ID #.   I believe Allan is getting all that info for us.
We will be using this format from now on? 
Best regards,

Adriana

I forgot to include the draft copy (it's been one of those days)
