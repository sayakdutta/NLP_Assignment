Thanks.

 

I aint making any payments until we get the official okeydokey.

 

We don't want to pay them until we get agreement to the form of the docs.  I don't think much will be required, but I just want to make sure it is coordinated.

I'll take all the help and advise that you wish to offer.

 

And me?
