In hindsight we should have had them pay it.  Oh well.

Got your fax and will check in to others.




These are the costs and fees charged to us by CT to effect the name change
of the LLC, which you will recall NorthWestern needed done on the closing
date.  Thanks for getting it into the queue.




John,

There is a $739 charge from CT Corp. on invoice #186444 (re Blue Dog).
Can you send me an email with a brief explanation?  I want to get this
in the queue.

Ciao,

Kay
