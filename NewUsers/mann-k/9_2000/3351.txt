I have not dropped it off yet.  Can he be set up for Monday?








I just left you a vm.
The Lunch Service just called back and told me not to send the money to
them. Instead to give it to the school. Did you drop off the contract and
other stuff this morning?  If so I can go by and take care of the lunch
issue.

Sharon Seals called. We have a 2:30 10/9 and maybe a 5:30 each Monday for
the rest of October. She will get back to us on the latter.

Write when you can. I love you. NM
