Hi Bob,

Does this have anything to do with the Wisconsin site you mentioned in the 
staff meeting?

Thanks,

Kay

Attached is the draft term sheet for the WEPCO term sheet on the Plano site.  
I have used the 9/01 clean version of the ComEd Plano term sheet as the 
template for this document.

I have made some changes to reflect our discussions with WEPCO including the 
following:

 1. Term (3 and 5 year)
 2. Contract Base Capacity Charge ($ amount may be subject to further change)
 3. Scheduling (day-ahead only)
 4. Project Updates (term modification dates changed to reflect 3 or 5 year 
term)
 5. Commercial Operation Date Guarantee (dates change to reflect '02 start 
date/termination right triggered off of 6/1/01 notice by Seller)
 6. Delay/Early Completion Penalties/Bonus (changed to reflect different 
Capacity Charge)
 7. Availability LD's (changed to reflect different Capacity Charge)

Please review and send me your comments.  I am planning to send this document 
to WEPCO tomorrow afternoon. 

Thanks,
Fred
