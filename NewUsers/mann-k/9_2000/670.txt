After hearing back from everyone, a meeting is scheduled for 3:00 today to 
discuss the cash management needs of enovate (formerly known as MEH).  Sam 
has reserved conference room 2718 for all of you in Houston.  Once you are 
all together, just call me.  Thanks for everyone's flexibility on short 
notice.
