employees or inventory in any other states.  It is my understanding that it 
will not. 

Gregg, Russell, Matt, please speak up if I'm missing something.

to enovate.  

Please advise when everyone is in agreement as to which states we need to be 
qualified in so that I may prepare the necessary documents.  Thanks, Teresa

Russell,

I don't believe we intend to qualify in all of those states.

enovate.  

Per our conversation this morning, please revise the name change documents to 
reflect enovate with a lower case "e" rather than Enovate.

We will be distributing marketing materials in Illinois, Indiana, Texas, 
Wisconsin, Michigan, Iowa, Alberta (Canada).  

Thanks for your assistance.  Let me know if you need anything.
