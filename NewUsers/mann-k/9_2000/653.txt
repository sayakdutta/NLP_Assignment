Hi Ben,

Hope Day 1 of your daughter's illustrious academic career went well.  

We are hoping to meet tomorrow at 130 Central in 38C2 to discuss GE issues.  
Sheila says you won't be here quite that soon, but it would be very helpful 
if you could join us once you get here.  Time permitting, we can discuss the 
ESA transaction once we are done with the GE stuff.

See you soon,

Kay
