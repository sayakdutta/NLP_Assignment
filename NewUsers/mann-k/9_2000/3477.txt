Sorry for the inconvenience.  Ozzie had to leave town, and he wanted to 
participate in the first meeting. I'm sure we will get something worked out.

Kay--as indicated in my voicemail, I will definitely be out of pocket on 
Wednesday.  The meeting is supposed to go into Thursday and I fly back Thurs 
eve, but it is possible that it would finish up early enough on Thursday that 
I could schedule a call for Thursday afternoon.  I'll call you later.



Due to a last minute conflict, we need to reschedule this meeting.  How
does everybody look for Wednesday?

Sorry for any inconvenience.

Kay









The meeting regarding the above-referenced subject will be held tomorrow,
September 19, 2000, at 9:00 a.m. in 20C2.  Refreshments will be served.

Nancy, Kay, et al. will call you in the morning.
