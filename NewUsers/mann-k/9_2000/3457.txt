John S is in the last stages- Once done- I would like to come visit with 
you-  I am working Rio Gen (Brazil- ESA job) which is an EPC being done under 
97-10- great fun.  I will holler as soon as John S releases his doc.  I will 
want to involve Cheryl Costa because she has EECC responsibility for a couple 
ENA EPC's plus she was up to her ears in off balance sheet on the Blue Girl 
turbine.







Hi guys,

Just wanted to check to see if there is a "go by" affiliate EPC contract, 
destined to be 97 10 compliant?  I'm ready to start working on it from ENA's 
standpoint.

Thanks,

Kay
