I'm attaching a revised draft of the option to purchase the land for the 
VEPCO deal.  I've limited it to the land in Edgecombe County, changed the 
initial period to 90 days (with 3 x 90 day renewals).  The price is changed 
to $137,600, as have the option payments ($3500 for each 90 day period).  Is 
there anything else which needs to be changed?



FYI, I've left a message for Dutch Bumgarnder, VEPCO's lawyer, concerning the 
interconnection agreement, and who is doing what.

Thanks,

Kay
