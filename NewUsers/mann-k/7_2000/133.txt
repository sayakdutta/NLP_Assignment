Sheila,

I believe I can help Lisa with this information, at least confirming some of 
the stuff for her.

As requested, attached is a listing of the turbine inventory.  Because the 
payment/termination schedules are not consolidated into one file, I will send 
you a hard copy of this information this afternoon.
