Boyd,

I am not sure you have seen this agreement.  If you haven't, please give it a 
look for "fatal flaws", or information you think we need to be informed.

Thank you,

Kay

Kay - Sounds like Jeff is okay with the affiliate Master Purchase Sale 
Agreement from an Enron transactional point of view.  As this document will 
be filed with the ICC, I want to make sure that Boyd is agreement.  Assuming 
Boyd gives the all clear, we need to decide if we intend to file this right 
away or wait for the Hub Agency Agreement to be completed and make a joint 
filing.  However, I am cautiously optimistic that we are not too far apart on 
the Hub Agreement.  We had a commercial meeting yesterday and despite the 
obstacles presented by my supposed MEH partner, Roy, I think we made some 
headway.

Talk to you later,

Gregg
