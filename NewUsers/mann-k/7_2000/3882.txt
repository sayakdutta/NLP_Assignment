Sounds good.

We may not need the entity in New York yet, as we are looking at getting a 
free option, not anonymous.  Deals kind of funky.

Correct on the Edgecombe (North Carolina) thing.

So you need a new entity for New York and verification that Edgecomb does not 
hold land purchase options in North Carolina.  Am I on the right track?
