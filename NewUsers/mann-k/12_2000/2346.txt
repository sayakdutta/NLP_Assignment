Kay/Chris:

Ben asked me to get involved in the NRG deal(s) that we are working on.  As I 
understand it, we are working on 2 potential deals:

 1.  With the NRG San Diego group on the sale of the [March 2001] GE 7EA.

 2.  With the NRG Thermal group on the sale of one or more LM 6000 turbines.


Ben indicated that we need to have a CA in place that covers the delivery of 
transaction documents to the San Diego group.  Ben also mentioned that Jim 
Gilbert (Enron West Coast) has executed a CA with the NRG Thermal group.

Kay:  Does the CA executed with the NRG Thermal group contain language that 
covers the delivery of documents to both NRG groups?

Chris:  Has any form of draft CA been provided to the NRG San Diego group?

Please let me know the answers to these questions.  I am in the office all 
this week and will work with both of you to help move these deals forward.

Fred
