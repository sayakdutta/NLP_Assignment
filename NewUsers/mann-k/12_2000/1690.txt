It really doesn't matter to me who handles GE signature.  I'd like to get a

If it's ready to be signed by us and GE, either Kay or I can get it Kent 
Shoemaker and Steve Swift for approval.  As a practical metter as long as we 
have the right number on the CO and it conforms to the form, you could 
probably handle it directly.  What are your thoughts Kay?
