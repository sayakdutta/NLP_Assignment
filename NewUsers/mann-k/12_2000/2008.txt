Lee,

If this will be a dual fuel unit, it seems we should at least have a place 
holder guarantee, even if the details aren't included.  Any problem with that 
approach?

Kay/Peter- 

We don't need a liquid fuel guarantee at this time, since we don't know
where the dual fuel units are going.  When that is determined, we will
provide the LF guarantee at the time the site conditions are known.  Let's
press on.

Thanks,

Lee

       Attached please find a clean copy of the latest draft of the
E-Next Generation CISO1 Agreement and Exhibits, as well as blacklines
showing changes made to each from the prior draft we circulated.  This
is identical to the documents for the CISO2 documents but for the unit
number and agreement reference.  To complete the agreement, we need Ben
Jacoby's fax number and a liquid fuel performance guarantee. As for the
exhibits, we need the information for Part B of Exhibit A-1.  We will
also need to add Exhibit H-2, Exhibit R (if necessary) and confirmation
that we will not have any site specific information usually contained in
Exhibit U.
