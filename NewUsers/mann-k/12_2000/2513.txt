The second sentence of Section 17.4.1 of the Facility Agreement should
be revised to read as follows:

"If the Maximum Liability Amount (less any unpaid portion of the

between such amount and the Proper Scope Value (the "Refund Amount")
shall be settled between the parties in accordance with Section 17.4.4
below."
