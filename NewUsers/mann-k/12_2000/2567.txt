Attached for your review is a revised letter agreement marked to show the
changes made from the draft received yesterday from F&J. Also attached is a
draft of the letter agreement with respect to the second LLC.  A draft of
the letter agreement with respect to the transformer will follow shortly.

I understand that we are to discuss these documents at 11 AM today.  In the
interest of time, these drafts are being distributed without having been
reviewed by Enron.
