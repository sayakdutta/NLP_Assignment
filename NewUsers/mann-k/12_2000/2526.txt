Because of schedules, we would like to cancel the 10 AM call, and proceed 
with the noon call. I apologize for the inconvenience. Please let me know if 
this does not work for you all.

Thanks,

Ben








Attached is a revised draft of the Letter Agreement which has been
redlined to show the changes from ENA's last draft.  I am also attaching
an insert which such be substituted for Section 6.2(e) of the LLC
Agreement.
