I thought we weren't going to have an exhibit U anyway, since we are plugging 
things into the text of the document.

I think the real point of the question is the reference to the liquid fuel 
guarantees, and where these will be reflected.

If we aren't going to have any site specific information, then I don't
think we need an Exhibit U.




Ben decided to send the exhibits to Coral, so that's where this question
came from.

Will we have an exhibit U?

I know we owe you some answers from your email of the 6th.

Ben, Exhibit U indicates that liquid fuel guarantees are in Sec. 10.8.4.
I
could not fine them in that section.  Could you point me to where the
liquid
fuel guarantees are located?
