I left around midnight last night.  Not too bad if you don't have to do it 
often.  I need to deal with ABB today.  

Hope you are sleeping!

If you have one-train plus two-trains, do you have three trains?  Do you need 
a ticket to override?  Just kidding.  Hope you're done and gone for 
Yesterday!!!
