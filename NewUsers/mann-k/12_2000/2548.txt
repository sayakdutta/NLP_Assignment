The good news is they agreed to the current form of the acknowledgement 
letter, and will send us a letter stating they will sign the letter as is

Hi guys,

We can't sell the acceleration of the put to GE.  Although off the record
they will agree to it, for internal reasons they don't want to go on record
with it.

I'll catch up later.
