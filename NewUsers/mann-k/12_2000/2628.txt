Attached is a revised draft of the acknowledgement letter which Tejas
would require from GE as a condition to closing.  The letter has been
revised to incorporate the substance of the changes which Don and I
discussed with Ben Jacoby this morning.  Additional changes to the
letter may be needed after Coral has seen and reviewed the Facility
Agreement.
