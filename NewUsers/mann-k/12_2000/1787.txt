This is so nice.  She is one of the lawyers at ENA.  I feel very flattered 
that she invited me.  Surely it isn't Amway!

Please stop by my house after work on Friday, December 15 for a glass of wine 
and a moment of calm during the hectic holiday season.  Come anytime between 
6:00 and 7:30.   Hope to see you all!!!

My address is 3029 Reba Drive.  Just take Allen Parkway to Kirby and then 
turn right on Reba (between San Felipe and Westheimer).  My house will be on 
your left.
