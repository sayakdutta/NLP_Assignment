At the time I asked you to set it up I did not not the Joe Defner and Mike J 
Miller would be attending.




There isn't one up here, I looked yesterday. I'll look elsewhere.  Please 
tell me when you ask me to set up the meeting if you will need a conference 
room.

Please see if you can get a conference room for the 300 call.  If there isn't 
one here, try 28 or 29.  Thanks, Kay
