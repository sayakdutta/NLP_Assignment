Accomplishments: I haven't jumped out the window yet, or slapped/cursed 
anyone from any other Enron entity.  This is significant in a way that not 
all would understand.  Vision & Values.

My other significant accomplishment was the LM 6000 deal: revising the 
structure, figuring out how to sell the WestLB stuff to GE/S & S,  and 
closing it in a relatively short period of time.

More to come!

As for vacation, I'll scatter some days off here and there, but I don't have 
any plans for consecutive days off.
