Jeff,

I don't know if our group needs anyone, but I wanted to pass this resume 
along.  I worked with Carlos when I was at EECC, and I rate him highly.  
He'll take on anything, has good people skills, works hard, and has a varied 
transactional background.  As an added bonus, he is fluent in Spanish.

EECC is being plopped into EES, and Carlos would prefer to make the move to 
ENA (or EA, whatever we are called). He discussed this with Vicky, so she is 
aware that he is checking out opportunities here.

Thanks,

Kay

Kay, as we've discussed before, I'm interested in pursuing the opportunities 
available in the ENA legal group.  As you know, my experience at EECC in 
addition to focusing on traditional EPC contracts and joint venture 
agreements, has also included cross-border financing agreements and merger 
and acquisition activity.  Before coming to Enron as you recall, I worked 
with a New york based firm here in Houston where I focused mostly on 
transactions in Mexico since we represented Pemex on their transactions 
involving long and short term oil supply agreements and CFE (Mexico's 
electricity commission) on its public bids for EPC and IPP projects.  Lastly, 
I started my legal career in 1994 at Patton Boggs in DC where I focused on 
general domestic corporate transactions such as establishing new business 
entities (ie, joint venture work, partnerships etc.), m & a work, and 
securities offerings.  Thanks for your help.
