Peter,

Go ahead and complete the draft with what you have, and transmit it to me 
with a list of questions which need to be answered to finish it.

Thanks,

Kay







I have not yet received any response from Eric Boyt.  If possible, I
would like to receive that information today or early tomorrow so that I
can complete the agreement and leave the office by close of business
Wednesday.
