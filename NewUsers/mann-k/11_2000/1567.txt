This is the last email I have on the issue of consequentials/LOL.  As I 
recall, we have not agreed to the redaction of the carve out of the LOL for 
gross negligence, but it is an important issue for GE.  

Steve Swift wants to close out these issues.  Are we ready, or do we need 
this for a swap for something?

Folks,

Here is some language for discussion this afternoon.  Please note that this
is being submitted for discussion without full management approval; we're
getting so close to the bone that we'll probably need to take the final
package as a whole through our vetting process

I'm looking through the warranty section now, so perhaps we can discuss that
as well.

Ciao,


 Mike
