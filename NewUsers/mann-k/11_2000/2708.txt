Michael says that you and he will be putting up Christmas decorations this 
evening "straight away"  "before nightfall"  etc.  Of course, it is a good 
thing to do at night so long as it isn't raining.

I was thinking it would be fun to have a family outing this weekend instead 
of sitting around the house.  Maybe Moody Gardens?  That seems like a fun 
place to go. 

What do you think?
