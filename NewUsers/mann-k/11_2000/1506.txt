You are right on all points (especially the punting one!).  You should have 
the list of specific "fill in the blank" stuff which I forwarded recently.  
Also, we had a discussion yesterday with GE on the form of the 
assignment/assumption agreement, so there shouldn't be anything required of 
you from that standpoint.  

I'm here today (wasn't yesterday) and will be happy to discuss it with you.

Kay,

I recognize that you would like to punt this "break out contract" thing as 
soon as possible; but, I would like to visit with you briefly about how any 
transition might work.  As I appreciate it, once the form of break out 
contract is complete, most of the hard work is done.  What types of 
modifications are envisioned for each of the break outs?  I assume that just 
a few things would change (for example (i) price, (ii) number of units, (iii) 
delivery points, and (iv) a pro rating of LD's).  Am I grossly 
underestimating the amount of work that will be required.  Please advise.

Stuart
