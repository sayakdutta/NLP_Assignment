Hi Peter,

Do you have a new ETA yet?  I need to manage expectations on this end.

Thanks,

Kay









I should have the revised agreement to you by 11 AM CST.  I had hoped to
have it to you earlier, but we have experienced some technical
difficulties as a result of the conversion of our system over the
weekend.
