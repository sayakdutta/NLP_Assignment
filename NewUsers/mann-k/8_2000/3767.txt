Hi Mike,

In a meeting Friday afternoon with Ben Jacoby, he mentioned that he didnt 
want the change order signed quite yet. I suspect he wants to review it 
before it is signed, and he's on vacation this week.

Mike,

Attached for your review and signature is Change Order No. 2 to the LM6000 
Purchase Agreement.  I am forwarding it to Kay and David for their approval 
for you.
