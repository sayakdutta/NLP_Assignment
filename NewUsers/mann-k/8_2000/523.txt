At least drinks and coffee. Thanks for thinking of it.




I sent an email to everyone (actually just replied to your email but to all) 
that the meeting will be held in 27C1.

Since it's a 2 hour meeting, would you like coffee and soft drinks and 
breakfast food?  Please advise.

In an effort to pull the pieces together, a meeting has been scheduled to 
discuss the draft energy and capacity contract (formerly the PPA).  It is 
scheduled for Thursday, August 24th, at 900am.  We are still in the process 
of locating a conference room, so the location is TBD.

Thanks,

Kay

Some of you may have received this already.  I have not compared it against
