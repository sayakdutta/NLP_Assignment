A conference call on Friday, August 18, at 10:30 EST; 9:30 your time is
fine.  I am faxing out shortly a copy of the following documents:
   1.  an agenda for the call
   2.  the scheduling dates, which will be helpful to keep in mind
   3.  the revised data request
   4.  the local government resolutions
