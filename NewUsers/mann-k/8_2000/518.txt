If it didn't come up when you put your cursor on it and click, then you'll 
have to type in the address in address space when you are on the internet.  
Or, you can search Paige Record Southwestern University on the web and find 
it.

Hope this helps.

Enjoyed your note. How do I get Paige's web site to come up? Love,Mother
