Suzanne,

I left the response (which is a letter from Siemens Westinghouse) on the part 
of my desk which is next to the window.  I MAY have put it in a file folder 
labeled "Westinghouse".  The letter references a letter we sent to them in 
the first line.  Please find the letter and fax to Bill.  Thanks a bunch.

Bill, 

I'm attaching an electronic copy of the letter we sent to Westinghouse.  If 
you email me your fax number, I'll fax you their response.

Thanks,

Kay
