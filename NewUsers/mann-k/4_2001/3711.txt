I think she will have a great time.  The moms and dads are very friendly.  
She'll probably know some of them!








I tried...NM




   Absolutely not.  I will leave work at 3:00 and can be at the party
by 4:00.  Just let me know what the kid's name is so we will get in the
right party.  I'm just training a junior secretary and it's ABSOLUTELY NO
PROBLEM.  I enjoy the parties.




Charlotte,
I just realized the party starts at 4 pm at the Houstonian. I don't what you
to have to take off early from work for this. Let's just have you do the
normal pick up on Tuesday and I will handle the party on Wednesday. NM




   I have this on my book and will cover Tuesday and Wednesday (24 &
25).  Let me know how early I should pick him up at school as it is no
problem for me to get away early.

   In fact, I enjoy these kid birthday parties.
