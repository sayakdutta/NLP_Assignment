I don't feel as bad as I did when I woke up.  My face hurt so badly.  Neil 
was so sweet bringing me hot washcloths.  It really helped. I'm running a low 
grade fever, and I know it is a sinus infection.  I took a really hot shower 
around 5 this morning, but it didn't help much.  Advil helped!  I spent a lot 
of time outside yesterday, and I'm paying for it.







Yes, I knew about both of them.  You know I have my 
sources to keep me informed as to what's going on.  I 
figured Bob Carter would leave.  It was just a feeling.  
I guess Sheila will have to replace him and Al Larsen in 
Portland.  I bet she's a crazy woman.

Oh, you should see the roots on my hair!  I'm so glad 
I'm getting it done on Thursday!  I look like a skunk!  
Thank goodness my hair is curly!!!!!  I was thinking 
about putting on some makeup to go to the doctor, but I 
think not.  I'll do good to get my hair dry!  I'm 
feeling tired today, but maybe it's because I didn't 
sleep all that well last night.  I've been so hot lately 
and having nightsweats.  What fun getting older is!

Are you feeling any better?
