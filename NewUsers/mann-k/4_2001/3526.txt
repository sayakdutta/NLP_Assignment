Attached please find the latest LV Cogen Turbine Agreement (second
document below), as well as a blackline (first document below) showing
changes made to the version circulated on April 5. The only changes are
to the performance guarantees in Sections 10.7 and 10.8.  To complete
the agreement, we will need to insert the date of execution and Exhibit
H-2.
