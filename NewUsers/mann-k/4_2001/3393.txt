Kay and Ben,

Per my conversation with Ben, I have revised the offer to now read:

Lynn ,

In an effort to expeditiously resolve our issues regarding the damaged 
generator, we suggest the following offer, subject to ENA Management approval 
and the execution of the appropriate documents:

Enron will pay Siemens Westinghouse $1,500,000 towards the cost of the 
Replacement Generator.
Enron and Siemens Westinghouse agree to split the proceeds of the insurance 
claim on a 50/50 basis up to the point where Enron has recouped their 
$1,500.000 payment
Any insurance proceeds recovered in excess of $3,000,000 ($1,500,000 to 
Enron, $ 1,500,000 to Siemens Westinghouse) are to Siemens Westinghouse 
account.
By Siemens Westinghouse acceptance of this offer, Enron waives its claim to 
Delivery Liquidated Damages


Example:

Enron Payment to Siemens Westinghouse:   $1,500,000

Insurance Proceeds from Damaged Generator   $4,000,000     
 Enron's share of insurance proceeds:   $1,500,000  =($4,000,000 x 0.5) up to 
$1,500,000
 Siemens Westinghouse's share of insurance proceeds: $2,500,000  = 
($4,000,000 - $1,500,000)


This suggestion is for settlement purposes only, and is without prejudice to 
any rights or positions of Enron or Siemens Westinghouse.
