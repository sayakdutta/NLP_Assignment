Isabel,

Unless I'm missing something, two of these documents are the same (93), and 
we are missing the no objections to forms letter.

We attached clean and blacklined copies of the ENA Consent and Agreement,
the ENA no objection to forms letter and the Hancock entitlement letter,
marked to show minor changes from the versions last circulated.

We would be grateful for your confirmation that these are in final form.

Kind regards
Isabel
