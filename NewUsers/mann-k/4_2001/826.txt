I've raised some of the issues with NW.  We are working on some of it.  A 
meeting is a good idea.

Folks:

With respect to the Northwestern transaction, I'd like to understand what it 
would take in the letter agreement to allow us to recognize the entire $8MM 
upon execution of the letter agreement. In my conversation today with Kay, we 
talked about making sure we could at least recognize the $8MM in equal 
instalments between the execution of the letter agreement and September 1, 
2001 (the outside date for closing). If at all possible, I'd like to take 
this one step further so that the entire amount could be recognized in Q2. 
Let's plan to talk about this on Monday. Any thoughts on this prior to Monday 
would be appreciated.

Regards,

Ben
