Final version agreed to by April 11th.







Is that a completed contract by 4/11 or the draft out for review?





We are supposed to try to have the break out contract by April 11, and I
think the consents and stuff that same week.

What's your scheduling like on this one




Hi Kent,

I can get a redline done for you if you want to tell me what it should be
redlined against.

I don't know about getting rid of the requirement for the inhouse counsel
opinion.  Maybe after you look at things we can discuss it.

Thanks,

Kay

showing changes made to the version circulated last Friday.  Pursuant to
your instructions, the performance values in Article 10 are per the 24
Unit master agreement.  In addition no changes have been made to the
Maximum or Unit Liability Amounts or payment schedule. To complete the
agreement, we will need to insert the date of execution and Exhibit H-2.
