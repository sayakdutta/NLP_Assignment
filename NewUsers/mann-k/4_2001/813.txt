Kay - 

I just spoke with Marvin, he seems pretty happy--just a few comments so far:

? the arbitration/dispute resolution clause needs to reflect what is in the 
LOI
? weekends are not included in the definition of off-peak hours


Marvin, David and Robert are still reviewing and look to have additional 
comments by early next week.
