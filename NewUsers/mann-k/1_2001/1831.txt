Have you asked Rusty?  I believe Kathleen gave him a hard copy yesterday.  I 
made the changes myself.

Kay:

What is the status of the draft Securities Purchase Agreement for the sale of 
ENA's Illinois project entities?

Please let me know.  Rusty and I need to review it before sending it out to 
PSEG.

Thanks,
Fred
