Hi guys,

Here's a suggested revision to the invoicing language.

Lee, I've asked the question about the other invoices.  If we don't get an 
immediate answer, I think you can send the invoices to Ben, and we can 
process them here.  I'm always happy to volunteer Ben.  By the way, I haven't 
given Ben his signing party favor, as he hasn't been in Houston since we last 
met.

Attached are clean copies of the CA Development Agreements showing the
changes to the invoice provision and removal of the  periods in "LLC",
as well as blacklines showing that those were the only changes made to
the agreements.
