Sounds great.  I'm starving also.




Ok, made the reservation for noon under Adams.  I'll leave Carlos a voice 
mail asking him to meet us there ok (since he has a meeting).  This all ok 
with you?

I love Vincent's and it is close, so I say we go for it.




So, should I make reservations?  Is there somewhere else you'd rather go?  
I'm starving!

I haven't talked to anyone.  I've got 10 docs going out this am, but I'm 
almost finished.




Sheila can't go today because of work.  Carlos called, is he still going?  
It's your birthday lunch, what do you want to do.

Sounds good, but if today isn't a good day, it is not a problem.
