Could you check with Ben to see if he wants a set?


   
	
	
		


Transacti on  

I say hard bind the originals and get one set of GBC bound (easier to 
photocopy) if we need to.  Do you think we will need more than 2 sets?

Kay:
 
We have the closing volume for the ENA/SEL turbine and transformer
transaction ready for reproduction.  We have one complete set of originals
and one set with partial originals.  Please let me know whether you want
these originals sets in redwells or bound in some manner.  Also, please
advise whether you wish to have additional copies velobound,  GBC bound
(reduced and double sided for working copies), or hardbound, as well as the
number of each.  Thanks.
