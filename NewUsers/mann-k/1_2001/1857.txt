I was supposed to make a "To Do" list of the World Hunger Team:

Limit of liability/Indemnity - Steve has provided a draft.

Assignment - although we reached an accord for TurboPark purposes, the basic 
issues remain for discussion.

Confidentiality - Mike has circulated a revised draft.

Termination - This ones on my list.

Warranty - Scott has some comments to discuss.

We also discussed streamlining the time lines, etc.
