It happens to all of us!

I still have a bizillion roses in my yard.  I love them, and I don't baby 
them.  I figure if they die, I replace them, since they aren't that expensive.

I would love to include my friend Carlos Sole from EECC for my birthday lunch.

I only invited Dan and Sheila.  Dan has rsvpd yes, but I don't think Sheila 
has even had a chance to look at her emails.  Want to keep it just us?  Where 
would you like to go?  I'm going to put it on our calendars.  Would you like 
to invite Neil too?

Oh, I decided I'm going to start growing roses since mine have done so well.  
I'm going to put them in pots though (to start).  I like it that I can cut 
them and put them in vases in the house.  I have to have something to put in 
all the pretty vases I have.  I've ordered a Purple Chariot Miniature, Fairy 
Polyantha, Red Fairy Polyantha, Cancun Hybrid Tea Rose (this is gorgeous), 
and Yellow Magic Rose (for borders). Those hibiscus are pretty but they only 
last one day.  Uh oh, I'm turning into Mother!!!!!

Sounds good.  I prefer to keep it kind of small, if that's ok with you.

Thanks,

Dan and I (so far) would like to take you to lunch on your birthday.   I see 
you are free on your calendar, but I didn't know if you already have 
tentative plans.  Would you like to go?
