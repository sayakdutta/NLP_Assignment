Hi Brett,

I haven't seen the fax yet.  I'll check around.  Maybe it got stuck in the 
wrong pile.

Kay:

Did you receive the signature pages I sent by fax?  The quickest way to get 
original signatures from me is to send the originals electronically.  I will 
print out the signature pages and send them back to you by express mail (2 
days from here).

Thanks,
Brett

Hi there, and happy new year.

I have a stack of turbine contracts which were waiting for signature.  I 
believe the override letter needed signing as well.  Should I send the 
unsigned originals somewhere?

Thanks,

Kay
