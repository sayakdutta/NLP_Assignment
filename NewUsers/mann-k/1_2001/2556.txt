Herman and I will see you at 10:00am tomorrow to discuss accounting issues 
related to our power plant development and sale activities.

Our presentation will be based upon the following attachment.  

Hard copies will be available tomorrow in 38C2.

Regards.

Could you check with David and see if he could fax copies of the PowerPoint 
plates to me in Portland so we have a fighting chance of following along by 
tying in by phone?    If that is possible, try to send them by Tuesday. Thank 
you very much.
