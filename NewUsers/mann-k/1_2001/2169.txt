In addition to Doug's comments regarding the Amendment, the second
sentence of Section 2 of the Original Agreement which is in quotation
marks in paragarah 1 of your draft of the Amendment should be revised in
the following respects:

1)  The outside closing date of "January 15, 2001" should be changed to
"January 22, 2001" to give sufficient time for the Facility Agreement to
be signed after the funding of the escrow; and

2)  The reference to "the Original Agreement" should be to "this
Agreement" since this sentence is being inserted in the Original
Agreement.
