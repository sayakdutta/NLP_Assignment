Gentlemen,

I think we also need to be certain that we have a decent amount of discretion 
in whether we close, otherwise we have to consider the DASH process at this 
time.

From a commercial perspective, I don't have a problem leaving out the 
exercise price during the 30 day option period, so long as our obligation to 
sell is contingent upon the negotiation of a purchase agreement and the 
agreement on purchase price. $300k seems fair for a 30 day exclusivity.

Regards,

Ben
