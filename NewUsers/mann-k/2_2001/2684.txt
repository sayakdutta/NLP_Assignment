Karen,

It appears to  me that revisions were made to this agreement, and the 
agreement was presented to the counterparty for signature without me being 
consulted.  Perhaps you did email this to me and I can't locate the electonic 
file.  In any event, in the future, please call me on the telephone  BEFORE 
revisions are made to documents and presented to the counterparty.  If you 
can't reach me by phone, send me an explanatory email. Also, please email me 
redlines against prior drafts.  This will faciliate my review.  Faxing drafts 
does not work for me. 

I will send you the required changes tomorrow.

Thank you,

Kay
