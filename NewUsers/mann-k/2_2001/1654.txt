Poor baby!  At least it is only twice a year, or in her case, this one last 
time.

I think I may take him fishing with my dad and mom in Palacios.  He really 
loves it, and my dad is in declining  health, but can still get around.  I 
hate to waste the opportunitty to let them spend time together.

That's what I was thinking too!  Let me check calendars and send out an email 
regarding same.

Did you find something for you and Michael to do on spring break?  Ruthie is 
STILL in heat!  Bless her heart, she's been bleeding 13 days!

Maybe we should have the GE call on Thursday, or maybe Friday am.
