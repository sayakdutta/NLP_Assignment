I'm getting hourly updates.  I haven't talked to John today.  Carlos tell you 
about the security guard by HR?


   
	
	
		



Debbie went to Paper.  And I was wondering why Reagan has been "full of 
himself" lately.

Carlos filled me in on the stuff "over yonder".  My, My, My.

Scooped me on Ray.  I like him.

I heard Debbie Chance is transferring to another group, and that Reagan is 
going to be an originator (not a developer).


   
	
	
		



that Ray Hoppe is leaving (if not already gone)?  Think he is going to Duke.
