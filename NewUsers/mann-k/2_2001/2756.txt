Hi Randy,

Here's what you missed.

My personal preference is to not spend the money to check out the licensing 
issues at this point since I don't have the outside counsel doing anything 
now.  When John called me last week and asked the question I gave him that 
opinion, and I had assumed that it had been communicated to you.  Sorry about 
that!

Hi there,

I'm forwarding a draft EPC contract for your review.  This form of contract 
assumes that the equipment will be procurred by the Owner, with the 
understanding that we have not resolved the issue of the timing of the 
procurement of the equipment, and  how it will be procurred.

This is intended to be a discussion draft, and is subject to further Enron 
review and comment.  

Thanks,

Kay
