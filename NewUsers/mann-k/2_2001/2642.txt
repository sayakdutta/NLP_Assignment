By the way, I was talking to my friend and colleague Rose, and she tells me 
that the company has hired a car to take Rose, another person and me home on 
Thursday after the big party.  Nice touch, huh?  We all live close to each 
other.

I'm going there in April! Would you and Michael like to join me?  





Go to DisneyWorld?

Just kidding.

I don't know.  Maybe order some clothes.
