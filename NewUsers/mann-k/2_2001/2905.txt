Westinghouse has agreed that LJM doesn't need to sign it.  I sent SW a letter 
confirming that agreement.  Lynn tells me that they should sign it soon.  
Otherwise, the agreement is fully executed.

Kay,

What is the status of the Westinghouse settlement letter?  I thought that it 
had been fully executed but Mitch Robinson indicated that he thought that LJM 
still needed to sign.  In any case, Allegheny Energy's attorney has requested 
a copy of the letter that Westinghouse was obligated to send (regarding our 
ability to increase the maximum output at the Wheatland facility without 
affecting the warranties) pursuant to paragraph 3 of the letter.  Please 
advise ASAP.
