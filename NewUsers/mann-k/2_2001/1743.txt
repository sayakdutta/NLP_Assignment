It is just too far out of your way.  I'll try to see if I can catch a ride 
somewhere.

Wow! If it's a limo don't tell Michael... So, I guess you would like a ride
to work on Thursday? I'm sure we can do that. NM





By the way, I was talking to my friend and colleague Rose, and she tells me
that the company has hired a car to take Rose, another person and me home
on Thursday after the big party.  Nice touch, huh?  We all live close to
each other.

I'm going there in April! Would you and Michael like to join me?





Go to DisneyWorld?

Just kidding.

I don't know.  Maybe order some clothes.
