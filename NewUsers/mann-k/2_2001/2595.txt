I'm in NYC, returning tomorrow.  Neil hasn't mentioned Mac calling, but I 
really didn't think we would hear from him again before today.

We meant to leave the stereo - hope you don't mind.  Paige got a new one for 
Christmas, and her old one seemed perfect for the Pink House.  

We enjoyed our visit also.  Thanks for everything.

Sorry to hear about the girls.  Tis the season.  I hope Lisa has a nice 
birthday tomorrow, even with sick kids.

Gotta go meet someone.

Love,

Kay







HiKay Kay. Just a short note since we are not sure if you are in Houston.
We sure found alot of goodies when we got here. The music center is great.
Did you intend to leave it here ? We REALLY enjoyed your,Michael and
Roscoe's short visit. Lisa sent an email yesterday saying the girls were
sick. Annie had 102 fever. Have you heard from Mac lately? Love to
all.Mother
