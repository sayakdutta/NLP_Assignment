Good morning,

Just checking in.  Michael and I had a good morning.  No weird outfits 
today.  Figures, since I now have a camera ready to go.

So what do you think about the stone thing? I like the way Bob's front yard 
looks. 

I'm not sore today, but then again, I didn't do all that much.  Our yard is 
looking better, though.

Hope you are having a good day.

Love,
