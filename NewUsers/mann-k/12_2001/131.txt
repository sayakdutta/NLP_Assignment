That's fine.




Kay:

I didn't get a chance to send the letter out today, but will do so tomorrow. Is it OK for me to send it out to AES without your initials, but with you intialing the copy we retain for our records? In the past, we typically provided payment direction to AES by e-mail.

Let me know.


Cc:	Schneider, Chip; Zisman, Stuart; Mann, Kay

Thanks Dave. We'll send the letter out today.
Regards,
