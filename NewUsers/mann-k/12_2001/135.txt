Stuart had a suggested change.  I'll email it to you.

 

Is this letter approved to go out today?  Please advise.

Probably until 6.

 

I have a copy of the lease to give to you.  How long are you going to be in your office?

It would be helpful to see the lease and the letter before commenting.

Thanks,

Kay

 

Please provide me with any comments to the letter.  I can work with Lorie to get it revised and send it out once we receive a consensus.
