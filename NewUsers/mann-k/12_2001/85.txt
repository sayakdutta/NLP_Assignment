I think it would be a good idea to have the files copied.

I have my files (that I borrowed from Carlos' office the other day) here with me.  For what it is worth, I review Ben's letter and changed it to comport with the requirements of the agreement.  Would it be easier for me to send you copies or do you need both binders?

 

Do you have the Haywood file that was in Carlos' office?  I need it or a copy of it.  

Thanks,

Kay
