Will you modify the opinions you have to include this language?

Thanks,

Kay,

This is the language generally offered by Mr. Derrick with respect to the '40 Act.  Please call if you have any questions.

Enron is not an "investment company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.
