Wilson,

Good morning.  What is your availability this week for a conference call with 
David?

Thanks,

I will be out of the office on Monday,but am available the rest of the week
for a conference call, except from 2:30 - 3:00 on Wednesday.




Gentlemen,

Could we schedule some time for a conference call next week?  I would
appreciate the opportunity to work through some of the legal issues.  I
have the lofty goal of not working Memorial Day weekend this year, so I'm
trying to get as much done on this deal as soon as possible.

Thanks,

Kay

PS.  I'm open Tues am and most of Wednesday.  I can probably work my
schedule so that I'm available quite a bit of next week.
