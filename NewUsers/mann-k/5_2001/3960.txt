I sent this email from GE to Dale/Bill after I received it.  Since Peter's 
last draft was April 24, I'm I assume this wasn't included:





Kay/Bill,

Bill says he agrees and accepts our comments to the A&A.

One change required to the Rev 5 document.  In Exhibit B, Add item "27)One
additional Human Machine Interface (HMI) per Unit (desktop PC type)"

Include these changes and we can get this done tomorrow.

Thanks,

Lee
