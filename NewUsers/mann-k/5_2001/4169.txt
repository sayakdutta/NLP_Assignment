Yes.  How about this afternoon, 3:45 or 4:00.  I just got an email from my 
daughter, begging to come home for a month or so (it breaks my heart because 
I remember how lonely I was when I was pregnant in Louisiana).

Of course not.  We really are only going to put the: (i) development 
documents (except the lease) and (ii) other publically available documents on 
deal bench (i.e. Interconnect Agreements, Feasibility Studies, etc.).

I only wanted you to have a heads up on what we had already provided TECO.  
Better to know was what I was thinking (even if it is after the fact).
