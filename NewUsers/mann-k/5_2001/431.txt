Business casual is the order of the day here.  Ties are definitely not 
necessary.

Are you spending the night downtown?  If so, you may want to just park at the 
hotel.  Lots of the streets downtown are under construction, so I'm a little 
hesitant to give directions.  Enron is located fairly close to the Hyatt, and 
their garage is easy to find.  Enron just opened a new parking garage, but 
I'm not sure if it is open for visitors yet.  Alternatively,  the Allen 
Center Garage is connected to the Enron building via an above-street walkway.

If it was me and I was working and staying downtown, I would take a taxi.  
This is partly because I have an under-developed sense of direction, and 
partly because of the construction downtown.

Hope this helps.

My flight is scheduled to arrive at Hobby at 7:45 am, and I plan to rent a 
car. I assume I can get downtown by 9 to 9:30. Would that be OK? I assume we 
can finish our business within an hour. 

Any special instructions on where to go in your building? Also, if my other 
business does not require a coat and tie, does your office observe business 
casual dress like so many others?
