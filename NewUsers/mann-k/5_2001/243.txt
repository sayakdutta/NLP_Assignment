Way cool.  I'd let Reagan follow up.

Reagan has not received the CA, but has a call in to the Developer regarding 
the status.  I will be happy to call Doug Pedigo if you want me to.

Also, the InterGen office that Raimund is working with is in Florida (Miami).

 

Hi.

Did the CA get signed and sent, and did it come back?

Thanks,

Kay
