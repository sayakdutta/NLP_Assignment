Lee,

I'll rev up the Austin facility agreement again.  Eric tells me that we are=
=20
fine with adding the additional TD of I to the facility agreement with a=20
scope/price change.

Ignore the insurance certificate question.  My bad.

I've heard that the LOC made it, so GE should be receiving payment in full=
=20
today. =20

LV Co Gen is still moving.  There are some of the TurboPark stuff which was=
=20
in the agreed form of override letter.  It is being actively worked right n=
ow.

Sorry about your trip.

Kay







Kay,

I don't know the answer to your 1st question since I don't recall ever
having to have insurance certificates on any of the other Facility
Agreements.  Maybe we did, but I just forgot that detail.  Jaap/Kent? do yo=
u
know?

The Retention LC was faxed this am to Greg Lang and Isabell Parker.  Jaap's
Admin Asst can fax you a copy (Carla Corly) if you wish.

Also, need to talk about Austin Tech reps being added to Facility Agreement
asap (Mike Storm says they've worked out 1700 hours with Eric Booth).  But
we need something in the interim that confirms this will be added into the
Austin Facility Agreement (e-mail to me OK).

Regards,

Lee


(PS, GE AEP)



Good morning.

I haven't seen the insurance certificate she references.  Anyone know where
it is?

Is the retention letter of credit available yet? I know it has been
requested, but I don't recall seeing that it has been delivered.

Thanks for everything,

Kay
