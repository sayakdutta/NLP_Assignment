Nothing better than a FREE trip to SF.  Where will you stay?




Well, just let me know so I can put it on my calendar.  You are all set with 
my vacation days on your calendar.  This SF trip is going to be fun!  We are 
going to be wined and dined by a vendor from Tidal Software.  Ric helped him 
get $12M in funding, so he's showing his appreciation.  I think Ric would 
like to go to work for this company if he could get a package from Compaq.  I 
don't think they'll let him go though.

Probably the week of July 4th.




I have to write it on my calendar too or I won't remember.  When are you 
going to take some vacation.  I'm sure you need a break!
