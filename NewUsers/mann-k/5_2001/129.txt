Hi Greg,

I just wanted to mention that if we are going to bust the percentage rule on 
the option payment, there is no incremental damage in having the option 
payment credited to the purchase price of the land.

As for officers of the development company, I would use Dave Duran.  Ben 
holds a power of attorney, but isn't an officer.

Hope you get email!

Kay
