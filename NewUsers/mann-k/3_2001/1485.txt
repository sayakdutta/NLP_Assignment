I did write it for them, and sent it to Lynn.  We are waiting for them to 
sign it and send it back.

Sometimes the best way to get SW moving is to do the work for them.  We might 
want to draft a proposed letter to get the ball rolling.  I would suggest 
getting Allegheny to buy off on it.

Lynn Dekrey is the guy Mitch negotiated the deal with.  Lynn left me a 
message on Monday and said he didn't see a problem, but he didn't give me a 
day we could expect the letter.  I would expect it this week.

Who is Lynn and when can we expect the follow up letter (i.e. the one that 
expressly permits an increase in output at the Wheatland Plant)?
