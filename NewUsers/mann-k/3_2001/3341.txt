I came in too late to know whether it was offered or asked for, but yes, it 
is a deliverable.  The Delta deal is being financed, so they are asking for a 
lot of docs, including a letter from GE counsel.  

To make it more fun, there are complications with the GE consent on the 
Pastoria deal.  It is not a happy time between GE and Enron, but I hope it 
will smooth over quickly.

More to come.

PS.  Still no comments from NorthWestern. We need to talk about how 
scheduling problems Easter weekend if this thing drags on.

Kay:

Since NorthWestern and Delta are using Paul Hastings, I'm concerned about 
NorthWestern asking for an acknowledgement letter as we provided to Intergen. 
Have we offered to provide an acknowledgement letter to Delta on the LM6000s?

Regards,

Ben
