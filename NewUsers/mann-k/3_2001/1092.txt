Gentlemen:

Enclosed are clean and marked copies of the revised draft of the letter
agreement between ENA and DAL.  The blacklined copy is marked to reflect
revisions from the prior draft dated March 16, 2001.  In the interest of
time, the revised letter agreement is being circulated prior to review by
our client, and is therefore subject to further comment from ENA.  If you
have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to contact me.  Thank
you.
