I kinda like Coyote LLC and Black Hills LLC (no spruce).


   
	
	
		



Rushmore LLC (Mt Rushmore)
Rose Quartz LLC (State mineral)
Humming Bee LLC (State insect)
Coyote LLC (University of SD mascot)
Black Hills Spruce LLC (State tree)
Walleye LLC (State Fish)

This is already more than I ever wanted to know about SD.

We need a name for the LLC for this transaction.  Any suggestions?
