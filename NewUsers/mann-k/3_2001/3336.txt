 Attached please find a clean copy of the Salmon Energy Turbine
Agreement (the second document below), which includes Lee Johnson's
proposed changes to Section 10.7, as well as a blackline (first document
below) showing changes to the (3/27) version you forwarded earlier
today. I have include notes within the agreement indicationg those
places where questions remain - e.g., how the addition of the new
turbine affects the pricing schedule, guaranteed delivery, etc.
