They haven't signed the other ones.  We moved the equipment straight out of 
TurboPark and into the llc, then on the same day sold down the equity of the 
llc.

Please call to discuss at your convenience.

Thanks,

When you got the other breakout contracts signed by Wilmington Trust, to whom 
did you send them?

I need to get the LV contract fully signed up now.

Please let me know.  

I'm sorry I missed seeing you last week.
