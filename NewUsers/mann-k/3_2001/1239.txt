Don't be too grateful.  I think Jake wants you to weigh in no matter what.  
He obviously values your opinion.

My personal opinion is you put the comments in front of Lee, and if he 
doesn't like them, the answer to Delta is no, we have no leverage to get your 
changes.

It would be great if you could.  I'm trying to get an EPC contract signed 
right now.

Thanks.

Jake is ready to tell Lee who the purchaser is and get permission to "tell 
all".  I think that's a good way to go.

I have to confess that I didn't look at their comments to the turbine 
contract.  I will be glad to do it if you want.  Jake said that Bill Williams 
had some discussions with Delta, and he thought maybe some of their comments 
were no longer germane.  Bill has received their comments, but I don't know 
his reaction.

Jake is trying to chase me down to see if some proposed changes Delta wants 
to negotiate with GE look to be in the realm of reason.  Have you seen the 
comments?

Second:  In redacting the liability caps, etc. did you have a discussion with 
Lee Johnson about GE sensitivities?  Delta is expressing a need to see what 
the caps are.

Your thoughts?
