Yes, but this time it is his carotid artery - the one that transports blood 
to the brain.  Big deal kinda stuff.


   
	
	
		



I hope your dad's surgery goes well!  Is this related to the problems he is 
having getting around (circulatory?)?

I have a change in plans next week.  My dad is having surgery in Ft. Worth, 
so I will be heading that way on Monday.  I was planning to be on vacation 
anyway, but I may have some accessibility challenges in Ft. Worth which I 
would not have had otherwise.  I will manage client expectations accordingly.
