Questions which arose during my discussions with Sue Garven today concerning 
the turbine performance and associated warranty and TAA issues.

We may be able to change to 9:00 if that works for Brad and Laine as well.

Rob,

9:00am CST would work better for me, but I could adjust my schedule if 
necessary.  What is the topic of discussion.
