For once I remembered.   Hope you have a good one and all is going well.  It 
was nice to see ya'll at Christmas.  Tell Terry that Mom and Laurie loved the 
trunks.  I was quite happy with the A&M cardholder as well so let Jason and 
Erin know for me.  Too bad the Aggie lost that wild one in Shreveport (could 
you believe that snow).  Conrats again on your appointment to the board of 
the KofC.  Hope 2001 is a superb year for you.

Regards,

Rob
