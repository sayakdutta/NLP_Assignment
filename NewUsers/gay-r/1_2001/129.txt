Rick,

In preparation for the meeting with the lenders on Tuesday I was reviewing 
the GSA and I wonder if YPF has any force majeure claims which could impede 
our rights to terminate.  I know they indicated at least verbally that they 
had encountered some problems in Argentina.  Although a stretch has Dean or 
Novak indicated that this could be a defense?
