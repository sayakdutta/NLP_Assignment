I hope I can get to this today.






Rob,

I'm sorry to bother you again. I just decided to add Yale to my list in order 
to get more chance. Would you mind to write me another recommendation letter? 
Yale asks you to describe specific activities or accomplishments which can 
demonstrate my strength and weakness in a separate page in addition to the 
ranking. I think this will demand more of your time to give some examples. I 
can think of the examples for you if you need. 

I would appreciate if you can take more time to write me this last 
recommendation letter.

Maggie
