Thank you for the refund.  I am still hopeful you will be able to find the 
card.  Its a fine piece of history.

Regards,

Rob








We have a trace running on the package which could take a long time with the 
Post Office. We sent you back a refund yesterday. If we can locate your item 
or another one that is similar we will be sure to let you know.
