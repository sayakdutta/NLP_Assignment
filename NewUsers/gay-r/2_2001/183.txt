On Friday we distributed  RFPs for securing bridge gas.   Letters went today 
to Chaco, TotalfinaElf, Andina, Maxus, BritishGas and Petrobras for them to 
quote us 6-month gas with our option to extend for another 6 months.  We have 
given them until March 2nd to respond.

Pete Weidler will meet with YPF (hopefully with Ernesto Lopez Anad?n) the 
week of the 19th.
