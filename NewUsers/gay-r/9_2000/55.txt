I think we are on the right track from our meeting yesterday.  I talked to 
Patti today and she is confirming the way we want to do things from a users 
perspective.  My thought is that we get a good, general, working model as to 
how the information will flow, then take it back to our groups and go over 
different scenarios within each region, such as Opal Plant, Socal, etc.  We 
can see how the information will flow and see what we need to tinker with.

I also have a few questions we need to think about at some point, and I did 
not want to forget them.  

1.  When we make a change to an existing upstream/downstream contract, how 
will we notify the counterparties that a change has occurred.  

2.  Should we lock out our customer's at some time so they can't make changes 
at a late time?  We could do the rest over the phone.

3.  On EDI pipes, we could conceivably make changes up to 11:45 am, but it 
would affect customers whose noms are due at 11:30.  

I thought these were just questions we might want to think about.  I'm sure 
there are a lot of others.

Thanks.
