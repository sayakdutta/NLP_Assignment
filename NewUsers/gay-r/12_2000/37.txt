 I discussed the issue with S&W and they agreed with our approach.  They ask 
that we formalize the process.  Should the attached letter be sent to the 
banks or to S&W?  Pls let me know as we need to get this issue resolved.

 I spoke with Brad and Sue of Stone and Webster about this issue.  They don't 
have a problem with what we are proposing to do.  Pls work up a paper on the 
issue so we can send it to the banks formally.

As far as I'm concerned this is fine if that is the deal.  However, I would
suggest that Owner obtain the Lenders' agreement to the position as it
constitutes a change to the Performance Tests under the EPC Contract.  See
Section 8.12(b)(ii)(D) of the Common Terms Agreement.

Laine,

This letter could be titled "Suggested Carve Out Language for Gatwick
Accord.  This is a response to your request for Language which we would
want to see in order  to go ahead and execute the Gatwick Accord.  Our main
issue results from our not wanting to be reposition the By-Pass Damper
after we finish Combined Cycle Oil Commissioning.

We structured this letter as a stand alone letter agreement so that we do
not need to wait until the EOT claim is executed to sign the Gatwick Accord
nor would we need to change the current language in the Gatwick Accord.

     What is the logic for the Gatwick carve out being in this letter?
Should it be a stand alone issue?  Not upset or excited in the least just
curious.
