Nancy informed me that you were not happy because certain provisions/deals
discussed on the business side were not accurately reflected in the finance
agreements, which is creating additional legal expenses.  I assume you are
referring to a recent draft of the ECA in which the fall away provisions
that we discussed were not accurately reflected in the agreement.  This is
my fault - in the interest of trying to expedite getting the draft to the
sponsors, I authorized Melissa to send the draft out without reviewing the
provisions first.  Normally, KfW and OPIC review the agreements before
sending to you and our lawyers make the required changes before you see the
agreement.  I will no longer authorize her to send anything to the sponsors
before KfW and OPIC review the contents in full.  Hopefully - this will help
prevent this situation from occuring in the future.

Sorry for the inconvenience this caused the sponsors.

Mary
