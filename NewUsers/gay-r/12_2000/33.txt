The lenders have declined to meet with us at this time.  They have suggested 
the following instead:

1) Send the Lenders and S&W the new budget info and the revised change order 
summary.

2) Revise the model to reflect the new costs and the new timeline.

3) S&W will review the model and then we will repeat the exercise of 
calculating fuel oil and Furnas penalty exposures.

4) Finalize sponsor support elements.

Theoretically the lenders can take 30 days to review the model and budget 
when submitted.

We will arrange an ECA call for Thursday or Friday.
