Way to go Keith.  You should be very proud of what you accomplished here and 
I think the vision of what you set out to do continues.  Best of luck in the 
future.

Team:

It is with much pleasure and gratitude that I confirm AES' stepping up to 
purchase our remaining interest in the Barge project located in Lagos, 
Nigeria.  Thanks to the dedication and hard work of everyone, we were able to 
create a robust and compelling project in spite of numerous detractors and 
doubters.  This latest development only reinforces the value of your efforts.

Please note that we still have interests in Nigeria (notably an EPC contract 
for the Barges) and we remain engaged in a strategic alliance with AES and YF 
Power to ensure the successful evacuation of power to all Nigerians via the 
Barge project and the IPP as quickly as possible.  Notwithstanding this sale, 
we remain committed to this endeavor and believe that the alliance is the 
most expedient vehicle to the realization of everyone's goals.   If you 
happen to have discussions with outsiders regarding these projects, please do 
your part to quell the notion that Enron has "abandoned" the project.  Feel 
free to talk to me regarding any questions you may have.

Thanks again and congratulations on a job well done.

Keith
