Hey guys:  just to follow up after our discussion this morning on unfinaled 
invoices, the following will be our procedures.

10th day of month:  invoices sent out
1st business day after 10th:  we will get the unfinaled invoice report from 
settlements and start working on clearing all discrepancies.  We will have 
all discrepancies cleared by the 5th work day after the 10th.
25th day of month:  purchase stuff goes out.
1st work day after 25th:  unfinaled invoice report from settlements, same 
timetable to clear all discrepancies.

Remember:  a discrepancy will consist of anything that could hold an invoice 
from going out the door.  
We need to be very receptive to other groups in helping them clear these up.  
We know more about these deals than anyone, so let's be helpful.
Let's also try to clear these up in a way so as to avoid causing these 
problems in the future, if we can.  

Thanks in advance for everyone's help.
