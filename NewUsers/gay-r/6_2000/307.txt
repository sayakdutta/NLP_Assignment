Jana:  I would definitely like to have an analyst start as soon as possible.  
Let me know what the procedure is (i.e. do I interview, will an anlyst just 
be assigned to me, etc.)  I had already talked to Mason Hamlin before, and he 
opted for another rotation, although he was perffectly acceptable to me.  So 
let me know what I need to do and when I could expect an analyst.  Also, a 
new hire analyst is acceptable.  Thanks.
