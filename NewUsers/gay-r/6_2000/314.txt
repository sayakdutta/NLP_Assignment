   Randy, 

   Please confirm by forwarding this email to Veronica Thompson in Accounts 
Payable...

   That you agree Patti Sullivan did not go as planned to Colorado Springs 
and should be reimbursed the 
   amount of $242.17 for those charges that were billed to her American 
Express.  

    Thank you, 
    Heather Choate, x33278
