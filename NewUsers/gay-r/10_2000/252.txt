Stacy Dickson called, and she said penalties for non-performance in the past 
have been handled by supplying information to Legal and they will then write 
a letter to the counterparty stating that per the contract you were supposed 
to deliver X but you didn't perform, so now you owe us $Y.  I asked her what 
she would need to do this and she gave me the following list of items.  
Please coordinate getting this to her - the spreadsheet you prepared may 
already have the volume comparison, prices, and penalty calc in it - we just 
need to get copies of the confirms and contracts.  Let me know if you have 
any questions.  Thanks.
