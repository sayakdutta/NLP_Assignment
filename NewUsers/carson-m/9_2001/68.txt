#1 These guys can't even trade on EOL because they don't have an EEI in place with us.  #2 ,,,all the legs of cal02 are out there.  Tell them to add them all up, and divide by 12.

Mike,

An inquiring customer ...
If you want me to call Brent I'll be happy to. 
Let me know if you want to share your reasons for pulling J-D02..

Thanks. ...T




Teresa, I have noticed that the Entergy Jan-Dec02 contract has not shown up
on EOL since 9/4.  Is this because no one is trading it anymore, and have
lost interest? 


Thanks,
