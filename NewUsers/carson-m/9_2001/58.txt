Hey - Cat Fans
 
Only 5 days until the first game and the first  watch party of the year for the KSU Wildcats!   An event that we all  have been eagerly awaiting!  
 
Good luck to all of you that are going to  California.  Bring back a victory!  For those of us staying here in  soggy Texas, don't forget to come to the SRO in the Northwest Mall at 5:30 this  coming Saturday to watch the game!!  Northwest is located at the  intersection of the Highway 290 and 610 Loop West.  The SRO opens directly  into the parking lot facing north.  Check our web site for more information  houalum.zk-state.com.  As we have said  before,  this new SRO has outstanding new televisions and a great sound  system.  The whole place is new and quite spiffy.  However, they still  have the same outstanding hamburgers!  
 
Our new Houston Alumni Club polo shirts are in and will be on  sale Saturday.  Price is $35.00 and these shirts are really sharp!   Purple of course, with black collar and cuffs with a white stripe.    Shirts are perfect for casual business wear and you can boast about Kansas State  at the same time!  We have a limited amount so come early to get your  shirt!  We have ordered new purple tee shirts but have not yet received  them.  They should be here by Saturday and the price will be  $15.00.
 
SEE YOU SATURDAY!  GO CATS!
