RIBFEST IV

Mike Paradise produced an unparalleled performance last year managing to=20
dominate the lowest ranking of all the contestants by a considerable margin=
=20
for the second year in a row!  Additionally, the judges showed tremendous=

wisdom picking the winner.  However, the nagging question remains; how good=

does the perfect rib taste?  Thus, as the artist must pursue beauty, the=20
fourth annual celebration of the Baby Back Rib must take place.

This event involves many of the things you need for a perfect weekend day:=

eating a lot of ribs, imbibing libations, enjoying an autumn day, and=20
watching some football.  This year, the contestants will be cooking an absu=

amount of ribs, allowing the crowd to voice their opinion on the "people's=
