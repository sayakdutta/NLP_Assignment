HELLO  FOOTBALL!!
 
All of us folks in Houston may not realize it, but fall is  almost here!  And what does that mean?  Football!! Football!! and More  Football!!   KSU is ranked high again this year so let's get out to  our Watch Parties to cheer the team on!  First Watch Party is on Saturday, September 8, at 5:30 pm  when KSU defeats the mighty USC team.  Where are the Watch Parties?  At the new  SRO in Northwest Mall at 290 and 610 West intersection.  It's a great new  location with wonderful tv's and sound.  If you can't go to California for  the game, this is the next best thing!  We have a great time!  New  shirts for sale!  Other surprises!  GO CATS!
