It looks like they may be wavering a bit.  The only catch is that the redir=
ect must be done 2 days ahead of time..  Also, there must be firm transmiss=
ion available on the redirected path.  Currently, in the short term at leas=
t, there is no firm transmission to any place of value,,,,ie SOCO, AMRN, TV=
A.  Entergy is still, unfortunately, LONG JAIL...
If you guys read this notice any different, please let me know.

Does this mean Ent is wavering on the firm point-to-point argument?  maybe =
pressure being felt through the RTO process?
