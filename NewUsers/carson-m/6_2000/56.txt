Just got your voice mail at the house this wk end.... We have just moved into 
our house and had not checked that # for a couple days.......  I had wondered 
why I never got a reply from you on the e-mails I sent......  I guess we know 
now!

Update...... if you did'nt already know ,,,, Heather and I are having a baby 
boy due in October.... We are both very excited!!!!!   

Got to go....stay in touch
