I have a trip to Portland scheduled for the 2nd and 3rd. What about the week 
of the 6th? The 6th, 7th, and 8th are especially good.

Our friend Jane called this morning and left the following message:

"David Paulker apologizes for cancelling yesterday.  They are all available on
11/2 or 11/3 at 9:30 am."

I can't do it on the 3rd, but I can do it on the 2d.  What do your schedules
look like?  Thanks.
