I am not a big Soussan fan. Zimmerman would be best.

I went to the Courthouse today for the Vinmar hearing on the motion to compel 
and for sanctions related to the traders tapes.  Before the start of the 
hearing, we met outside the courtroom with Vinmar's lawyers.  They apparently 
finally came to the conclusion that the arbitration agreement covers this 
discovery dispute, and, after some discussion, they agreed to pass the 
hearing.  We will work with them to select a mutually agreeable arbitrator 
this week, if possible, and they can have this issue heard before the 
arbitrator.  This morning they mentioned three former judges as potential 
arbitrators: Ruby Sondock, Alvin Zimmerman, and Susan Soussan, although I 
think their preference out of those three would be Alvin Zimmerman.  He would 
also be my preference out of those choices.  They may send us other names 
that they would consider using as an arbitrator, but, in the meantime, let me 
know what you think about these three.  Thanks.
