Here is an email I received from the Susman Godfrey firm about their
interest in representing the Participants Committee in the commandeering
matter.

Howard,

My partner Steve Susman forwarded me a copy of your email to him.  Our firm
looks forward to meeting with your committee on Wednesday.  While I had
planned to attend when the interview was scheduled for last Thursday, I
cannot come this week because I am starting trial in Chicago.  I am not sure
yet who from our firm will be attending, but can assure you that we are very
interested in the case.  Whether by ourselves or jointly with Marshall
Grossman and his firm, we think this sort of lawsuit is right up our alley.
We know how to get a complex commercial dispute ready for trial, maximize
its settlement value, or try it successfully if necessary.

I'll try to give you a call Monday or Tuesday to let you know who else from
our firm will be joining Marc Seltzer, who heads our LA office, at the
interview.  You can reach me at 713-653-7827 if you wish.

By the way, there is considerable information about our firm and its lawyers
at our web site, www.susmangodfrey.com

Thanks, Howard.  I look forward to speaking with you.
