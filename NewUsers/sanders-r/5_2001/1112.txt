I have spoken with Marshall Grossman of Alshuler Grossman Stein & Kahan LLP.  
He is interested.


Please forward to Alan Yudkowsky, Richard Sanders, Pat Mar and me your
suggestions for proposed counsel to handle the commandeering litigation.  I
would like to schedule a Committee meeting to consider the candidates as
soon as possible after the Court approves the Stipulation at the May 17
hearing.

Thanks.
