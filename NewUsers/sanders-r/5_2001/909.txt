Call Guidry. Bruce is probably relieved he doesn't have to complete another form. I also left you a VM on the propsed McCartney trip. I need you to coordinate through Stephanie so we can get the dates set in stone.






I haven't completed any of mine.  Our understanding down here is that we got an extension.  Do you mean call Guidry or Lundstrom?  Do I need to do something on line?

 

I have done it but not until this morning. You may want to call him. Also-Novack and Williams have not completed reviews.








Hey Richard-I'm just following up to tell you that I want to take Bruce Lundstrom off my review list and ass John Guidry who is a client, since Bruce is already on the PRC anyway. How do I do that?
 
Regards, 
Michelle
