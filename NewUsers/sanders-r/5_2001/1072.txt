As you might recall, I have been given the lead on the volumetric production
payment issue in the Wright case in general, and in dealing with EOG in
particular.

As you know, I have heard the long story from EOG.   You suggested that the
next time I was in Houston that we try to meet with Julia Heintz Murray to
get the more to point version from the ECT / Enron perspective.

I will be in town next week for the "measurement summit."  I could come
earlier, stay later, or carve out some time during to talk to Julia.  This
might be a good introduction for Andy as well.  (Of course, Barrett is also
included if his schedule permits.)

From the viewpoint of my schedule, I would suggest Thursday afternoon,
Tuesday afternoon, or Friday morning, in approximate order of preference.
Let me know.
