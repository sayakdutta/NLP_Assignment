I am writing for your approval to enter into an agreement on behalf of Enron
and the Enron outside counsel to enable all of us to have access to the
joint work product website for the Gordon Hendricks group.  The Website will
have the following information:

Event Calendar
Docket and pleadings for Electricity Litigation around the West
Pleadings in the major cases we are all in
Repository for all working drafts of documents
Repository for letters that are now circulated as attachments

In the future, some defendants may use this system for actual document
productions to government agencies etc.

As I see it, we really have not choice but to join this system if we are
going to participate in the joint defense group.  Shortly they will stop
circulating work product etc. via email and will rely upon this website
instead.

The costs are somewhat unclear but it is intended to be an economy of scale
cost sharing concept.

They cannot start the program until we all sign up and so they are asking
for a quick response.

Thanks
Gary
