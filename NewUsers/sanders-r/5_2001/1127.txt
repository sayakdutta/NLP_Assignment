Thanks for your quick response. I have relayed this information to my friend 
and am waiting.

Regarding your friends who have the working interest in the Bowen #1 and #2 
wells in Panola County, I've had the gas contracts system checked and  
Houston Pipe Line Company does not purchase gas from Hydrocarbon Lease 
Management in that county.  The only county in which HPL purchases gas from 
HLM is a well in Matagorda County.  There are no records of gas purchases 
from any well called Bowen #1 or Bowen #2.   If they have well meter numbers, 
we can run a check that way but it doesn't look like HPL is the gas purchaser.
