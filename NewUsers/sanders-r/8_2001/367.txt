Sounds Fine


Cc: Weidler, Peter E


We should waive this.  I waived a similar conflict for Guido last year. He represents us in the Stamp Tax case in Argentina and frequently represents the Bolivian govt. We'd rather have someone we know is a good lawyer and objective than someone we don't know.   FYI, Guido wrote the Supreme Decree that enabled Transredes to get its deferred account back.
 



Dear Michelle, 

The Superintendencia General del SIRESE (Bolivia) just send me the background of the Transredes case in which they are requesting my advise. 

It is an administrative appeal before said agency of resolutions SSDH Nbr. 0257/2000 and 0014/2001 concerning the assesment of a fine of 710.000 bolivianos due to an oil spill and the rejection of the appeal filed before the Hidrocarbons Agency.  

As mentioned in our conference call, I informed the Superintendencia General about my assistance to Enron in different matters and they expressed no concern about the independence of my advise nor potential conflicts of interest. Please be kind enough to confirm me that Enron acknowledges that no conflict of interest arises of my eventual assistance to the Superintendencia General cocerning this matter and, therefore, that it has no objection in order for me to provide such assistance.

Best regards, 

Guido Santiago Tawil
