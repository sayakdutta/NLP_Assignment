Richard,

I spoke to Paul Heath and he said the bankruptcy code tolls the running of
limitations, so long as time to file had not run prior to the filing of the
bankruptcy petition.  The code provides for a new, two-year limitations
period from the time the petition in bankruptcy is filed.  From our
conversation, it sounds like that was filed on 9/4/99, and we will then
expect to see Ben's suit filed by 9/4/01.

The attached is my summary of what I perceived as the key bullet points from
Grella's testimony with some page references.  I hope it's useful.

Regards,
Dan
