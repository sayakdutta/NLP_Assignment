FYI. This meeting has to do with the Calpers "investigation" of its JEDI investment with Enron. As you know, Willie Brown is the mayor of SF. The city of SF is the lead plaintiff in one of the class actions.
 

Ken Lay and Andy Fastow are meeting with Willie Brown and another rep from his office and the CIO and CEO of CalPERS on Monday August 6th at 1 pm in New York.
