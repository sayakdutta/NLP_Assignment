Richard, I have had a request from Denise LaGesse (at Lou's request) to remove the Enron Litigation Unit charges on this matter from their operating company (ETS) and charge them to ENA instead.  We have billed ETS 5 times since January, the total amount of the billings being $4,678.47.  If you are in agreement with this transfer of charges, please provide the company # and cost center # that you would like me to have them transferred to.  I can forward details of these billings to you by fax or mail.  Let me know your preference.  Thank you.
 
Denise, I will need your company # and cost center # as well.
 
Thank you.
