If possible, don't sign a lease until I get back. If you need a immediate answer, let me know.

Mike,

I understand that you will be signing the lease for the repository.
Attached please find (1) the lease, (2) attachment A to the lease, and (3)
an outstanding invoice.

Please note, I spoke with Tracy Wilson today at the Capitol Mall Executive
Center.  She is expecting early next week the signed lease as well as the
rent payment reflected in the invoice.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Peter Meringolo
