The Perd is a problem because it cost $10,000 per year to maintain. I guess 
Mom is (justifiably) tired of paying this when it has been used twice in six 
months. There is really nothing more to it than that. When we1) all get a 
little older and our kids can play unsupervised,2) are less busy and3) have 
our spiritual leader back in the land of the round eye, then we will use it 
alot more. No one is seriosly considering selling the joint, save 
Yvonne.                                                                       
                              

I can probably take off two weeks in August next year to do something stupid 
w/ you. July and June are bad because Julie will be in Montissori training 
school in Austin. We should do something bold, exciting--not Colorado  or 
Calif. How about Canada or Alaska.
