Jim,

I just tried to call you.  I wanted to get the attached to you before next
week.

Presently, Enron on behalf of Doyle has filed a claim for $6,212,577.54 in
Property Damage as a result of the mechanical failure on 6/14/00.  The
attached 40+ page spread sheet details Factory Mutual's review of the
covered claim with adjustments for overscope or overstatement of repair and
Exclusion E (Defective material, design, workmanship) of the General
Exclusions in the policy issued to Doyle.  The review is based on
information obtained or documentation submitted to date.  All adjustments
are subject to further discussion and submission of documentation, therefore
the adjustments should be considered estimates.  Scope adjustments are
$3,488,310.58; Exclusion E adjustments are $437,865.67, resulting in an
estimated measured claim of $2,286,401.29.

Please contact me to arrange a meeting to discuss the adjustments in detail
in Houston after next week (I have confirmed that as a group, the four of us
that came down for the last meeting cannot arrange).

Claude
