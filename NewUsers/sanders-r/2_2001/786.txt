I still don't know of any bad faith claims

In the international arbitration between United India and DPC, United India 
seeks to have the parties realigned and force DPC to be the claimant, even 
though United India invoked arbitration.  We'd rather United India remain the 
claimant because we think they will have a difficult time carrying their 
burden. We are fighting this issue in the first hearing to be held before the 
arbitrators in London on Feb.15.  One of the bases on which United India 
relies, albeit weak, is that it commenced arbitration to avoid a suit in 
Texas courts, and that in consulting Texas lawyers, they learned 
"coincidentally" that these lawyers were "defending 3 sets of  bad faith 
proceedings brought by Enron in the face of binding arbitration 
agreements."   That was in November  2000.  I've called everyone I think 
would know, and as far as I can tell,  this is not true.  We are about to 
file an affidavit stating so in the case.  Please confirm (again if I have 
already contacted you) that you know of no bad faith claims of any kind  (not 
necessarily just in the insurance context) brought by Enron against anyone 
that is currently pending or was pending at that time.  We do not know who 
the lawyers they claimed to have consulted were.  Please advise me if there 
is someone else I should ask.
Thanks for your help!
Kind regards,
Michelle
