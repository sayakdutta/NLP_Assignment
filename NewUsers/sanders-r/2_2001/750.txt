ENA will be delivering a legal opinion in connection with entering into an 
ISDA Master Agreement with Cooperatieve Centrale Raiffeisen-Boerenleenbank 
B.A.  The opinion will include the typical opinion that to the opinor's 
knowledge, no action, proceeding etc. should affect the ability of ENA to 
perform under the Swap.  Please let me know if you know of any reason why we 
could not give this opinion.
