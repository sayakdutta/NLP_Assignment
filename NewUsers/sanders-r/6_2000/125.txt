Richard:
 In looking at the Natole file today it was brought to my attention that we
have an outstanding bill for legal fees and expenses unpaid from February.

 The bill is invoice 00020782 dated 2/29/00 in the amount of $17,312.28.

 Could you please have someone look for this one and see if it can be
approved for payment?  Thanks in advance for your help.

 Best regards,

 Bill Ogden
