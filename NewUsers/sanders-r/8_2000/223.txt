I have not heard anything about it since I spoke with you last month. My 
guess is Mark is not focused on this search. Don't do anything. I will keep 
you posted

Hello, Richard.

I hope all is well with you -- and that everyone survived Julie's absence.
Sorry I wasn't able to find any IP candidates before we left for Ireland.
Are you still looking?  If so, any change in your criteria?

Best regards.
