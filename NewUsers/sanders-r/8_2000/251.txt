Richard, Judge Link said that he would fax us his rulings by Noon today
(Wednesday).  I would not hold my breath.  CFP has agreed to be on the
lookout for a fax (I will be in a hearing in Dallas) and to let us all know
by voice messages as soon as she receives something.  Let's keep Knox's
fingers crossed....

When do you think we will here something ( if today) ?
