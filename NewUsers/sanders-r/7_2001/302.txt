Thanks for your e-mail. As it turns out the judge kept the case in San Diego.

 

I just returned to the office today from a long vacation and wanted to thank
you for taking the time to leave me a voicemail regarding the outcome of the
CalPX beauty contest.  Of course, I'm disappointed, but all of us here
really appreciate your support within the committee.

I also received a message from Neal Manne indicating that you may be
interested in retaining us to represent Enron in the litigation that was
transferred to Judge Whaley in Spokane.  If so, I would be very interested
in discussing that when it's convenient for you.  I will be in the office
the balance of this week and the first 3 days of next week.  My direct line
is (206) 516-3860.

Regards,
