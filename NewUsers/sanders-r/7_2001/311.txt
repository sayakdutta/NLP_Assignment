We are looking at a possible dispute with Dynegy in relation a UK electricity trading contract.

Part of our assessment of whether we want to resolve the issue by expert determination rather than by compromise is going to be driven by the extent to which we feel we need to make the point to Dynegy that we are prepared to square up for a fight when we need to and not compromise.

In making this assessment our relationship with Dynegy in the US (and elsewhere) - in particular whether we have or have had any/many disputes with Dynegy - will be very instructive.

Please could you drop me a quick email or vmail with a thumb-nail sketch of any current and past disputes with Dynegy.

Many thanks

Paul
