Actually, I now can not do it from 11-12. The rest of the day is free.

 

I am having to move the schedule around and I was wondering if you could  meet with this candidate from 11:00 til 11:30 instead of the orginal 11:30- 12:00 PM request. Please advise....

Thank you!

 -----Original Appointment-----
When:	Monday, July 30, 2001 11:30 AM-12:00 PM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).
Where:	EB 3827
