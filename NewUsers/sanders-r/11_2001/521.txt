Have we implemented a policy?

 

I have additional names from Jay Webb's organization charts.  We may need to protect their e-mail files (in addition to the list we gave Andy last week.)  Can you give me 5 minutes to discuss?

Also, should I proceed with gathering files from Louise Kitchen and others?  

I have been reluctant to stir that pot until I knew how you wanted me to proceed.

Thanks...
