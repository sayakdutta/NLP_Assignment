The press is bad because it is accurate. I have never seen more greed, arrogance, and lack of morality.

 

this week.  The press is really bad on this.  I know that it could not be
much fun at work these days.  That with the mold and apartment
dwelling....this has not been your year.

Hope the kids and Julie are well.  Give them my love.
