How about we give her some Enron stock options.

 

First of all, it sounds like the Perd clean-up is good for everyone except
John.  So it is a go.

As for the Sanders' children Christmas...noone really came back with many
suggestions....so we still don't know what we are doing.  Although all of our
kids want for nothing.....it was still nice to say to my kids...that your
uncles did this for you. I don't have any ideas that I am trying to
sell....just trying to coordinate the effort.

A thought I do have is to have each family adopt a room and redo/refresh its
appearance.  Mom would like to see some of the rooms repainted...and this
could all be coordinated together....just a little redo would be a nice
touch.

However, that being said...I am still looking for ideas.

The last thing on my list is Mom.  She turns 70 in 13 days.  She is taking
three friends to the Perd...Betty, Jane and Lucy to play bridge.  Steve and
my family are headed for a short visit with them on Saturday the 15th.  Is
anyone planning a gift for her.  Does anyone have a suggestion.

OK, I won't bug you again.....
