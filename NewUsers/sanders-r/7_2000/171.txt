4 things:

1. You are right ---something is off about this guy. His behavior is 
irrational.
2. You are right--- you are obsessing about this too much. Relax and go back 
on vacation.
3. I handle personal matters for people all the time. This one is pretty 
minor. If it becomes more involved, we can talk about it then.
4. Relax and go back on vacation.

I will talk to you on Tues.

Richard, I think I am starting to obsess and I really don't want you guys 
working on this; however, it think that it is very odd that this Griffin guy 
over an eight week process, two registered letters and a phone conversation 
does not send a letter or bring up this "Chrome Dreams" issue from 1986 with 
us until this lawsuit is filed without our knowledge.

This guys sounds a little off.

Regards
Delainey
