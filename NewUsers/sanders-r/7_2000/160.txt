Kathy: 

I notice that a number of parties to one or more of the NSM cases have 
jointly entered into an agreement with Esquire Reporting concerning 
deposition reporting.

Just to avoid any misunderstanding, I want to confirm that ECT Securities was 
not consulted with respect to this agreement and is not a party to it.? In 
the event that we notice our own depositions, we will use Esquire as a 
convenience to the other parties.? We will make our own arrangements with 
Equire to obtain copies of transcripts of depositions noticed by others.

Thanks. 

See you in Fort Wayne.
