I don't know what the deal with Doug is. Maybe we are a lot more aggressive 
than you when it comes to inviting ourselves on his vacation. I  knew he was 
going to be there. Late last week, Julie and I decided to go to Austin 
instead of her coming to Houston for the weekend. I called Doug and told him 
we were coming. My approach is that if he wants to say no he has one chance 
to to so. He didn't say no.

I should have called you earlier. Julie must have told me to call you 5 times 
on Sat. The truth is I am so freaking tired that I just didn't do it until 
Sun. We did want to stop by and visit but we will catch you next time. Love 
Richard
