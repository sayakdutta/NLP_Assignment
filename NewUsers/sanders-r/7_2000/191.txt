Has any action been taken on this request by Shankman?

FYI...

Jeff Shankman and Fred Lagrasta are trying to change Enron's Tape Retention 
Policy from four months to forever on a number of individuals in their 
group.  Due to the inner workings of our recording system, selective tape 
retention is impossible.  It is a all or none type of situation.  Please 
review this email and our current Tape Retention Policy and decide what 
course of action is needed.  As you know this email is not enough to 
permanently stop the company's retention policy.  A new policy would need to 
be drafted and signed by John Lavorato and yourself before this could occur.

If you have any questions, please call me at 853-4764

Regards,
Darren Adamik

Per Jeff Shankman-
The attached document reflects the ENA Gas Risk Management & Middle Marketing 
Groups.
Everyone who appears on the list has a recorded line.  I am aware that all 
tapes are destroyed 
after a certain time period; however, it is imperative that these particular 
tapes are never destroyed.

Please archive these tapes in a secure location.


Many thanks,
Barbara Lewis
