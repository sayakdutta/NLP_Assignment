I sent this to Mike Dorman at Locke Liddel for his analysis. I ased for his 
answer by Thurs. Do you need it before then?

I sent the package of info I had to Richard earlier this week.  I have not 
responded to Lyon Credit and owe them such.  I'm now waiting on guidance from 
y'all as to what my response should be.  Please advise ASAP as I'd like to 
put this behind us.
