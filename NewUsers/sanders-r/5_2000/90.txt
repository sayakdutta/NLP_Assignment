I can not make the call at 2:30. I am available at 10:30-12 or after 4:30. If 
the call can not be rescheduled to those times, please call me to give me an 
update.

Neal is having Mary O'Banion, his secretary, reschedule the Beeson conf. call 
this Wednesday for 2:30 PM.  I assume it will be the same call-in number and 
same password.  Talk to you then.
