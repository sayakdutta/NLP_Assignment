Thanks for the update. Is the hearing still on?

 
Cc:	Sanders, Richard B.; Dave Weiner; Robert Alter

per your request, this e-mail will update you on the scultes lawsuit in cleveland.

you received, and we discussed, the replies we filed in support of the
half-dozen motions to dismiss and/or strike (and a sanctions motion) filed by the enron defendants.  replies were also filed by the mcdonald and sdi defendants in support of their respective motions to dismiss and/or strike, copies of which you should have received.  their briefs are more complicated than ours, but so are their facts.  an oral hearing on these motions is currently scheduled for 1:30 p.m. on September 10th.  The court has ordered no discovery until at least these motions are heard.

if you need any further detail, or have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
