Sounds good

 


Andy Edison tells me we are considering using John Quinn in case EBS files an arbitration versus Qwest.  Also, we may need California counsel to file some suits for EES against some customers for breach of contract.  The amount of these claims range from $150,000 to $2 million.  I was going to propose using Shaun Morgan and Kristen Bird, who did outstanding jobs on the UC/CSU case, to handle these. 
 


FYI. Jim
 

Hi Jim--

I am glad you got the book.  I thought reading it might help you go to sleep.  Seriously, it is a terrific piece of work.  I am sure Mark will find it helpful.

I understand that it has been finally determined the unfair competition\antitrust suits against Ernon are now is state court in California.   You have invested a lot of money educating us about your business. If there is anything we can do to help you, Robin and his team, we would be delighted to pitch in any way we can.

If you and Karrin ever make it out here, Mary and I would love to get together again.

Regards,

Bill

Bill, thank you for the treatise relating to the law of the internet.  I
have passed it on to Mark Holworth of our legal department, who often
deals with these issues for Enron.  I hope all is well with you and
yours.  All the best.  Jim
