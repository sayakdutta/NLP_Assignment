Richard and Lisa-
The watered down letter to SCE is set out below.  Let me know if you have
any comments and if Enron is willing to sign on to the letter.  We are
trying to get this out today.  Dynegy has watered this down somewhat, but I
believe has signed off on it.  Mirant has also agreed.

Also, Gov Davis's proclamation on XXX Session is set out below.  October 9
is the current date.
