I saw your picture in the paper today as ( I think) a "woman of distinction." Congrats.

 


Thanks for the direction.  EES also has a claim, separate and apart from
the claim described in my orignial email. EES's claim was in the $5 million
range and they've already gotten a distribution in the $700,000. Thanks and
hope you're doing ok and not doing as much traveling.

Yes-- deal with Willie directly. As for the claim of 1.825 million, as long
as ENA accounting agrees to that #, I am fine. Is that just ENA or does EES
also have a claim?
    
   



         
   Hello!

   It was nice to see you at the POS event last week.  I can't believe that
   we're into a new school year. I'm sorry I haven't been in touch; we did
   a
   fair amount of traveling this summer and now I'm over my head preparing
   for
   a trial that begins mid-October.

   I assume/hope that you did receive a payment from the PCA trustee on
   account of EPMI's allowed claim.  If you didn't, shame on me for not
   following up.  If you need me to, please just let me know.

   The only other open matter I have for ENA is in the Perry Gas case in
   which
   ENA filed a proof of claim in the amount of about $1,918,000.  A plan of
   liquidation has been confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court and the
   anticipated
   (not guaranteed) payout over time is expected to be in the 55-60% range.
   The post-confirmation trustee is in the process of reconciling claims.

   From the email below sent to my from the post-liquidation trustee's
   counsel
   (who was also counsel to Perry Gas during the bankruptcy case), it
   appears
   that the trustee's accounting people have been talking to Willie Stewart
   in
   accounting at ENA to try to reconcile the slightly different numbers.

   From what I understand, Willie Stewart and Perry agree that, with the
   exception of $78,337.16 that ENA owed Perry  for August 1999 deliveries,
   the amount of the prepetition claim is $1,903,490.72.   Provided that
   there
   is no disagreement about the amount of unpaid sales from Perry to ENA
   for
   August 1999, the $78,337.16 should be offset against the $1,903,490.72
   claim, which would leave ENA with a prepetition claim of $1,825,153.56.

   I would be happy to deal directly with Willie on this if you'd like --
   just
   let me know.  If Willie agrees with the $78,337.16 amount due to Perry
   for
   August 1999, do I have authority to agree to the prepetition claim of
   $1,825,153.56?  Perry has made one distribution and I'll get the
   commitment
   up front that as soon as the agreed order allowing ENA's claim, Perry
   will
   cut a check for the first distribution.

   If my case settles, I'll give you a call to set up a lunch.  I'd like to
   get caught up.  Thanks and take care.
