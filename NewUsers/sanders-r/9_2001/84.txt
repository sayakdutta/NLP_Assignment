The attached info about the Judge being in that small group with two lawyer=

JOINT DEFENSE

I spoke today with Sweetwater's counsel, Rob Hanna of Best, Best & Krieger.
Two items to report:

=091.   Judge Sammartino.  Hanna alerted me to an article in the recent
San Diego Lawyer  (see attached).  The article concerns the "M (for
Motherhood) Group," a group of 10 San Diego women lawyers that have met
twice a week for the past 21 years.  Judge Sammartino is a member of the
group, as are two lawyers in Hanna's firm - Arelene Prater and Tina Dyer.
Hanna said he wanted defendants to be aware the relationship between the BB=
K
lawyers and Sammartino.  Hanna said he has no plans to challenge Judge
Sammartino, but wanted defense lawyers to be alerted to the issue.  Unless
someone has a different suggestion, let's factor this into the mix when we
revisit the coordination issues next week.

=092.  Case Management Hearing.  Hanna reported that his office had
contacted Judge Hayes' clerk to ask whether the CMC hearing (set for 9/28 i=
n
Sweetwater) would be going forward. Hanna's office was told the CMC would
remain on calendar.  Hanna and I jointly called Judge Hayes' Court Clerk,
David Lim, to follow up.  Mr. Lim confirmed that, notwithstanding the
assignment order to Judge Sammartino,  Judge Hayes wants the parties to
provide a status report at the CMC.  He confirmed that the Court wants the
parties to file CMC questionnaires, although he suggested that the Court is
probably most interested in the coordination status.  The CMC questionnaire
is due Friday, Sept. 21 (although Mr. Lim said we could filed anytime prior
to Thursday noon (Sept 27).  Given that Judge Hayes appreciates strict
compliance with the local rules, I suggest we file this Friday.   We will
prepare a proposed joint CMC statement for all defendants and circulate the
same tomorrow.
