   RESENT AS OF MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 17.  I WOULD LIKE TO PROCEED WITH THE
   CALL ON
   A BRIEF BASIS TO SEE IF THERE IS ANY INTEREST IN A MEETING WITH SCE OR A
   CONFERENCE CALL WITH SCE's COUNSEL. THE CONFERENCE CALL SHOULD LAST LESS
   THAN 30 MINUTES.  IF NEED BE, WE CAN RECONVENE LATER TODAY.


   We have set a call to discuss SCE for this Monday.  The agenda will be
   similar to the agenda of the 12th, except that the California
   Legislature is
   set to adjourn this Friday evening, so we should know what ensured.  As
   it
   has been our intent to be as inclusive as possible, if there are other
   creditors that you wish to invite, please do so.
