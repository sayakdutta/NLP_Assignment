The questioning by the panel did not reveal their intentions. The attys who 
were there  think that the case could go either way. We should know in 2-6 
weeks.

Richard, have you heard from Mike Beatty (or Charlie Tetrault) on the results 
of his argument at the MDL Panel hearing that had been scheduled for last 
Friday?  I am assuming that I have gotten the date right and that it has not 
been rescheduled.

Thanks.

Britt
