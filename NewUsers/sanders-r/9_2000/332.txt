Richard:

I propose the following text:

As you are aware, we have discussed in the past, and intend to discuss in
the future, the potential for settlement of the matters in dispute in the
litigation currently pending between TVA and Enron in the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee.  This letter is to
confirm our mutual understanding that such discussions are confidential and
not admissible in evidence in that litigation, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.
Evid. 408.

Bob
