Not unless you can cure laziness. I will call him this week.

 

Anything I can do to expedite this?

Hi Sheila, 

My partner Donn Pickett has been trying to get Richard Sanders to sign off on the attached conflicts letter concerning our representation of Reliant in the litigation in California in which Enron is also involved.  I understand the letter confirms prior conversations between Richard and Donn.  Karen suggested that, because you see Richard frequently, maybe we could enlist your help in getting the paperwork processed.  We would greatly appreciate that.

I hope all is going well for you and your family.  Let me know if you have any questions.
