Bonnie is an in-house litigator for Enron who needs Kevin for another 
lawsuit. Obviously, you will have access to him also.

I spoke with Gary Grote late this afternoon.  He reiterated that he believed 
that we were very close on the consulting agreement and that he had only 
minor issues with our proposal.  He told me that he would have a written 
response to me before the end of this week, and he agreed that it would be a 
good idea for us to meet with Kevin the week of November 27-December 1.  I 
will let you know when I hear back from him.
