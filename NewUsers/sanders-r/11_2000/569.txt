Richard,

I have confirmed with David Best this morning that the settlement in this 
matter is "done and dusted", to use David's phrase.  I have received, and 
will shortly send to you, a letter from our underwriters' counsel, confirming 
the settlement.  Payment will be made within twenty-one days, which means 
before year-end.  Our barrister and expert have been advised to stop work 
immediately.  Parenthetically, we were able to avoid becoming liable for the 
7,500 pound advance to our barrister that would have otherwise come due last 
Friday.

Let me know if you want me to participate in a conference with John Nowlan to 
explain our reasons for the settlement.  By the way, this finally wraps up 
all the M/V HAVMANN arbitration/litigation.  Best advises that there is no 
one left for us to pursue, and no one left who is pursuing us.

One question:  Best wants to know if you want the $475,000 to come directly 
to us, or to come to him, and to be disbursed to us by him net of agreed fees 
and expenses that we owe.  One way or another, I assume that you ultimately 
want the money wired to us, but I wonder if you know of a person (or 
department) from whom to determine the proper wire transfer account/address.  
If not, I am sure that I can find out.  Thanks.

Britt
