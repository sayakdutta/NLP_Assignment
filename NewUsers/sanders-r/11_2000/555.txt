Hello Energyphiles:

OK, perhaps it was inevitable.  But it is now official.  A team of San
Diego's best anti-trust and class action attorneys has been assembled to
take on the electric generators and marketers in California state court in
an effort to return the electricity overcharges that have battered San
Diego and the rest of California this year.    A press conference will be
held to discuss the consumer class action lawsuit to be filed today.

WHEN:   11am - noon

WHERE:    550 West C  St.  (b/t Columbia & India)
  Suite 1810
  Law Offices of Levine, Steinberg, Miller & Huver
  619-231-9449

WHAT:  Copies of the filed complaint will be made available at that
time.  UCAN's   executive director and the attorney team will be
available
to answer questions   about the complaint.   We are hopeful that
we can
post the complaint to the   UCAN web site later today.
