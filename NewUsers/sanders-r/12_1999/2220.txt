I thought these were taken care of long ago. I think they relate to Neal's 
work for EES on the chilled water project for Enron Field. Let me know.

I still have all those old "counseling"
invoices on our "accounts receivable
watchlist."  They total $9,500 and some
are more than a year old.  Any chance of
getting them paid so we can be clean at
the end of the year?
