In an effort to continuously improve the service we provide to our customers 
we have created one central mail ID for all IT Purchase Requests.  This new 
ID is Enron IT Purchasing.  Please send all future IT Purchasing requests to 
this ID as opposed to sending your requests to one individual in the 
purchasing group.  If you do not use this ID your purchase request may be 
delayed.  Also, please remember that all Technology purchases should go 
through the IT Purchasing department if you intend to use them for business 
purposes.

Thank you for your cooperation in this matter.

Regards,
Bob Hillier
