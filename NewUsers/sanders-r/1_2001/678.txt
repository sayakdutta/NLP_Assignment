As you will note from the attached e-mail, Bernard Glatzer is now pro se. It 
is only a matter of time until the case is over.

I am pleased to report to you that I received a fax on Sunday from Bernard
Glatzer reading as follows:

"Andrew Hayes and Boies, Schiller & Flexner were discharged by me for
obvious cause two and one half weeks ago in the above entitled matters, but
have not yet filed the appropriate withdrawals pursuant to my specific
instructions.  Until further notice please direct all correspondence and
communications to me at 2707 Creston Ave.' #2F, Bronx, New York 10468 or at
(718) 584-3998 (Tel. & Fax)."

Is that great sucking sound Andy Hayes notifying his carrier?
