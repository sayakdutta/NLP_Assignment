Is that # right? What gives?






I have settled the Ecogas/Enron/Randy Maffett lawsuit.  No need to thank me,just send me gifts.  Seriously, I talked this morning with Tom Hall and we agreed that Ecogas would pay him $53,000.  Hall has agreed to release Enron, Ecogas, Maffett and every affiliate, related party and subsidiary.  He will also release any and all patent issues. The goal is for him to move on with his life and for us to move on as well.  I have asked Doug Daniels to prepare the settlement papers reflecting such an agreement.
