Thanks Richard,

The reason I asked was because our IT people in Houston have told us that we cannot transfer emails that we need beyond the retention period to word documents.  That seemed a bit strange, but they were quite emphatic.   I have clarified the rule with our IT head.

Thanks a lot, and take care,

Sorry for the late reply. You are correct about  the policy. 








Hi Richard,

Someone made an inquiry to me regarding the policy.  

It is my understanding that if email is not deleted or copied into a word document in order to avoid deletion, then it will be (or should be) destroyed automatically after the expiration of the retention period.  We have been telling our people to only move information from Outlook to Word documents if they feel that they need to retain it for more than the appropriate retention period.

Please let me know if this is consistent with the policy.

Thanks, and hope all is well with you.
