This is something interesting to put in your back pocket.

I recommend reading CAISO's response.  This letter was reported in last week's trade press.

I am told that BPA does not consider this letter confidential even though it is labeled as such by CAISO.

Many of the  CAISO "backpedal" statements made re: claims of strategic bidding would apply equally to other importers.
