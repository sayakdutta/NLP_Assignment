Don - the draft looks good. My only thought is that we may not need to
require that the posted copies be file stamped. It seems to me that this
requirement could cause some delay. Moreover, the hard copies people get
by ordinary service are not file stamped. Given that my client is
continuing to incur copying costs, I ask that you  try to get this
proposal circulated as quickly as possible. Thanks- Barrett









Clay, Jay and Barrett,
      The three of you strike me as the best choices to give me feedback
on the attached draft of informal procedures I recommend we propose
to kansas JDT members.   I would appreciate your review and
suggestions.
