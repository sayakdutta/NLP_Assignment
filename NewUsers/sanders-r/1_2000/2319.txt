Please send me a copy of the e-mail along with Kevin's response.








Linda, I am faxing you a copy of an e-mail I recently reviewed from Brian
Barth to Lisa Mellencamp dated 8/20/99.  In the e-mail, Brian writes that he
is providing Lisa with comments "intended to supplement Kevin McConville's
memo dated August 19, 1999 regarding the NSM lawsuit."  The documents you
sent me do not include any memo from Kevin McConville dated Aug. 19, 1999.
Can you please check with Kevin regarding this memo and (if you are able to
get a copy) please fax it to me.

Thanks.
