Richard:  I have reviewed your draft response letter to Enerstar and have 
discussed it with Max.  Attached please find a black-lined version of the 
letter reflecting the few minor changes we suggest.  If the revised letter is 
acceptable to you, please send it to Enerstar as soon as possible.

Please call with questions or comments.
