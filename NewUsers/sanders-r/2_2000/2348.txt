Talked with Tom Deen today. He wants to depose either Miller or Virgo on 3/9
and the other of them the next day, Friday 3/10. I said I'd check their
availability. Can you advise? He also said he wanted to depose another Enron
employee whom he claims actually went to Korea: one Harry Moltreu (sp.?)
Any idea who this is? He agrees on mediating the last 2 weeks in March, and
to a continuance of the April setting. He also confirmed that Natole had
sold either all or part of his business, but retained all interest in the
lawsuit. I said we'd want to go through this in Natole's deposition, and he
said they would have the details then. Natole is on for next Friday 2/18.
