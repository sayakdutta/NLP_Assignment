Benefits needs your dependent's social security number on file.  As of now, 
our records show a blank field.  

If your dependent (s) do not have a US social security number, please provide 
their tax ID number.  

Complete the attached form and fax it to the Benefits Department attention;  
Susan Jones at 713/646-8454.  



Thank you,
