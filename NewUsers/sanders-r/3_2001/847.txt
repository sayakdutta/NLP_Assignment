I told Sandy that this looked fine to me but I am not a trasactional lawyer. 
I just want to make sure you know the obvious: Intratex has the Beeson case 
attached to it so we nedd to maintain our ability to bankrupt or otherwise 
separate this company from Mother Enron.

Richard,
In connection with the sale of Houston Pipe Line Company, we are transferring 
ownership in the above-referenced companies from HPL to an entity now named 
LOA, Inc. which, until closing of the HPL sale, is a wholly owned sub of HPL. 
At, or just prior to closing, that ownership will be transferred to Enron 
Corp. since these companies are excluded assets. There is a note in the Corp. 
Secretary's records that indicates no mergers or consolidations of assets of 
these entities should take palce without Bob Williams approval. I am assuming 
that now means you and I do not believe the transfer of the stock qualifies 
as either a merger or a consolidation. However, since I believe the issue 
centers around pending or threatened litigation I thought I would pass this 
along in the event you needed to know or had an issue with it. Please let me 
know ASAP if you do--I am making the conveyance effective February 28th

Thanks,
Sandi
