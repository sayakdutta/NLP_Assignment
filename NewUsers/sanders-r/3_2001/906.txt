Richard:
      I spoke to Healey last night about this.We arre in agreement that one 
lawyer should argue this and it should be a local lawyer. Healey's firm did 
the papers. Bob Steiner is a the most senior lawyer at that firm, is highly 
regarded, former Bar President and I would assume is well known to Moskowitz. 
As such this is acceptable to me, particularly with Healey providing the 
back-up. I suspect it was my call to Healey that prompted this e-mail.

I notice that Chris Healy and his partner are going to argue the motion to
stay. Are we ok with this? Also--could one of you call me after the conf.
call and let me know if anything important is discussed.
