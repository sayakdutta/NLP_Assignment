Yes, unless Richard or Gary say otherwise before the payment deadline.

Christian,

EPMI owes the PX a payment of approximately $25k this Friday for real-time 
charges for December.  It's the true-up payment (volume management calls it 
the "final" invoice).

Query:  Should we advise the PX to take the payment out of EPMI's collateral, 
like we did last time?  I told Brett "yes," subject to check with you.

Brett will wait to hear from you or me before he advises Houston.

Thanks,

Steve
