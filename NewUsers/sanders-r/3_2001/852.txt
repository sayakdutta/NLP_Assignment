Richard:  The following is the text of paragraph 13 of the settlement
agreement:

 The parties agree that they will not disclose this Agreement, or any
matter relating thereto or to the underlying dispute to any third party
without the prior written consent of the other party; provided however, that
nothing in this Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release shall limit or
prohibit the ability of any Party, without the knowledge or consent of any
other Party, to make legally required disclosure in response to regulatory
or financial inquiries (including those for accounting purposes), subpoenas,
or to discharge any disclosure obligations they may have under any
applicable federal or state laws, or to disclose the terms of this
Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release to any regulatory agency having
jurisdiction over one or more of the Parties.
