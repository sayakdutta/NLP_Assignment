I am scheduled to be in London next week.  I would like to sit down and talk 
to you about this.

Paul Simons suggested I wrote to you to inform you that I am presently 
handling a number of small arbitration/claims matters on behalf of Enron 
Metals, which are subject to English law and London arbitration (LME).  They 
are generally for quite small amounts (presently from US$ 68,000 to US$ 
approx. 400,000).  I would be grateful if you could let me know the extent to 
which you wish to be involved or to monitor these.
