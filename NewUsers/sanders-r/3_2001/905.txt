Yes---Dave Weiner at Hahn Loeser, 216-241-2824. I am not  sure I want to 
coordinate that much, at least yet. Key Corp refused to wave conflict for 
several other firms and I still think I might be able to talk my way out of 
it. Do you think that if I went to Cleveland and talked to Schultes, perhaps 
with a business person, that we could get out?

Does enron have counsel yet in Cleveland?  Counsel for the other defendants
there are anxious to coordinate with Enron''s lawyer once selected.
