It is not clear to me what precipitated this most inquiry from Anadarko or
why it is being made at this time.  I thought that we had gotten over this
hump.

Assuming that you are not anxious for this task, I propose that I tell them
that, because you are currently tied up on other matters, I will be the
temporary representative on the committee and that after the holidays we
will be back in touch further.

Such a response would parry this somewhat odd inquiry / statement, and will
allow us to reassess the situation when Andy gets on board and gets his feet
wet.

Agree?

Please advise whether Mr. Tetrault or Mr. Sanders will represent Enron on
the Wright Steering Committee.  We have agreed to make a concerted effort to
obtain the approval of all Steering Committee members in connection with
significant group decisions.
