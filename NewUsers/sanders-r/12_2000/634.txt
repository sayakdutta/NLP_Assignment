Today I received a copy of the Correct Consolidated Complaint in the 
FirstWorld Securities Litigation.  I am happy to report that Kevin and Steve 
are NOT listed as defendants, which effectively dismisses them from the 
case.  I will be sending a copy of the Complaint to each of you for your 
files.  Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thank you.
