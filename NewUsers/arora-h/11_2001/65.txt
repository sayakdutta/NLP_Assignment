What I heard was this was being handled by Exelon guys, so it makes sense.  These guys prefer dealing with old utiliity guys and so we will need to break-in to get access to some of these deals.

Harry,

Update on Comed. It's unbelievable how unresponsive these guys are.

We spoke to our contact at Comed and he gave us the names of two other contacts at Exelon that would be handling those type of options.  Doug and Maria left messages when I was out of the office.  We have yet to hear back from them.

Were you ever able to get ahold of Comed on this?
