Eric,

Leg B has already terminated (06/30/1999), and legs 9 and C are in Canadian books.  I left a message w/ book admins in Canada.  As soon as they get w/ me I'll run a minibook for you on those 2 deals.

Thanks man, however, I think we are missing leg 9, B, C on the JP swaps.  Could you re-run and send back?

I would really appreciate it.

Eric
