Isreal,

I apologize, but I'm going to have to cancel.  We've got some major problems 
that I have to handle.  Monday at 10:30 am works for me.  Let me know if it's 
good for you.

Thanks,

Errol, X5-8274

Hi Errol,

I just wanted to see if I could sit with you for a few minutes this morning.  
We had tentatively said around 10:30 a.m. this morning.  Please let me know 
if this is still okay for you.  Thanks again for your help.
