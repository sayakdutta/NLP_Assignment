Tommy,

No problem, I'm not in a rush. I hope you're feeling better.  I have only 
request.  Could you please come by before 2:30pm, if at all possible.  I have 
to have my computer uninterrupted after 2:30.  Thanks.  Here are the vitals.

I apologize for the delay in replying to you, I've been out sick the past two 
days.  I show this schedule to be installed Thursday.  This is the info I 
need from you if you need 
me to install it for you:
Are you using Windows 2000 or NT 4. ?
Lotus Notes or Outlook.
If your on Outlook, have you submitted an erequest for Extend Connect?

Let me know.

Can you let me know when you plan on installing my Palm?

Thanks,
