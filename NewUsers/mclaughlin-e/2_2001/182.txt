Cecillia,

When we choose FIMAT as a broker in Exchange Capture, we can not save a deal 
because the account number section is blank.  Could you please fix this as 
soon as possible.  Please call me with any questions at X5-8274.

Hi Errol, please provide the following information...

1. The name of the new broker.
2. The commodity(s) under this new broker.
3. The account number and the account description for this new broker.
4. Any sub account number(s).
5. I assume that we going to set this up as a clearing broker, not an exec 
broker.
