Frank,

After looking the packet over in detail, I found the questions to be a great 
tool, especially the ones aimed at the 'soft skills'.  Previously when 
interviewing people I always struggled for a way to ask these type of 
questions legally and ethically.  I think the packet also will aid in my 
organization and will keep the interview moving at an efficient pace.

Thanks,

Errol McLaughlin
