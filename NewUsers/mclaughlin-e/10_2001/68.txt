Working on it -- Joey is running mini-books.

 
Cc:	Keiser, Kam

As discussed yesterday, please run a mini-book on two the  P&G deals that I gave Errol (details showing the exact legs involved with NG-MM are also given) to determine the exact position and M to M value of these deals.  These deals will ultimately be given to EES for them to manage but we will keep our traders indifferent P&L and position wise.  If you can get this to me by early this afternoon, that would be great.

Thanks

Jeff, 

Can you take this over for me?  There is a deal with Procter & Gamble that Troy Black originated.  It was booked as a sale with ENA but should be in the EES books.  According to Mark Breese ENA should be kept whole, to the mids only, not against offers.  There were also hedges on the volumes that need to be moved as well.  I have asked Troy and Derek Baily about these hedges and they don't know anything about it.  I doubt that a hedge was done specifically for these deals so we may have to get bids/offers to fill the position that is left when the deals are moved to EES.  Can you get with Derek Baily and take care of this today?

Thanks

Kam
