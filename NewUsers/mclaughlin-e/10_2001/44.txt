You doubt my stamina & my prowess in holding my liquor--et tu Brute??!!!  I'm not feeling too bad - considering the time I got home.  I didn't want to wake you.  I've been doing the meeting circuit again this morning, so that has kept me lively.  The post lunch period when things are quiet is going to be brutal though.

How is your day going?



 

Are you alive or did they drink you under the table?
