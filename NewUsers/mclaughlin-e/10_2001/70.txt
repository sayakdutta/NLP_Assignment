Norman,

I am not able to calc using the shortcut on my desktop.  I can copy the Post-ID and set it up.  When I try to calc I get a message saying, "unable to connect".  Can you please help?

Thanks,

Errol

Dear All,

Please test the Stage Release of PortCalc version 4.2.1s1 and let us know of the results.  

The executable is      /stage/egs-home/ermt/bin/pwrcalc_slr        

	New Features:

Version 4.2.1s1

Changes Affecting All:

Asian strip

Fixed the Curve shift numbers in the adhoc table.

Index Option

Break up one single adhoc record into two records for physical and financial.

Basis Option

Fixed the issue on the break down of Peak and Off Peak curve shift for the second delivery point.

Performance Improvement

Disable unnecessary sensitivity calculation to improve performance typical for hourly options.

Cross Portfolio flag form deal entry is now used. Before this change, PortCalc used to determine which deal is cross portfolio using internal logic.

Curve and Position Manager

PortCalc will now populate the peak_hours_num, off_peak_hours_num, sun_peak_hours_num and sat_peak_hours_num columns in the adhoc table to provde volumetric information for the Curve and Position Manager.


Changes Affecting Australia:

Asian strip

Always use curve price for effective date to avoid next-day financial true up for that day, so that current previous day value can tie up yesterday's value.

SRA

	New Deal type.


Changes Affecting VATR:

Populate the INSTR_TYPE_CD as TRANSMISSION in the pwr_vatr_port_posn  table for Transmission deals.


Please do not hesitate to ask if there is any questions.

	Thanks,


Norman.
