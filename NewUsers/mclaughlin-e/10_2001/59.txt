Tom,

The GasPow position is correct.

Thanks,
Errol

 


All, the numbers below are from EnPower Adhoc (commodity only and without ancillary curve positions) for EOD 10/26. Please confirm if these are consistent with your reports -- we want to be able to use these numbers for the DPR.

Also note, these do not include positions outside EnPower; I'll pull those spreadsheet positions from RiskTrac.

Thanks.
- Tom
