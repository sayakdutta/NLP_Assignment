We have a request from AA.  I listed the books involved in this attachment.  I have asked Kim Theriot group to provide some of the confirmation information or whatever they can get us.  

We need:
deal tickets
print out of curve strip (curve fetch)
global counterparty database print screen
new deal forward detail

Per Jeff we need to get this back to them today.

You can drop me off a copy of your deals and I'll coordinate with AA.

Thanks

Kam
