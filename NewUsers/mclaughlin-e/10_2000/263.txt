Hey!  I hope you are having a good day.  I hate that I missed you last 
night.  We had a good time at the game.  The seats we had were on the floor 
behind the basket on the visiting team's side of the court.  We were all 
drinking and acting a fool so the cameraman put us up on the big screen.  A 
few of us went out after the game, so I am pretty tired today.  Being the 
alcoholic that I am, you know I couldn't just have one drink (ha ha).  

I didn't want anything special.  I just wanted to catch you before you left  
Be careful, and I'll talk to you tonite.

See you soon,

E.L.M.
