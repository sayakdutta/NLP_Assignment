Smiling.  At  your comments about Samantha - yes she did - and yes she is 
amazing.  Our Holidays were wonderful.  Our New Years was no big deal at 
all.  We (Kenny and I)  were a little under the weather and therefore did 
nothing - I  went to bed at 12:01   .   anyway - love to get togther for 
dinner soon.  have aq nice week.
