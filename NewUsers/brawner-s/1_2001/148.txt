Jeff,

Just a quick note to say "thank you" for your comments at year end.  I 
sincerely appreciated your comments and support.
I hope your Holidays were safe, healthy, and happy.  Say when am I going to 
see that new home of yours?  You know it is hard to continue to live 
vicariously through you if I don't know what to picture!   


Sandra
