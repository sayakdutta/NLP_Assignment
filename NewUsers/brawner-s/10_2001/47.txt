Why are you so cranky?  Anything I can do?   Hey I spoke to my friend (mike) and told him about you and Jon - you know all the good stuff, how nice you guys are, what good friends we have become, that you all live in Greatwood (like they do), that you guys have a 2 year old son (like they do), that your families are all up North (like thiers are)  and he want the six of us to have dinner so he and his wife can get to know you and JOn ...Interested?


 

i could use some positive thoughts.  i am having a cranky week!
