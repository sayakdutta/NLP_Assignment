The meeting is scheduled for Wednesday, Feb 2 at 10:00 AM in EB 19C2.  
There is a projector in that conference room already.

Thanks!

Shirley-

Vince asked me to arrange a mtg Wednesday between himself, Vasant and I (for 
30 minutes+). Can you coordinate this? (I already emailed Vasant and told him 
about it). I would like an overhead projector for it, if possible. Thanks,

Clayton
