Gary, Peter,

This is a copy of my London presentation. I expect to
make some minor changes to this presentation for March 13.

 <<REAL OPTIONS VALUATION IN THE NEW ECONOMY>>

This is a draft of what I was thinking of presenting.  I was not planning to
go over any specific options or OPAs (these are covered by confidentiality
clauses and I have to be careful from a competitive standpoint) but to give
the audience a few of the "real world" applications and challenges.  I
welcome any thoughts or comments.

> We are all speaking at the March Real Options Session in NY.   My work in
> real options in the energy field has come, to a large part, from my
> casewriting in your two organizations, so I feel that we should probably
> allocate more time toward your presentations and less to mine.   While we
> have a two hour block among the three of us, I think we can freely
> re-arrange things to produce the best result.  Would you two like to
> schedule a brief conference call to coordinate our talks?    I am free
> virtually all of next Wednesday 2/23, perhaps we could talk at 10 am (EST)
> or 2 pm (EST)?   I am happy to arrange the call, if you send me your phone
> numbers.  Thanks.
