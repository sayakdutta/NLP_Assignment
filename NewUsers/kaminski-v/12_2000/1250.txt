Dear Vince,

Thanks for your phone call this morning. I will ring Mike tonight, i.e. 
Houston tomorrow morning. 

....had a look at the temps and anomalies over CA, looks warm for this time 
of the year (Dec.), there has been an increase in the night time 
T_min, and T_max remains at an above average level. 

I will start setting up my models over CONUS this week. 


Regards,
Christian
