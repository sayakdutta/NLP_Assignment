Dear Mr. Kamiski,
I am working on the attendee list
for EMF's working group meeting next
week. We usually distribute a listing of
all which includes everyone's contact
information (address/phone/fax/email)
and I don't have that information from you.
If you would like to be included in this listing,
please provide the above information as
soon as possible.
Thank you,
Edith Leni
