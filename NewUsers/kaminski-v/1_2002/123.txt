One day Father Boudreaux and Pastor Thibodeaux wus fishin on the side
of dey road. Dey thoughtfully made a sign saying:

                   "The End is Near, Cher' !
                    Turn yurself 'Round now,
                    before it's too late!,"

and showed it to each passing car.

Well dis one car dat passed didn't appreciate the sign and wus shouting
at dem and hollin "Leave us alone, you religious nuts!"

Den all of a sudden dey heard a big splash and dey looked at each other
and Fr. Boudreaux said .....
"ya think we shoulda just put a sign dat says  'Bridge Out' instead?"
