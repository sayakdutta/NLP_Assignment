 

Vince,

I'm glad you can come.  I'm very sorry about what happened at Enron.

I look forward to getting a chance to hook-up with you.

I will go ahead and have you registered, without affiliation, unless you
give me one.

Look forward to it.

Michael

	I really appreciate it. It will be a great opportunity to give
you
	an update about my plans. I hope to continue working

	I move to a new position. My last day at Enron will be January
the 31st.

	   The CERA contract with Enron has expired, but it would be my
pleasure to
