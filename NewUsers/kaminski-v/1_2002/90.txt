 

Hello Vince, hope you had a good holiday, dispite it all. I don't know if you received a copy of our end of year issue so I've attached it here. The risk section received some pretty good marks. I don't know what your plans are going foreward, but I would like to keep the communication open. I've been playing around with a few concepts for special sections in the Risk Desk -- tossed around the ideas to a few big fivers, CRO's and the like, guys like Pokalsky and so on. The publication is growing pretty steadily so I think some kind of relationship between the two of us might be good for all involved. Anyhow, would like to discuss the details sometime soon-- what's good for you?
Best
John

John,
Sorry for a delay in responding to your message.
I shall have to clear the request with my PR people.
What is the topic of the interview? I need a general
outline of the questions.

            Hello Vince-- we're finally getting around to reviewing that book you
   had a hand in writing -- good stuff to be sure. actually joe p[okalsky
   is helping me out a bit on the math. Listen, the publication is doing
   quite well, I think we go to about 4 or 5 thousand folks these days. I
   was wondering if for the august issue (it drops on or around the 27th)
   you might carve out about 15 minutes for a quick Q&A -- softballs
   mostly, no surprizes. I'd like to dove tail it to the book review. I'll
   forward a set of 5-6 questions in the next day or so. Any chance of an
   interview in the next couple weeks?
   Best,
   John
