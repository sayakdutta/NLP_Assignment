We can try Kim Watson (713-853-3098). I am sure she would be interested.

Whom can you recommend? So many people have left.

Vince, 
I've ended up interviewing 20 people in the Research Group; everyone was very cooperative and insightful.  Now, I am in the process of synthesizing the information into coherence.  I think it'll be a great story, with even more substance and depth than I had initially envisioned.
When we talked a few weeks ago, you offered to give me one or two names of people with whom I could talk with to get the perspective on the internal (and perhaps external) business value of the Research Group from someone outside of the Research Group.  I assume that would be someone within Enron.  Could you send me the name(s) and contact information for this?  The conversations would be relatively brief and either in person or by phone.
Thanks again for your interest and support.  I'll keep you informed of progress!
