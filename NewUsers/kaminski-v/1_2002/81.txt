I wish you and your family all the best. I has truly been my privilege to work with you and get to know you over the last several years. You and your group has taught me a lot and I feel very grateful for this.
 
It has been a sad ending to a phenomenal period at Enron. The one thing that no one can take from us is the experince we gained and the relationships we've made.
 
Good Luck and Best Wishes
