Stinson,

A request for help. I have quite a few letters of recommendation to write today
and it's not going to be an easy day.

Can you help me with this letter for Shalesh? The job description is attached.

Dear Vince,

As per our conversation I am attaching my resume and the job description below.  Please feel free to critique and give me some feedback on my resume, I will appreciate it immensely.  Once again I want to thank you for all the help and assistance you have given me over the last two years.  I am convinced that I couldn't have asked for or gotten a better boss than you.  It has truly been a pleasure and an honor to work for you.  Thank you for the opportunity!

Sincerely,

Shalesh Ganjoo
