Jo,

Thanks for your message.
I am sure Nelson would consider consulting though it does not 
guarantee any continuity of support for you.

Please, let me know what you decide to do over the next few days.
The curtain will drop on my group on Tuesday.

In case we shall not connect before Tuesday, let me say it was a privilege working with you.
I wish you luck with Enron or any other company you may work for in the future.

Vince
