 

Hi Peter:

I really appreciate your taking the time to interview me
and I am very interested in the position. 

Organizational ability is one of my strong points along
with the fact that my length of service with Enron gives 
me a great deal of knowledge in getting things done as 
quickly as possible.

I really like setting things up and seeing the results
come together quickly and efficiently.  

I am a quick learner and a willing learner and feel that
I would be able to assist you a great deal with the Estate.

If you have any other questions, please let me know.  

Also, I know that Vince Kaminski would be willing to answer 
any questions you might have. 

Sincerely,

Shirley Crenshaw
Administrative Coordinator
Enron Research Group
713-853-5290
