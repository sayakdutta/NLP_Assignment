Steve,

Prediction Company was confused. No problem - I got the outline from memory and I shall cc 
you. I shall attach your minutes to my memo for Greg.


Vince

 

Vince I just picked up your voicemail - sorry, but I thought your meeting was 14:30 Houston time!  I hope  I haven't ruined your meeting at all.  My handwritten notes really are unreadable, but I'm sending them now "for the record".

Steve

 

Steve,

Two things. 

1. Can you fax the meeting notes from last Monday to 713 646 2503?
I have written the summary for Greg for the conference call tomorrow but
want to make sure I did not miss any important point.

2. Assuming we go ahead and forge a formal relationship,
how would you like to be involved? Out of London or, possibly,
Houston? Please, let me know.

Vince
