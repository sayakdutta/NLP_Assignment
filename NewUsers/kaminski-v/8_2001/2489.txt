Norman,

Sorry  for a delay in responding to you. The trip this week, August
17, is impossible. As you know by now, our CEO, Jeff Skilling, resigned today
and Greg will be tied up in analyst calls for the next few days.

We still hope to be able to visit you on the 24th, as long
as you are still available on this day.

Just in case, please advise me about you availability on Friday, August 31st.


Vince
