Vince,

As a result of last week's Crude & Products recruiting event, the following individual has been identified as strong candidate for your group.  Please advise as to how you would like to proceed with this individual.  Brian is readily available to return to Houston to interview with your group.  Charles or I can coordinate this event.

Thanks,
Johnny
