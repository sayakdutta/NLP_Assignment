Greetings. 

Let me once again acknowledge with thanks Enron's generosity in hosting us 
to a baseball game 7/16.  It was only upon reviewing the ticket price at 
home that I recognized just how generous Enron's hosting was. 

As we agreed July 16 - 17, I write at this time regarding the first of 
three e-mails.  In this one, I seek your annual participation in the 
Foundations of Energy Finance class at UT.  Subsequent to your 
presentation, your Public Affairs colleagues may choose to schedule a 
reception at which Enron-specific recruting, internship and other 
information may be disseminated.  For this reason, I cc Director of Public 
Affairs Mike Rosen. 

You sought a proposal of several alternate dates for your presentation.  I 
am pleased to offer the following as alternative dates:  Sep. 24, Sep. 26, 
Oct. 1, Oct. 8, Oct. 10, Oct. 15 and Oct. 17.  Let me know if your schedule 
requires a wider set of alternatives.  Also, please advise if you would 
like the entire 2 1/2 hr. (2 to 5 p.m., including breaks) time slot, or 
whether you would prefer a subset thereof. 

Once we have determined a date, and if a same-day 5 p.m. Enron reception is 
deemed desirable, I ask Mike or his designee to contact my Assist. Energy 

512-232-7386) to coordinate matters. 

Best, 
Ehud
