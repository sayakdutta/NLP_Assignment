Ed, Berney,

Please, take a look at one of the resumes (David B. Good)
recommended for structuring by my friend.

Vince:

In this third e-mail, I write you concerning the interest expressed by two
colleagues in being considered for employment by Enron Corp.:

1.  The first candidate is UT Finance Ph.D. student James Doran, who is
confidentially re-evaluating his interest in the Ph.D. program.  James has
done some consulting work with me in the energy area, and thus has some
background in the field.  Although his quantitative/computing skills do not
quite match those of Cantekin, I strongly believe they warrant an
invitation for interview at Enron, and recommend you consider such an
invitation affirmatively.

I enclose James' resume in Resume2001.doc.

2.  The second candidate is David B. Good, formerly of the Nucleus Corp.  A
resident of Houston, Dave has an MBA from Wharton and several years
experience in the energy sector.  You met Dave during the recent EPRM
training course in Houston.  I have had occasion to work with Dave whilst
he was director of quantitative analysis at Nucleus Corp. and have found
him an MBA with good quantiative skills and excellent intuition.  While I
cannot recommend him for your Research Group, I believe he is well suited
for a structuring/marketing position within Enron.

Dave's resume is also enclosed herewith in DBG resume.doc.

Should you and/or your colleagues have any questions regarding James or
Dave, please feel free to contact me.

Best,
Ehud
