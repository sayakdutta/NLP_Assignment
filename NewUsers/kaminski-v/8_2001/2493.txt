Scott,

Thanks for the message.
I have talked to HR today and they will be contacting you
regarding the offer.

We shall work out the details this week. Of course, we have to go
through our usual procedures and I leave it to our HR department.

Vince

 


Vince,
 
I hope that Sriram is doing well, and are  you interested in seeing some more people.  Because I have an excellent  Risk Management Developer from Ernst Young risk management who also knows energy  and would like to move to Houston.
 
Talk to you soon.
