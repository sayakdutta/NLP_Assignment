Dear Dr. V. Kaminsky and other Enron?s colleagues,

I have a good time for the significant discussions with you. I believe that th
e collaboration with Enron and TOSHIBA-PIC brings many benefits to every field
. Now, the activity of financial technology moves to the field of energy tradi
ng. If our collaboration becomes active, the financial technology will progres
s more drastically. Enron and PIC have many key technologies for the success o
f our collaboration.

Thank you for your deep understanding of Boltzmann model and your hospitality.


Best regards,
Yuji Uenohara
TOSHIBA-PIC
