Dear Samantha,

My associate, Steve Leppard, sent me a message about a conversation he had with you 
regarding books on quantitative aspects of trading different commodities.

I shall be very glad to talk to you about different approaches we can take (books ranging from
a very general introduction to different commodity markets to highly technical treaties) and
about the contribution  Enron could make.

You can take a quick look at the book published by Risk magazine, "Managing Energy
Price Risk", 2nd edition. This collection of papers was probably the best selling book Risk published
so far. It is a good starting point to a conversation about different  options you might consider.

Please, feel free to give me a call. My direct number is 713 853 3848.
