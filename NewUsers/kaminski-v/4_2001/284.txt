Christie,

This is one of the communications regarding Rice CFOs conference.

Andy requires some gentle persuasion.

Hi Vince,

I may have missed something, however don't believe I have received any
communication recently from Andy Festow about this upcoming May 4-5 corp.
fin. conference.  I hope he is still planning to come, yet I don't know as
of now.

I have Andy penciled in as a participant on a "panel" that is discussing
equity dilution from stock option compensation (the role of panelist should
require little, if any, preparation time).   Of course, I want Andy to
come, however he is concerned about his ability to attend, I probably
should identify another person or two to serve on the panel.

Dave.
