Hi Vince,

Hope this mail finds you well. Sorry to be bothering you with this, but my 
application to Rice is due by April 6,2001 and I need to submit all 
application material including the recommendations. Request you to kindly 
fill in the reco form and have Shirley send the same directly to Rice with a 
cover indicating that the same is for me.  

I understand that you have a very busy schedule, but would appreciate if you 
could fill in this form by the deadline and send the same to the B-School 
directly.

I continue to relish the experiences from my visit with the research group 
and look forward to working with the group again.

Regards,
Anshuman
