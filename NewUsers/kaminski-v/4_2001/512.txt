I'd be happy to, Vince.

Who should I speak to about making a booking, or is West U open to anyone w=
ho just shows up to play volleyball there? As for the lunch, is there a par=
ticular catering service or restaurant we order from? Would Shirley be able=
 to give me these details?

Tom,

We play as a group from time at the West U location.

Would you like to take lead and organize another outing.
Family members are invited and we order a BBQ lunch
following the game.

The message below relates to a volleyball tournament that will be held at t=
he end of the month. If you are interested in being part of a Research Grou=
p team, please let me know ASAP, so that we could form a team and even prac=
tice (!?) a time or two. I am told that most of the teams entered are in th=
e "social" category - we would be going to have fun, not a serious competit=
ion! Please note also that the teams entered must be coed, so we need Ladie=
s as well as Gents.

Thanks,

Tom
