Randall,

The person supporting EBS in the Research Group is Martin Lin.
I shall ask him to give you a call and will be glad to join you at the meeting
with Martin.

Dear Vince:

I was referred by Rita Hartfield of EBS. I am the Director of Marketing for 
the Digital Content Services Team (David Cox, Frank Bay, et. al.). We are 
identifying and evaluating features and functions that will be a part of the 
next generation Entertainment on Demand (EoD) product.

The e-mail I've excerpted below contains two links to a company that offers a 
"preferencing" service that we know is quite popular and important to 
entertainment consumers. I have some questions abouts the statistics, 
sampling methodology, explained variance etc. of the model that The 
StyleLogic group employs.

Do you have a member of your team that could assist on this project? 

Thanks for your help,

Randall Hicks
