Molly,

Thanks a lot. I am very glad about Jinbaek.

Vince



I've talked several times with Scott Gerson of the Focus Group about the list 
of candidates he has presented to you.  He says that Sriram is "ready to go", 
but that the other NY guys are "kinda iffy".  He did say that they may become 
more interested in Houston if they don't receive NY job offers within the 
next week or so. We have scheduled Sriram to come in to interview with the 
group on Thursday, 4/19, beginning at 9:00 am with you, Vince.   I will keep 
you posted if I hear anything more from Scott.

Spoke with Jinbaek Kim today, and he is very excited about the offer to do a 
summer internship with the Research Group.  We will get his offer letter out 
to him tomorrow, but he has indicated a definite verbal acceptance.

I'll be in tomorrow, but off Friday.  Please call me with any questions you 
might have.

Thanks,
Molly
