Brian,

No problem.

Vince, I finally joined a team that only had two members.  It looks like our
paper will only be about 13 to 15 pages.  We were wondering that since our
team is less than half the size of some of the other teams, if you could
possible relax the length requirement?

Thanks,
Brian Nelson





Brian,

The last class + plus a few days (depending on when I have
to submit the grades).

Mr. Kaminski,

I had an interview last Thusday in Dallas and could not attend class.  Did
you set a project deadline?

Thanks,
Brian Nelson
