Stinson,

He keeps bugging us about it. 
Any thoughts what we should do?

Hi Vince -

Hope all is well with you.

Sharad hasn't had time to evaluate our Willow Tree or Monte Carlo software
since the middle of last year.  Is there somebody else that could do it?

Please let me know who I should send the evaluation to.

Best Regards,
