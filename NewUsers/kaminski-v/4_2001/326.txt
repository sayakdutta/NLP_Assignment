Vasant,

I have approved Iris' request for SPSS (reluctantly).
It makes sense for her to use SPSS when she works 
for London (it would require more effort
to move data bet the systems than the cost
of SPSS).

I don't like proliferation of systems, however.

Hi Vince,

 is it fine to approve SPSS for Iris (cost $499), or should we ask that she 
use SAS, for which we already have a site license?  The only reason to use 
SPSS is because I think London people use it (I am not sure about this).
