Vasant,

I gave my slot to Zimin.

We are organizing a group with RAC to send a few people 
to this conference at a discount to full cost.

Hi Vince,

 did not we get a free guest registration for this conference since you were 
speaking?  I ask because I just got an expense approval request from Lance 
for about $2300, which is the registration cost of the conference.  I just 
wanted to check with you first before I approve.

Thanks,
Vasant
