Martin,

Works for me.

Shirley, Please, put on my schedule.







The five of us will be riding together for the May 2 short course.  Perhaps 
leaving at 9am would be best to give sufficient time for lunch before the 
course.  Would an estimated departure from Enron at that time be suitable to 
everybody?

Martin
