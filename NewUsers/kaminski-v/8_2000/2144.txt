Shelly,

I shall not accept anybody for a rotation without a prior interview.

Li was scheduled to meet with me last Thursday but  she never showed 
up. She did not call to cancel or to apologize for not showing up.
I have not seen her resume. 

Please, assume she is not rotating into my group till further notice.

Vince
 


   
	
	
		



Jeff,

Just wanted to confirm that Li will be placed in Vince Kaminski's group.  
Vikas has been placed in ENA Middle Market reporting to Craig Breslau.  
Please contact me at 3-4584 if you have any questions.  Thanks for your help!!

Shelly, 

Hunter spoke with Li today and agrees that her first rotation should be in 
Vince's group doing modelling, etc.  This will give her the broadest 
experience for a first rotation.  I'm sure the other person in question, 
Vikas, will do very well in Hunter's group.  

Thanks for your help.

Jeff
