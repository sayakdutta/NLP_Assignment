Giuseppe,

It's great. What about Saturday, around 4:00 p.m.?

I shall send you the directions to my house.

Vince, 

Next weekend (Sunday 27) I will be in Houston. I would be happy to pay a 
visit to you and your family in the Woodlands, on the day and time you 
prefer. I am very flexible in my daily schedule, and I am always honored to 
make acquaintance with a Stanford scholar...

Regards,

 Giuseppe
