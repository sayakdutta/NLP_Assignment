Dear Mark and Vince
 
I know that it has been very trying for us all, but  I do believe that we have got there in the end! I have attached a copy of the  programme that I will send to the printers. Unless I hear from you  by tomorrow my time, I will ask the printer to proceed with the information  that I have.
 
We can discuss the exact specifics and logistics in  the near future. I will of course be in touch again and will send you both  copies of the brochure when it is printed. 
 
In the meantime, can I please have the following  information over the next few days (I know my demands are endless, but at least  they are no longer pressing!):
 
- a professional CV, around 70 to 100 words should  be fine
- your address
 
I thank you in advance for your co-operation and  look forward to working with you both on GARP 2002.
 
Kind regards
 
Andreas
