Zimin,

Yes, it wasn't easy. Thanks for stepping in on such a short notice.

Vince,

Our presentation at the SMS panel went very well. The audience asked quite a few questions.
Mac from U Penn invited me for lunch and dinner tomorrow to talk about more in details about real option valuation.

Enron was mentioned a few times in
Gary Hamel's speech in very positive way.

I heared Enron is under Sec investigation. I can imagine your
Monday meeting was not easy.
