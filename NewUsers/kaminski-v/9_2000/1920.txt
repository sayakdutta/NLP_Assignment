John,

I shall be in Paris and London next week. We can schedule a call sometimes 
next week. I shall ask my assistant to send you my itinerary. A late call 
(Paris time)
would work for me. The time difference is 6 hours. This would mean a call
sometimes around 3 - 4 p.m. our time.

Please, indicate which day works best for you.

Vince








Vince,

Good morning.  Unfortunately I'll be in Milwaukee visiting Harley-Davidson
about a book revision project both Thursday and Friday.  How about early
next week.  I appreciate your patience with me.  When you suggested a time
last week I was "unprepared" and embarassed to call and expose my
ignorance.  Since then I have re-read the Enron Gas Services case and have
a pretty good feel for how you guys have melded the physical and financial
sides of the business.  The other theme that I have heard many Enron
speakers use is the "de-regulation" of markets.  This certainly played a
factor in the power business and presumeably was behind the water business.

If you'll let me know when it's convenient to call next week I'll have some
notes put together.  I'm teaching a class for a colleague on Monday so
anytime after that is great.

Thanks and hope you had a pleasant trip.

John

p.s.  I saw that the Univ of New Orleans has an Energy Finance endowed
chair for a financial economist open.  If you ever decide to move back to
the life of poverty of an academic I would love to recommend you for such a
post.
