Sherri,

Our friends at the University of Texas are planning a conference on energy
economics and finance in February of next year. They would like very much to 
have 
Jeff Skilling as a keynote speaker. 

Given our good, long-term  relationship with UT,  I would recommend
that Jeff speaks at this conference I talked to Prof. Ehud Ronn
a few times about this conference and  I think that this will be 
an excellent forum to present Enron's accomplishments and
agenda for the future.

I shall send a separate message to Jeff about this request.

Vince

Rick / Vince,

Good morning.

In my 9/14 e-mail, I advised you of the practitioner-industry CEFER (Center
for Energy Finance Education and Research) Conference we are planning for
Spring 2001.  As you know, we would like to invite Jeff Skilling to be the
keynote speaker at the Thur. evening dinner.  The following day's four
topics consist of Risk management, Deregulation, Real options, and
International/globalization.  The majority of invitees would be
(predominantly U. S.-based) energy-industry practitioners, as well as
several academics.

Given lead time issues in these matters, we have reserved hotel rooms in
Austin for Feb. 22, 2001.  Could I ask you to ascertain Jeff Skilling's
availability for that evening?

Thanks,
Ehud Ronn
