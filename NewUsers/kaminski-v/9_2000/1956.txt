Martin,

What about 8:00 a.m. tomorrow (Wed) morning.

Sorry for the rescheduling.  Shalesh is unable to make it until late this 
afternoon.  Since what we have is informal and not urgent, perhaps we can 
catch you for a few minutes just sometime late today or tomorrow before you 
leave.  Otherwise, it can wait until you return.

Thanks,
Martin

Martin,

Let's try bet 1 and 2:30.

Shalesh and I wanted to meet with you briefly, but this morning's timing 
isn't working out.  Are you available this afternoon, sometime after 5pm?

Thanks,
Martin
