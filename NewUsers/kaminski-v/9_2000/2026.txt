Li,

Let my try to excavate some of  them.

Hi, Vince,

How are you doing? This is Li Sun, I have a question regarding OAS 
(Option-Adjusted Spread) model, according to my reading, it is a very 
powerful and practical model for dynamic balance sheet management and it is 
exactly what we want to do for the enterprise-wide risk management. 
Unfortunately OAS is only explained in a broad sense, I wonder whether I 
could get some recommendations on where I can get more detailed information 
regarding this topic. Many thanks!

Li
