 

Dear Vince,
	That sounds great.  My office is in the Engineering Science
Building, ENS502.  This building is near the center of the block
bounded by 24th, 26th, San Jacinto, and Speedway.  If you are parking
at parking garage 1 (PG1), you should walk out onto San Jacinto,
look for 24th, go East on 24th, pass the Service building then turn right up
a
wide sloping driveway.  The side entrance of my building is straight ahead
and to the left slightly.
	My office number is 471-5879.
	I look forward to seeing you on Monday.
	Ross

   Dear Vince,
      I wanted to follow-up with you about your visit to
   UT that I understand is scheduled for September 10.
   If convenient, I would very much like to meet you
   sometime during that day.
      Regards,
           Ross
