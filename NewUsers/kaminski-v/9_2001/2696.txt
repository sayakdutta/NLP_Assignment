I interviewed this fellow, who I understood worked for EES last year, and I found him to be very competent and the Economics Chairman thinks he walks on water.  He interviewed for a spot in Gas Load Forecasting but Shawn Chmil is passing on him due to lack of actual experience in load forecasting.

If anyone needs a very bright (top of the class) economics/stat candidate then please call me, ext 39464.
