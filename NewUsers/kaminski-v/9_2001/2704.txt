Larry,

I shall be glad to join you and Prof. Goldenfeld for dinner.

Vince

 

Guys:
         Professor Nigel Goldenfeld of the University of Illinois, [who
also runs an options pricing software firm, NumenX, with Professor Mitchell
Feigenbaum of Rockefeller University] will be visiting the University of
Houston Physics department Monday and Tuesday September 24-25.  Goldenfeld
arrives on Monday afternoon, and we were wondering if there would be any
interest in anyone there going out to dinner with us on Monday evening
(Sept. 24).  His Colloquium will be given at 3:00-4:00 PM (rather than the
normal 4:00-5:00 PM) on Tuesday afternoon in room 634 SR1 on our campus,
but at present it is on Soft Condensed Matter Physics, and I don't know if
he will say anything about his work in "Econophysics."  He has also been a
pivotal person in starting an "Econophysics" program at Illinois.  You can
either let me know or get in touch with Mike Gorman, who is coordinating



                                                 Larry
