Ron:

I added to your spreadsheet the valuation of the combined Peregrine and Shortfall restrictions using an approach that Vassant and I discussed yesterday. 
It assumes: 
	1) Below $50.00 Shortfall will have restrictions on the whole number of shares (18MM shares); 
	2) Above $76.00 Peregrine will be fully rstricted.
	3) Between $50.00 and $76.00 Peregrine will bear a restriction proportional to (S-50)/(76-50) on 18MM shares and 
	   the Shorfall takes the restriction on the remaining shares.
Let's fix some time today to discuss the approach and results.

 

Thanks

Paulo,
Attached is the option valuation model that I put together.  Also, the high end number for the Peregrine/Shortfall forwards range is actually $75.89, rather than the $76 which I gave you.  Thanks again for the assistance.
