Joe,

I have distributed all the copies we got from the publisher.
You can buy one through Marge Nadasky,
and get a discount as an Enron employee, or
directly form RISK through Amazon.

Mr. Kaminski,

I am reading the Managing Energy Price Risk book that you helped write and put together.  As I have been reading it, a fellow trader has been inquiring about how to obtain one.  Would you know how we could get a couple of copies?  Also, if you know of any other good energy risk management books, please let me know.  Sorry to bother you with this but I figured I would ask the expert.  Thanks.
