Billy,

We can give Bobby a call and carry out a preliminary interview over the phone.
I am always a bit suspicious when I see somebody trying
to leave a very good company after a relatively short time.

Vince,

This person looks "scary smart", and when I see that, I always think of you.  Please let me know what you think.

Hope all is well with you,
Billy

Bobby,

Thank you for your interest in Enron.  I've copied Traci Warner who leads recruiting for our program.  Traci or someone from her team will follow up with you.

Regards,
Billy Lemmons

 

Billy:

I hope all is well.  Per our discussion today, provided as an attachment are
my cover letter and resume.

Kind Regards,
Bobby Demissie
