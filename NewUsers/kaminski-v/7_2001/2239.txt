> 2001-2002.
> We are in the process of making preparations for the upcoming "Tiger Team"
> program. Last year we held focus groups to evaluate the quality of our
> program. One suggestion of these groups was better facilitation of the
> matching process between students and hosts. To achieve that end we
> request your assistance.

> We are asking for a verbal commitment to host a Tiger project no later
> than mid-July. No project scope needs be identified at that time, just a
> commitment to work with the program. We have experienced high sponsor
> demand and our resources are constrained. We don't want to reject projects
> because we lack the necessary resources. And, we want to identify our
> project hosts to students as early in the school year as possible. We feel
> this will allow students to better integrate the FAP experience into their
> recruiting efforts. It will also allow us to better match faculty
> expertise (especially institutional) with hosts.
> As an incentive to help us improve the FAP experience, we ask our
> returning hosts for the same contribution as last year - $10,000. This
> amount does not cover our variable costs, though we believe we offer hosts
> great value in terms of product output and recruitment opportunities.
> However, after July we will need to increase our requests for
> contributions to help cover these costs. While we realize that it is often
> difficult to forecast changes to operational, organizational and budgetary
> requirements, we ask that you take this factor into consideration. Please
> notify us of your decision to participate by email at

> I will forward you more detailed information and a calendar for the
> academic year with critical dates and deadlines for hosts. As you will
> see, we have "moved-up" our deadlines relative to last year to help us
> better facilitate the host-student matching process. Our staff also asked
> for extra time to allow faculty to have more input into the project's
> scope earlier in the process. Our focus groups suggested both students and
> hosts would benefit from this. Should you have any questions or concerns
> before then, please feel free to contact me.
> Thank you for your interest in helping the Wharton School achieve its
> educational mission. I look forward to working with you in the future
