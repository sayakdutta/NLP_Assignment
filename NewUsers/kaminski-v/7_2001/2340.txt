Gentlemen:
	Lance did a very good job last Friday presenting
his ERCOT work to the people here at the University of 
California Energy Institute.
	Severin Borenstein invited us to put the paper on
the UCEI website as a POWER working paper when we get it
finished.  I think this would be a very good idea.
What do you think?  Of course, we can (simultaneously)
submit it for publication to IEEE PES.
