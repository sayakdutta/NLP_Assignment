Just wanted to let you know how much I enjoyed your talk (and dinner
conversation!).  In fact, the buzz after your presentation was to the
effect that you gave one of the best industry/academic talks.

Please know that you have an open invitation to visit us.  You have my
email address and my office phone number is 404-894-2327.    I look forward
to hooking up with you again in the future.

Steve

p.s. If at all possible I would appreciate receiving any information
(reprints, etc.) that you feel would help us learn about the
industry.  Also, you mentioned a book that you said would be the best
introduction, but I forgot the name.  Thanks again.
