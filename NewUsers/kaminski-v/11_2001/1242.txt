Gayle,

I got home quite late last night. Here is the title of the presentation:

Volatility of Energy Prices in the US Markets. Implications for Market and
Credit Risk Management.


Vince


 


Vince, NACM tells me all they need to approve CEUs is an outline, so that's
all we need.



November 14)


Vince, I know you must be very busy given the recent press. Hopefully, this
has not changed your ability to speak to the Houston Energy Group.  The
title of your presentation is needed to include on the meeting notices.  If
you can provide a copy of your presentation, NACM will count this toward the
attendees continuing education units.  Not all speakers have something to
provide, but if you do and you don't mind sending it, it is certainly
appreciated. To get the presentation approved for CEUs, the info is needed
as soon as possible. Please advise.
Thank you.

   Gayle,

   November 15 presentation is still on my calendar. I shall be leaving
   later
   that
   day for our annual  management conference in San Antonio (around 3:30
   p.m.).
   My recollection is that the presentation is from11:30 till 1:00 so I
   should
   have plenty of time to get to the airport.

   Please, feel free to invite guests from other industries. I shall send
   you
   the title of the presentation  from home tomorrow morning.

   Shirley Crenshaw, my assistant, will send you my bio.

      Vince, I want to be sure the Houston Energy Group is still on your
      calendar
      for Wed, Nov 14.  The National Association of Credit Managers (NACM)
      main
      Houston office has asked if we could invite credit managers from
   other
      industries to attend your session.  I certainly would like to do so.

      Can you send me the title of your presentation to be included in the
      meeting
      notices?  It would also be helpful if you could send me a bio, so
   that I
      can
      introduce you Properly.
      Thank you very much.

         Thank you for agreeing to speak for the HEG, an industry group
   within
         the
         National Association of Credit Management.  "Price Volatility in
   the
      US
         Power Markets" is a topic of great interest to many of us. The
      meeting
         time
         is 11:30 - 1pm and the November meeting is scheduled to be in the
   El
         Paso
         building.  I will confirm details with you as the date approaches
   to
         confirm
         that the room has the equipment you will need for your
   presentation.
         Please
         mark your calendar.  We look forward to seeing you then.
