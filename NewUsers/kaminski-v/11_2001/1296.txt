Here is the original version of the joke I tried to make at yesterday meeting.

I've never been much of a Handy Man. I decided to order the new Time
Life series of Do-It-Yourself books. The first book was titled, "How to Fix
the Garbage Disposal." Though I followed all the instructions to the best of
my ability, and spent many long hours, I never did get the darn thing
repaired. Fortunately, the next book in the series was titled, "How to eat
with a HOOK!!!!"

Let's have a good day!
