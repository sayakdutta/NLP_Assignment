Julie,

Thanks for thinking about us. I shall send you some E-mail addresses from home.

Vince,
I realise that you don't have time for email or anything these days.   I just wanted to say that I'm very sorry to hear about everything that is going  on at Enron.  I hope that you are OK?  
 
I understand that Enron Europe is pretty much ending  business tomorrow, except for Enron Metals.  It's all very  shocking and unbelievable.  Just to let you know, and maybe it will benefit  someone, we will be looking to hire someone to head some things up for us in  London.  So if you know of anyone who may be jobless over here, feel free  to have them contact me, or send them the attached draft job  description.      
 
Please stay in touch and best of luck to you.
 
Sincerely,
Julie Brennan
