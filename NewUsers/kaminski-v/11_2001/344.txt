Vasant,

Makes sense to cancel.
Vince




Hi Vince,

I would like to reply to this and cancel my planned attendance at the Wharton meeting.  Please let me know if you would like me to do otherwise.

Thanks,
Vasant

You will find attached the agenda for the Advisory Committee Meeting on December 6-7 at Wharton, together with a map for the location of our optional dinner at La Terrasse Restaurant on December 6 (cocktails beginning at 6:30) and our Meeting at the Terrace Room of Logan Hall on December 7 (beginning at 9 a.m.).  You will also note in the Agenda a set of questions that we will be using to stimulate discussion in our Small Group discussions.  We would appreciate your having a look at these in preparation for the Meeting.

We look forward to seeing you at the Meeting.  If you have any questions in the interim, please do not hesitate to contact me.
