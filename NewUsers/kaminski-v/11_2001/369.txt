Looks good. Please cc Anne Labbe.

Good morning everyone:

We have been asked to forward the following information and instructions to you:

	PLEASE DO NOT TAKE ANY FLOPPY DISCS HOME WITH YOU. 
	PLEASE DO NOT SEND ANY TECHNICAL INFORMATION BY EMAIL
	OUTSIDE THE COMPANY OR TO YOUR PERSONAL E-MAIL ADDRESS.

The above will be grounds for immediate termination if you are caught leaving with the
discs or found to be sending technical information to others outside of Enron.

If you have special circumstances or personal information you need to take, please
consult with Vince before sending the information or taking it home on a floppy.

Thanks!

Shirley
