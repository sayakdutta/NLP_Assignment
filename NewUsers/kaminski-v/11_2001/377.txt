Shalesh,

It may be too late but file an expense report for it.

Vince,

I know that we are short on cash but I had been taking GMAT classes, which I paid for thinking that I would be reimbursed by the program, however, that has now changed.  Is there any way that I could be reimbursed for it at this point.  Please let me know.  Thank you very much for your help.
