Great.  Why don't you plan on getting here by 3:00 p.m. (or sooner).  We'll
do a little seminar at 4 for the faculty (perhaps outlining your thoughts
on the paper we are preparing).  We'll do the class 6-7:30 or so (I'll get
you to your hotel for I teach until 10 pm).  Then we'll put in time Tue
working on the paper.
