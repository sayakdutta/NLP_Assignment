Well Vince ,

The group has responded and ready for action.
Vince , we would like to take Mike to Happy Hour
for Boss's Day on the 16th of Oct.

So if it is okay with you may we do so?

I am aware that you will be out on this particular
day however , I would also like to ask anyone in
the Research Group to please join us as we celebrate
with Mike.

fyi  : nothing fancy just a few drinks , laugher and conversation.


                                                                   Thanks
