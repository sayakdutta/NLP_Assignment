Jeff,

FYI. We completed the review of the LNG model.
The copy of the review is available if you want to take a look at it.

The review of Eric Groves' LNG Model spreadsheet has been completed.  No 
independent model was available for use in the comparison; however, the model 
appears complete and accurate in representating all important cost and 
revenue elements.

If this financial model is coupled with a optimization model for planning 
ship usage in the future, additional variables may be needed to represent the 
variability of trip times, weather factors, etc.  A reference describing 
these possible additions was provided.
