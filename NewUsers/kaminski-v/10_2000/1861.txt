Sam,

I forgot about Maureen's article being available. Please, use your judgement 
what to publish.
It  depends on whom you can catch first.

Vince,

I'll try to contact her this morning.  Also, Zimin's note with his article 
said you want to print his Technical Corner today.  Do we not want to 
conclude Maureen's article with today's issue?

Sam,

We should profile Kirstee who is on rotation from London Office.
