Cantekin,
Dolores Muzzy forwarded your e-mail.  I apologize for not answering sooner 
but I have been travelling.

Unfortunately, the  terms of the Associate Program compensation package are 
not negotiable.  We have reviewed our terms and believe we are competitive 
with our peers.  I have spoken with Vince Kaminski who will be calling you to 
discuss.

Given that it has taken 6 days to respond to you, if you are still 
considering Enron's offer of employment I will extend your deadline until 
October 24th.

Please call if you have any other questions.  

Sincerely,
Charlene Jackson
