Ed,

I shall be available on both days. What about Wednesday,
July 12, between 1:30 and 4:00. Please, let me know
what time would work for you.

It will be nice to see you again.

Vince

P.S. By the way, did you have a chance to take a look at the EOL?











Dear Vince,

I will be returning to Houston during the  week of July 10.

ESAI and Weather Services International have launched -- after more than 18
months of R&D --  our service, called Energycast Power Trader and Energycast
Gas Trader, for power traders in Nepool and PJM. I would be happy to review
the service with you as well as take you on a tour of our web site. Are you
available on July 12 - 13?

Sincerely,

Ed Krapels
