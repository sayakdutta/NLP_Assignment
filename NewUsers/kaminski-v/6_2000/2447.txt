Thanks for your help on content for EOL phase 2.

An additional piece of content that we are trying to include in our scope is 
an options calculator.  This would be an interactive tool to teach less 
sophisticated counterparties about options.  We would like to collaborate 
with someone in research to refine our approach (and make sure we're using 
the right formulas).  Who should we contact in research for this?

Attached is a mock-up of what we have in mind...
