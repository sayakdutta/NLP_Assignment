Hi Vince,
?
Just a friendly reminder that the hired guns are  making their way up to 
Houston to visit with you and Grant.
?
I was reading the promotional material for the EPRM  conference here in July. 
I wanted to invite you to dinner at my apartment on the  evening between the 
main conference and the post-conference seminars (18th  July). We have a 
pretty spectacular view of the Harbour here that you might  enjoy.
?
Best regards.
?
Chris.
