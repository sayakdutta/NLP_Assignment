Kate,

Not yet. I will know sometimes in August - September.

Hi Vince,
 
I just thought I'd check in to see if you had resolved  your space issue for your analysts.  If so, I would love to send you some  people to consider for your team!  
 
Hope your summer is going well and that you are surviving all  the rain!  I recently spent a week rafting through the Grand  Canyon...an adventure I would highly recommend.
 
Hope to hear from you!
 
Regards,
