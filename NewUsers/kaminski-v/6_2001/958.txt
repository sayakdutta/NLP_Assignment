Ian,

I shall come to Wharton on Thursday, June 14,
meeting with Howard Kunreuther.

I shall ask my assistant to forward you my itinerary.
I shall also register for the October Conference.
Thanks for reminding me.

Vince

A couple of months ago you agreed to serve on a panel on real options that Rita McGrath at Columbia had assembled.
We have been informed that you have not registered for the conference - in SFO October 21 to 24

When are you due at Wharton again?
