Bill,

Yes, I am coming to Boston.
Look forward to meeting you there.
My son has not made any decision yet.
I am enclosing his resume: please, let
me know what you think.

Hi Vince -
I wanted to check on a couple of items following our discussions earlier
this year: 1) has your son decided where he will work? and 2) will you be in
Boston for the Risk 2001 conference?
Development is moving along at a good pace here at Opt4.
Best regards,
Bill Balson
