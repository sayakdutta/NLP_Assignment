Thanks.
We shall give her a call and talk to her.

It seems, however, that she has no
relevant quantitative background  and
no experience in finance.

This is the person that I mentioned to you yesterday during the EGM staff meeting.  Give me a call should this be a person you would be interested in (x30938).  SHD.

 

Tony:

As discussed please find attched the resume of Marilyn Mielke.  As you can see she has done some heavy quantitive work within her field of research.  Please note her role as the first sole female on board a US navy ship where she  developed a propulsion system maintenance scheme. 

Thank you.
