Thanks

Vince,

I am sorry to send this late.
I had to finish a report for DealBench team yesterday,
and read papers and prepare slides for the meeting scheduled tomorrow 2PM.
Because I thought those work has to be done first,
I didn't put the priority to the summary report.

Attached is the summary report.
However, I hope I have more time to double check this.

I'll do the proofreadding, and send this again,
after the presentation tomorrow, 
together with the summary report of tomorrow's presentation.    

I am sorry for this again.
