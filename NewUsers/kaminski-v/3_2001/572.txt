Derivatives. I am interested in obtaining a copy of the following items:

1) Your presentation "Current Challenges in Modeling Power Price Volatility"
at the session on Price Volatility & Probabilistic Methods in the Energy
Markets.  (http://www.informs.org/Conf/SanAntonio2000//TALKS/MD29.html)

2) Your chapter "The Challenge of Pricing and Risk Managing Electricity
Derivatives" in the book 'The US Power Market', Risk Publications.

I would appreciate it if you could send me a soft/hard copy of the same.
