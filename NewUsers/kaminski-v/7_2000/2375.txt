Lloyd,

No problem. I wanted to make sure that everybody realizes how 
detailed-oriented our tasks are
and that we have to be in direct communication with our counterparties.

Vince,

I certainly think Anjam & Tanya should visit NY, but I simply had a concern 
that some of the questions being asked had already been covered by Anjam / 
myself and Andreas but had somehow not been communicated.

My message was not intended to convey any another impression.  I've also now 
spoken with Anjam & Tanya and clarified this.

regards

Lloyd

Lloyd,

Speaking from experience, I think that it's critical for Tanya and Anjam to 
visit MG in New York
and establish direct relationship with technical people. Merging two risk 
management systems
requires handling many very technical issues and face to face discussions 
between IT and quants
 will be very helpful.

Tanya,

I think most of your queries can be dealt with on the phone - I'll be at MG 
with Andreas today and we'll call you.   Most of these points have already 
been covered with Anjam in any case.  I'm also attaching a file downloaded 
from Mercur (MG's risk aggregation system) showing monthly total positions 
for each metal in each entity.  You can fairly easily create tables and graph 
what you want to see.  We can talk today about getting a full deal download.

Regards

Hi Andreas,

Here are the issues we would like to discuss on our Thursday meeting in NY:

1. Inputs for options valuation, in particular the origins of volatility 
curves;
2. Information on exotic options structures (existing & potential);
3. The data flow (are we going to get data from London or NY).
4a. Storage of positions information at  MG. How to extract the positions 
info from
MG database into spreadsheets.
4b. Existing positions structure for each metal.
5. Introduction to concentrates trading business, key personnel.

Best Regards,

Tanya & Anjam
