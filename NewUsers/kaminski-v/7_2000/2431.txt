Vince, I know we've run by each other a couple times but I haven't had a real 
chance to talk with you.  I just wanted to let you know how my summer is 
progressing, and it's going well.  I'm sitting on 29 now, with CTG in the 
Coal Group.  I'm always glad to see some familiar faces from Research and 
would love to visit with you.  I'll try to drop by and catch you next week 
sometime, if you're here.

I hope you have a great weekend.  I'm getting together with a group of 
friends this coming Monday and going to see a baseball game at Enron Field on 
the 4th.  It should be fun, even though the Astros will be losing again.


Take care,
Van
