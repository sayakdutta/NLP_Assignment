Dale,

To follow up on my earlier message. Anjam expressed his concern
that Sharad is holding off on our offer. I would consider bumping it up to 
55,000
with a sign-on bonus. We badly need fresh talent.

 I shall be in Australia next week. If you need
any additional intervention from us, please, call Stinson.

Dale,

I was very impressed with Sharad and I think that we should consider paying 
offering him
 o50,000. I am not sure about guaranteed bonus. What do you think?

Hi Dale (& Vince),

I have now gathered everyone's views and the consensus is that we should hire 
Sharad to work with me on front-office pricing and so we should proceed to 
the offer stage.  As you can see his salary is o43,500 currently and he 
appears to have a guaranteed bonus of o25,000 for next year.  He would join 
for >o50,000 from my discussions with Alex Blair, the consultant.  He is very 
interested in Enron, but is also talking to Morgan Stanley.  I discussed with 
Vince, who recommended that Sharad should come in at the same level (rank) as 
Kirstee Hewitt; I would also like to arrange for a direct reporting line to 
me for Sharad.

Regards,

Anjam

P.S. Kate:  I have attached the agencies terms and conditions below:
