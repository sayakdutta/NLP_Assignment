Vince:

Shawn Grady from HR Staffing called me and asked me to schedule interviews 
with the people in Research.  He also mentioned that I should email you to 
find out if you want anyone from any other department to interview Rabi.  I 
am currently scheduling interviews with you, Krishna, Grant, Stinson, Zimin 
and Vasant.  Is their anyone else in Research that you want to interview 
him?  Please get back to me and I will set up the appts.  Thanks.  Anita
