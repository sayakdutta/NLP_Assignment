The lunch with the Baylor professors will be tomorrow, July 12th, at 
Damian's.  The reservation is for 12:00 PM and you are welcome to meet us in 
the lobby around 11:45 or meet us at the restaurant.  Please let me know 
where we should look for you so we don't inadvertently leave you.

I look forward to seeing you all then and thanks for your support and 
participation.
Beth Miertschin

On Wednesday, July 12 Dr. John Martin, Chair of Finance Department, and Dr.

They have asked me to invite all of you to lunch with us on that day so that
