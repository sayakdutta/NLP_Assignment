Is Monday next week OK?

Hello ,

I am on the QA team for the Win2k roll-out.  We need your help in testing 
"ALCAR" in a Windows 2000 environment.

This testing is crucial to the success of converting all PC's from NT4 to 
Windows 2000.  We ask that you make an appointment to come to our offices 
(EB2224B) to preform the test.  It  should not take more than 15 minutes.  
Please e-mail me as soon as possible.

Thanks,
Brenda Cassel
