Mark Lay:  Again, thank you for listening to my concept.  In my search for 
co-foounder/collaborators and
angel investors, disclosing the concept (for lack of a better title now, I 
call the system "LifeTrak")
and formulating a simple, clear picture is not easy.  The attached schematic 
depicts an overview of the
effort.  Part of the diagram hopes to separate the special interests as 
participants and member
organizations so as to be helpful in the public sector with social issues.  
The groups fall into two
natural sectors;  (1) supply generators; and (2) user/service organizations.  
In the middle is the system
and its management that interconnects those benefiting groups and the 
donor/recipient LifeTrak
cardholders.  I can embellish more on these later.  The diagram gives us a 
place to begin discuss and
talking points in order to try to simplify how the concept could be developed 
and supported and where the
revenue model which creates dramatic efficiencies generates management and 
license fee.  I hope we can
get together soon.  Although Vince Kaminski cannot directly contribute due to 
his other commitments, I
have copied him to keep him advised (hoping that he might be able to do more 
at a later date.).  Best
regards, Al Arfsten
