Just a gentle reminder that the day and room location have changed for the 
next Transmission Roundtable meeting due to several of the participants being 
in an all day ERCOT meeting on Tuesday, January 23, 2001.   The next 
Transmission Roundtable Meeting has been changed to Wednesday, January 24, 
2001,and moved to  Conference Room 49C1.  Please notify me whether you will 
attend or not.  I need to know by Friday, January 19, 2001, in order to have 
enough food for lunch.  Thanks.

Regards,

Anita
