Zimin,

I have talked to Alex about it. I don't think that the additional seminars 
will
crowd out the brown bag lunches.

The seminars are really targeted to people who recently joined the group and
have very limited, or zero, exposure to energy markets.

For most members of the group it should be the piece of cake. Brown bag 
lunches
are not that time intensive, except for the speaker.

Plus, we ran out of days  available for lunch meetings.

Vince,
This is a brief summary of last year's Friday Brown Bag Lunch Option Pricing 
series.
We had about 15 lectures, given by the following people:
Grant, Stinston, Vasant, Krishna, Zimin, Maureen, Clayton, Paulo, Chonawee,  
myself, and
some outside speakers. We were able to attract some outside audience as well. 
Overall the response is quite encouraging and we have planned
to continue it. 

In light of the presently scheduled seminars on "Energy Derivatives", it 
seems our Friday
schedule will be too crowded if we have seminars on "Energy Derivatives" on 
two Fridays
and FBBLOP on other Fridays. What's your suggestion? Should we discontinue
the FBBLOP ?

We also have scheduled January 19 for Tom Halliburton's visitor Leon Lasdon 
from UT Austin
to talk on non-linear programming. Should we cancel it?

Best,
Zimin & Alex
