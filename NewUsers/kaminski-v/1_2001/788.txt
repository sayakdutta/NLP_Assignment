Stinson,
?
Here are some options considering what you  have
said:
?
1)? We can do a full week of class from May 7 to  11.
?
2)? The second option is to split the  course over two weeks.
If you cannot possibly accomodate a full week of  training 
then we can try this.? We have done  this before and it has 
worked fairly well.? It would be like:
?
Week 1 (20 hours):? Feb 20-23, Tue-Fri,  12:00 to 5:00
Week 2 (20 hours):?  April 9-12, Mon-Thu, 12:00 to 5:00
?
These are the only two weeks that are available for Venkat  
to teach before May 7th date.? 
?
Please let me know if these would work.? I  look forward to 
hearing from you.?
?
Regards,
?

Siva,???? I will have to  check and see if we can accomodate a 5 day 8 to  
class.??? Also, President's day is a holiday for us, so  we may have to look
at a later  date.

Stinson,

I have attached a file  along with this email
that lists the software needed for our
Java  class.

We would like to do the class from Monday thru
Friday, 8 AM  to 5 PM.? That way we can complete
the class within a?  week.? We are unable to offer
classes in the evenings or for few  hours a week.
We usually teach week long courses for our
other clients  and because of that? we won't
be available.

Currently, we can  do the class from Feb. 19th
through Feb. 23 (that is if you are working  on
Feb 19th, President's day).

I will call? you sometime this  afternoon to talk
further.? Please feel free to reach me if you  have
any further questions in the mean time.

Regards,

-  Siva
