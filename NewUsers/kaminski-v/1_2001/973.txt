Vincent,

I have forwarded the resume to our Analysts / Associate pool with
a recommendation to accept David as a summer intern.

I expressed interest in taking him into my group. He may, of course,
work for a different unit of Enron. It's up to him and I shall not be offended
if he would like to go into trading or deal origination.

Vince
