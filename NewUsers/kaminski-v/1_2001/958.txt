Vince,

Thank you for your prompt reply. We have received your fax earlier this
morning. FYI, we shall be sending you the questionaires by next week as we
are going through the final draft this week. Could you please tell me who
will be joining the discussion during our visit? Thanks.

Regards,

Khairuddin
