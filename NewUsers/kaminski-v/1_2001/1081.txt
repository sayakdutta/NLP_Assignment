Ashley,

Thnaks. I shall attend the reception. I shall ask Shirley to set up a meeting 
with you to discuss 
spring events on campus.

Hello Vince

I wanted to forward the following invitation to you.  We are putting the 
Technologists through an orientation which includes a few days with the 
Analyst program - and the following is one of the events that they have 
scheduled on Jan. 16th.  I wanted to forward to you as more of an FYI since 
we do not have any Cal Berkeley candidates starting on Jan. 8th.  Also - we 
are starting to set some of the events on campus for the Spring - so we 
should probably get together soon.  Please let me know what works best for 
you!

Thanks,
Ashley
