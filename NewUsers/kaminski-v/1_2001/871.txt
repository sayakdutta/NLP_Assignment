Sheridan,

I have just checked with RAC (David Gorte) and we have a green light
to go ahead with the project. I shall you tomorrow to discuss the details.

Vince:

I just wanted to check with you regarding the consulting arrangement we
discussed a couple of weeks ago.

Perhaps, we should start with just a 1 or 2 day contract where I give some
thoughts to the kind of issues that we discussed and come to Houston to
present my preliminary thoughts and possible avenues for additional work.

regards,

Sheridan
