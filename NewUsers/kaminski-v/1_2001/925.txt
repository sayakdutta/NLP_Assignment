Vince:  I am very enthusiastic about your interest and possible
contributions towards a 22nd Century human blood system.  I have
attached a letter that discusses the endeavor.  Please note that it has
a built-in automatic release in the event you need to terminate.  It has
a confidentiality statement as well.  If it is acceptable, please sign
it and fax it back to me at 713 965 2114 at your earliest convenience.
