Clayton,

Great news. I would like to sit down with you, Tom and Stinson and review 
where
we are with  this project. Also, I would like to talk to you about your 
status (finalizing
the transfer to another group).

Dave Delaney called an hour ago. He needed a statistic from EOL that the EOL 
folks couldn't give him (it seems they had a database problem in 1999), and 
the grapevine had it we had the data. Tom Barkley was able to give him the 
data he needed for his presentation, within a matter of 10 minutes or so.
