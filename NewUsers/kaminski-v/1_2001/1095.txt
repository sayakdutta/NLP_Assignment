Vasant,

I have it on my  laptop and I had problems attaching through a docking 
station to
the system.

I shall move it through AOL tonight.

Hi Vince,

 could you forward Benjamin Rogers a copy of that volatility presentation you 
made to the traders last month?  He was one of those attending.

Thanks,
 Vasant
