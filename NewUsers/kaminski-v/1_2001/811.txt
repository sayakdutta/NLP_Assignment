Vince,

First, thank you for the get well gift... It was a pleasant suprise.

Its been a fairly rough time here, with the extra complication of having 
pnemonia on top of the Appendisitus. I've spent most of my stay in ICU so 
have reakk slept since Thursday. My breathing has been of highest concern.

Yeserday, I had my tube removed from ny nose, which was very unpleasant but 
long awated!!

I'm off to the OR this moring to have my open wound stiched up and then I'll 
probably be sent to a generall ward.

Thanks again



Steve
