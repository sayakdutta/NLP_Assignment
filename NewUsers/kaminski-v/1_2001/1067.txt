Sally,

I passed this information along to some of my direct reports for their 
thoughts, and truthfully didn't hear back from anyone and didn't follow up.  
Two years ago, we agreed to be part of a benchmarking study that was done by 
AA's Houston office (interestingly enough, Wes Colwell was the AA partner who 
led this effort) and we had mixed results.  The study was designed to cover 
gas and power.  Despite our involvement in the steering committee, the study 
itself was very, very detailed, such that it was troublesome to complete.  
Jim Fallon at the time refused to submit information on the majority of the 
questions surrounding power, so our survey data for power was not very 
useful.  

I would agree that at this time we will pass on this request.  Thanks for 
passing it along, however.  I would be happy to convey this directly  to the 
person that has contacted you.  Just let me know his/her name and number and 
I will follow through on that if you would like.  

Hope that your holidays was enjoyable and that the new year will be a good 
one for you.  --Sally

Sally,

I gave you some time ago a brochure on this benchmarking study request.
They renewed their request for Enron's participation.

What is your view on this? Do you think the benefits of knowing what's
going on offset the loss due information released and time spent on the 
project.

My recommendation is to forget it.

Vince

Dear Vince,

Peter Nance and I wanted to follow-up our discussion of Enron's participation 
in our benchmarking study.  Have you discussed Enron's participation in the 
project with your colleagues?

Here is a small sample set of metrics that were taken from a comprehensive 
list of over 700 metrics.  The study group will decide which metrics to use.

With EEI's credibility and Teknecon's technical expertise, we intend to 
become the industry standard in benchmarking.  We would very much like to 
have Enron participate in the study.

I would be happy to set up another meeting with you and your colleagues with 
Peter Nance if you think that would be helpful.

Best regards,
