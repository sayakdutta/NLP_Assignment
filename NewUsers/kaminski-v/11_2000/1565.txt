Gentlemen,

We are attaching below a document on Internet Protocol (IP) written by 
Martin.  We hope you will find it informative and provide us with some feed 
back to improve it.  Shalesh is still working on documents for fiber optics 
and storage.  We felt that they were not complete and therefore not ready for 
review.  We hope to have them ready for your review soon.  In the mean time 
we would appreciate any comments you may have about the IP document.  Thank 
you.

Sincerely,

Shalesh and Martin
