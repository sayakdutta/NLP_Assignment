When do you need my signature. I missed the presentation last Tuesday
(I was sick) and would like a day or two to review the product.

Here is the latest trading request:



Specifically it requires the following to get it over the line:

Vince, your concurrence with a simplistic VAR calculation the start - up 
period

Everybody else, your signatures, or agreement to sign via email

In addition, here is the commercial presentation which wil be attached to the 
request on its way to EB5007



Many thanks
DP
