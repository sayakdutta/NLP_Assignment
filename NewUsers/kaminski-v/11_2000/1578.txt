Vince,

I'm here through Tuesday.  My home phone number is 254-757-0852 if you
would like to talk Tuesday evening.  However, I'm in Austin all day and
into the evening on Wednesday and off to New Orleans early thursday
morning.  How about I call you Thursday afternoon from New Orleans?

John

p.s. I just got a case study written by some guys at Darden (U. of Va.) on
Enron that I am copying and shipping off to you.  they have done all the
"heavy lifting" for details so all we need do is determine our focus and
write up our paper.
