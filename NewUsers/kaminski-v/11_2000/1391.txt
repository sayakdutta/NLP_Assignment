Molly,

I think you called his bluff. If he does not fax a copy of his paycheck stub,
we should not talk to him. He never talked to me about  it. If he made a true 
statement
about his compensation, he should have no reservations about sending us the 
confirmation.

Vince:  I left you a voicemail about Charles Shen a week or so ago, but 
wanted to follow up with you.  When I called him to extend our offer to him, 
he expressed surprise at the base salary offer of $110,000, and told me that 
he was currently earning base pay in the amount of $120,000.   I told him 
that the salary figure he had written himself on the application was 
$102,000, but he insisted that he had made an error and that it should have 
been $120,000.   I asked him what base salary he was looking for, and he said 
he would expect at least a 10% increase in his base.   I then told him that I 
was not authorized to make an offer above our initial one, and would contact 
you and get back to him.

I called him later that afternoon and asked him to fax me a copy of his last 
paycheck stub so that we could minimize the confusion about his base pay.  He 
said that he would be happy to do so,  but I never received the fax.  He left 
me a voicemail message during the evening that said he was on vacation and 
didn't have access to the pay stubs,  but would send me a copy when he 
returned.

I have not heard from him since, and wondered if he had contacted you.   If 
not, would you want to get together to discuss our next step?

I'll wait to hear from you,
Molly
