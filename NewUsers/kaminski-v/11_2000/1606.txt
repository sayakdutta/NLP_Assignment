Steve,

Thanks for the invitation. I shall be delighted to join you.
My wife is in California, so it will be just me.

Hi Vince

As you know I'll be celebrating my 40th at the end of this month with a party 
at my house. 

It will be a fairly informal affair with relatives, neighbours and friends 
from work.

The date is the evening of Friday, 1st December (so it doesn't conflict with 
the Enron Party), and I'd like to invite you and your family join us.

If you can make it, please let me know so I can get some idea of numbers (I'm 
currently expecting around 50-60)

regards

Steve
