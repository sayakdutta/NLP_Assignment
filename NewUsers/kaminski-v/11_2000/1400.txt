Hi Vince Kaminski,

Thanks for joining Evite!

With your new Evite Membership, you can:

* Send Invites for your next get-together, track RSVPS, get maps and 
directions, and more:
  http://www.evite.com/compose?li=reg

* Set Evite Reminders to help you remember birthdays, meetings and other 
important dates:
  http://www.evite.com/reminders?li=reg

Caution: May Be Habit-Forming - All the Invites you send or receive are 
stored on your 'Today' page. It's fun to keep checking your Invite as guests 
RSVP and leave comments - once you try it, you'll never go back to email or 
phone tag when you want to get people together!

Remember, all these services are 100% free to you as an Evite Member. To 
access them anytime, simply go to:

The Evite Team
