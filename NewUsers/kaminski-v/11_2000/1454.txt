Dear Research Group ,

As you are aware Thanksgiving is Thursday , Nov.23rd
and is a holiday.

We as Enron employee's will be off both the 23rd and 24th.

Thanksgiving is a day appointed for giving thanks for divine goodness.

After returning to work we will keep the tradition of giving thanks
right here in the work place by celebrating Thanksgiving in the
Thursday's staff meeting 11-30-00.

We will celebrate a act of giving thanks to one another as 
co -workers and member of the same Research Group.

Please look forward to hearing more regarding the Staff meeting 11-30-00

                                              
                                     Thanks
