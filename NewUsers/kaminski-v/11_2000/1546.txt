Good Morning, Vince!

After going over our department list, I believe that, with the exception of a 
part-timer or two, we have covered everybody in the newsletter.  If we have 
recently hired someone who might not be on the list, would you please let me 
know?  Also, if you have a good article from someone that we can use for a 
Technical Corner, we will need that, too.  I'm going to put out a general 
call for TC material today.  Hopefully, we will get several things we can use 
for the coming weeks.

Sam
