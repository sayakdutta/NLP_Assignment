Patricia,

Barbara Pierce did not show up on my list of people asking for a review.
Maybe a glitch in the system.

Thank you for agreeing to interview Barbara Pierce.  Unfortunately we are 
unable to proceed because we have not received all of her evaluations.  Can 
you please fax the evaluation to me at your earliest convenience at (713) 
646-3441 and send the original via interoffice mail to EB1171.

Thanks Again,

Patricia
