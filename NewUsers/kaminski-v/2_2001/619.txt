God grant me the senility to forget the people I never liked 
anyway, the good fortune to run into the ones that I do, and the 
eyesight to tell the difference. Now that I'm 'older' (but refuse to 
grow up), here's what I've discovered:  

1 ?- I started out with nothing, and I still have most of it.  
2 ?- My wild oats have turned into prunes and All Bran.  
3 ?- I finally got my head together; now my body is falling apart.  
4 ?- Funny, I don't remember being absent minded...  
5 ?- All reports are in; life is now officially unfair.  
6 ?- If all is not lost, where is it?  
7 ?- It is easier to get older than it is to get wiser.  
8 ?- Some days you're the dog; some days you're the hydrant.  
9 ?- I wish the buck stopped here; I sure could use a few...  
10 - Kids in the back seat cause accidents.  
11 - Accidents in the back seat cause...kids.  
12 - It's hard to make a comeback when you haven't been anywhere.  
13 - The only time the world beats a path to your door is when you're  
        in the bathroom.  
14 - If God wanted me to touch my toes, he would have put them on my knees.  
15 - When I'm finally holding all the cards, why does everyone decide  
        to play chess?  
16 - It's not hard to meet expenses... ?they're everywhere.  
17 - The only difference between a rut and a grave is the depth.  
18 - These days, I spend a lot of time thinking about the hereafter...I go  
        somewhere to get something and then wonder what I'm here after.  
19 - I ?AM UNABLE TO REMEMBER IF I HAVE MAILED THIS TO YOU BEFORE OR NOT.
