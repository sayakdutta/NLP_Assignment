Vince:  Just to update you:  Mark said that he would like to spend some time 
with you, so he is scheduled to come to Houston on Sunday.   His interviews 
begin at 1:00 pm on Monday, and he will be seeing John Lavorato, Gary 
Hickerson and Stinson.   Jeff Shankman is in Tokyo that whole week, as we 
discussed earlier.    I will give you his itinerary as soon as it is complete.

Please let me know if there's anything else I can do.

Molly
