Dear Dr. Kaminski,
I'm an economist (M.Sc., Caltech, Ph.D., Iowa) who has been working for the
Alberta government for the last seven years on electricity deregulation in
Alberta, Canada. I have been looking for research papers on the measurement
and causes of price volatility in electricity markets.

As a policy maker, I am interested in the implications of government policy
decisions on price volatility. As an economist who has had a hand in
designing the electricity markets here, I am also interested in how the
design of electricity markets and the associated institutions affect price
volatility.

I've found two references to a seminar talk you have given recently at
Berkeley and Carnegie Mellon called "Volatility of Electricity Prices -
Measurement and  Analysis of Underlying Causes." (I've also found a
multitude of references to other work that you've done, but this seemed
closest to what I'm looking for.)

Was there a paper associated with your talk that I could get a copy of? Any
help you can give me on finding information on this topic would be greatly
appreciated.

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,

Sid Carlson
