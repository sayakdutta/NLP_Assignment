Mark,

Thanks. Vince





Vince,

I must apologize.  I have not had time to look over the proposal in any 
detail.  When I first spoke with your friend, it was apparent that he was 
still pre-business plan stage.  He has since sent me some ideas and 
information.  I think the concept has merit, but there are so many political 
issues that I am concerned about the ultimate business viability. 

Give me the weekend to look over the information.

Thanks,
Mark

 

Mark,

Any further thoughts on the blood bank concept?
Please, let  me know if I can be helpful?

Vince
