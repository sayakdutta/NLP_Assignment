David,

It's even better.

Dinner on the 18th works best for me.

I sent your outline to our CFO with my recommendation.
I hope to hear shortly from him.

Vince









Hi Vince,
We have tentatively re-scheduled Philippe Jorion for Monday, March 19.  He
will likely come for dinner on Sunday, March 18 and return to California on
March 19.  Would dinner on the 18th and/or a seminar sometime on Monday the
19th work with your schedule?

Thanks, Dave
