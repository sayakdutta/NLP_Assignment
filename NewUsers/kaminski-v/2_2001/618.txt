Vince
I am an adjunct professor at Rice, working with Wil Uecker in Executive
Education.  With your concurence, I would like to sit in your Energy
Derivatives course. I understand from Wil that there are 38 students
registered for the course.  If you consent, would you let me know what
material I need.
Thank you,
Dennis W. Loughridge
