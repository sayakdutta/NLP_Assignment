Gwyn,

Try to reduce the number of potential candidates to 3, before I shall
get involved.

Also, I contacted HR regarding your promotion. 
The process has started.

Thanks Vince.  I have the resume book from SAIS.  I'd like to start 
contacting them individually telephonically prior to meeting with Maureen.  I 
will begin to contact them and do some initial screening.  Would you like to 
participate in the initial screening?

THanks, -- Gwyn

Vince,

Maureen had mentioned to me a while back that our group had approval to hire 
an junior/full economist.  She then asked me to contact Johns Hopkins SAIS to 
get resumes of possible candidates.  I have completed all this.  But, before 
I begin contacting these potential candidates, I wanted to confirm with you 
that we have the approval to hire another person at the either junior or 
associate economist level.

Thank you.

Gwyn Koepke
