 Dear Dr. Kaminski

 We have talked earlier during your energy class at Rice about career
opportunities in risk management at Enron. If it is possible, I would like
to meet with you and people from your group next week, preferably Tuesday
(May 8). My time is flexible, I could come any time. Other days are also
fine.

 Thank you very much in advance.

 Sincerely,
 Konstantin Kudin
