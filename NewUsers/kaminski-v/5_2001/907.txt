John,

Sorry for the delay in responding to your message (migration
from NT to Windows 2000). My presentation sits on my laptop
and I need an hour to take care of Internet connection. The Power Point file
should be sent to you in a few days.

Dr. kaminski,

I enjoyed the presentation you gave at the SIAM conference this friday and
would appreciate the a copy of the slides that you were using.
Thank you.


Sincerely,

John Ryan
