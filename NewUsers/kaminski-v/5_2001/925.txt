Zimin,

Can you interview him over the phone?

Vince
 

Is there a fit?

Gary




Gary - 

Thank you for the referral.  Obviously, this individual is very intelligent and highly skilled - but I do not see a fit for th e analyst/associate program.  

I will have my group send a letter to him indicating our decision not to bring him in for interviews for the pool.  

I did have one suggestion for you though.  You may want to pass his resume by Vince Kaminski for his review.  Vince has specialized needs and this candidate may be better suited for his group.

Thanks again, 

Traci

 

Traci, attached is the resume of the individual that would like to join Enron.  He is highly qualified, PhD Mathematics.

If there is a fit, let him know.  If not, let him know.

Thanks,

Gary


   



Billy, can you use a PhD from A&M in the A&A program?
