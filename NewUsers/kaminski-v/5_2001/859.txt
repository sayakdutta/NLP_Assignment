Vasant,

We can sponsor a table at the FRIEND level.

Vince, 

EBS has sponsored a $3500 table at the FRIEND level.  You could either do that, or you could do a $1000 table at the MEMBER level --- Enron is already a corporate member.  Either table provides for an acknowledgment in the program.

The $1000 table provides for 10 people, whereas the $3500 table provides seating for 8 people from our side plus 2 student interns placed by IACCGH at local companies will also sit at our table.

Either table would be great (I would not go any higher).  I guess the only difference would be distance of table from the front.

Thanks,
Vasant  

 

Vasant,

We can sponsor one table. What do you think is the appropriate 
level of sponsorship?

Hi Vince,

	Chitra wanted me to check with you to see if you (Enron Research) would be interested in sponsoring a table at the annual gala dinner with the Consul General, and the Indian Ambassador.  People associated with India projects (Sandeep, Krishna, etc) may benefit.  Of course, if you are sponsoring, I would like to be invited.  

	EBS is sponsoring one table, and that is the only Enron participation so far.
