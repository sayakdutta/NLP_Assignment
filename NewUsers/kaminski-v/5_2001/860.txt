Vasant,

We can sponsor one table. What do you think is the appropriate 
level of sponsorship?

Hi Vince,

	Chitra wanted me to check with you to see if you (Enron Research) would be interested in sponsoring a table at the annual gala dinner with the Consul General, and the Indian Ambassador.  People associated with India projects (Sandeep, Krishna, etc) may benefit.  Of course, if you are sponsoring, I would like to be invited.  

	EBS is sponsoring one table, and that is the only Enron participation so far.
