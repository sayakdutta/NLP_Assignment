Reddy,

Thanks for your message. It would be quite difficult to work
with you on telecommuting basis, given the type of
work we do and the extent of integration of our team with the rest of the
company.

I shall be glad to explore with you other forms of
cooperation Please, call me at 713 853 3848.

Dear Dr. Kaminski:

I am interested in working on a part-time, telecommuting basis
(roughly the equivalent of 1 to 2 days a week) for about a year or
two. I can visit as necessary. I am attaching a brief resume.

Is this something that might be of interest to you? Should you have no
opportunities, can you suggest other groups? I look forward
to hearing from you.

Regards
Reddy
