Vasant,

I agree.

Vince




Vince,

	he seems to have mostly equity and fixed income background (and then some credit exposure calculation) with not much credit data analysis experience.  I do not think he would be appropriate for Bryan's group -- he needs a person who tracks market developments and understands fundamental data, and although this guy may be good at modeling, we already have Iris and Amitava doing the modeling and looking at data.  At this stage, I would prefer to hire somebody with direct experience in credit analysis (banking, rating agency).  I am worried that if we get another person without data analysis experience, then Amitava will find himself with two people (Iris being the other one) who are both inexperienced in this area, and he will find himself doing a lot of the work anyway.
	If you want to pursue him, we should probably do a phone interview first.

Vasant,

What do you think?  He may be expensive.
