Vince:

I spoke with Bill Finnoff at Prediction Company this morning.  I mentioned
to
Bill your  position at Enron and the high-quality quant group that you
manage
there.  I told Bill that I had recently had a conversation with you in
which
you expressed interest in speaking to someone at Prediction Company about
their experience with computerized trading; and if possible, to arange for
some consulting.

Bill indicated to me that he probably would not be able to provide
consulting
services, but he is able to have discussions with colleagues in his field.
He said that he would be delighted to talk with you and provide you with as
much relevant information as he could within the Prediction Company
guidlines.

Bill's telephone number is: (505) 984-3123.  The office assistant will have
to connect you to his extension.




Hope this helps.

Larry

P.S.  I have had several conversations with two of the Prediction board
members over the past couple of months.  If this connection would help you,
please let me know, and I'll see what I could arrange.  But, for the
details
of the way things really work, Bill should be an excellent initial contact.

P.S.S.  I thought that I had transmitted this to you this morning, Vince,
but
my e-mail system reported a delivery problem tonight.  So I'll try this
again
now.

P.S.S.  This is the second day that I've not been able to send this e-mail
to you.  I just spoke with Shirley.  She indicated that you are migrating
your e-mail to Outlook, so I should try again.
