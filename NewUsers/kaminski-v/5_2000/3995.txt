Martha,

Thanks. In case you missed an FT article, please take a look at the 
attachment.

Hello!

Attached are two pieces you may find of interest that address
organizational capabilities needed to live the real options story.

The first piece, which I wrote with Laura Martin of CSFB, addresses the
capabilities needed to carry off the Time Warner / AOL merger.  The
second piece lays out some rules for strategy creation -- including the
requisite capabilities -- in a world of uncertainty.

I hope you find these of interest. Feel free to post them on your
corporate intranet or pass on to colleagues.

Regards,
Martha Amram
