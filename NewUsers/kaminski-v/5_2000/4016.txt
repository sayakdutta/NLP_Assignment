Dear Vincent,

Hope all is well across the Atlantic. You may have seen this already but
thought I would pass it on just in case. Also Socgen just pulled off a
weather deal for a Japanease company looking to protect against wind damage
on their flower crop.

Weather is definatly picking up on this side too with more interest every
day.

Hope all is well,
