Stinson,

Let's bring up these two ideas at the meeting with John Bloomer
(to discuss the other product ideas).

If it's new EBS products you're after, how about a real-time bandwidth swing 
contract with automatic exercise?  The customer pays for the minimum 
(baseload) bandwidth they need for their (say) videoconference, with a 
premium on top that automatically buys them extra bandwidth as it becomes 
available from the system.  They are guaranteed a minimum quality they can 
live with, and (more than likely) they get improved quality much of the time 
for a bargain price.

We get to charge for the use of bandwidth that would otherwise be idle.

Steve,

I think personally it's a great idea, though my son, who studies
computer science, poured a bucket of icy water on me. Computers
are becoming very cheap and most companies have already a lot of 
spare capacity on their systems.

But we can always try. We shall take this idea, to the person in EBS 
responsible for the 
new products and ask him to talk directly to you to discuss the details.

EBS is dying to come up with some new products.

Vince, Stinson

Have any investigations been made of the issue of trading (spare) processing 
power?  Such a proposal would have natural synergies with the bandwidth 
business, since the jobs to be processed would need to be piped around, as 
would their results.

Obvious technical and legal problems are:
1.  Standardisation.  (Java?)
2. Security and confidentiality.

Just a thought that's been buzzing around my head for a while.

Steve
