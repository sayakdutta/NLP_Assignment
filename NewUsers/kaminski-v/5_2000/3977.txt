Vince,

Greetings.

1.  Thanks again for hosting the dinner at Power 2000.  Congratulations
also on a thoughtful keynote address, a copy of which I picked up on the
way out of the Conference.

2.  My family and I are leaving on a family trip 5/25 thru 6/4.  Thus, I
would like to reschedule my proposed Houston visit, and presentation of the
"Enterprise-Wide Risk Management" model to Enron's Research Dept., to the
next mutually-convenient date.

Best,
Ehud
