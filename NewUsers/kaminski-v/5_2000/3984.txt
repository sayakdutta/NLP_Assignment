Dear RealPlayer User,

Let's say you have only five minutes to do
the following: Check your online calendar,
add something to a to-do list, send an
instant message, check how your stocks are
doing, and catch up on today's top news
headlines.

Five minutes? Are we crazy? Nope.

With the free Personal Desktop Portal by
InfoSpace, your life will become that much
more convenient and fun. The Personal Desktop
Portal gives you easy, free, and immediate
access to all the things that are most
important to you: Instant messaging, calendar,
address book, speedy search tools, to-do
lists, parental control as well as personalized
news headlines, weather reports, sports scores,
stock quotes, and lottery numbers. And the best
part is that all of these tools are at your
fingertips in a single easy-to-use toolbar on
your desktop.

information that you'll never need? The Personal
