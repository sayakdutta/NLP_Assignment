Nick,

Thanks for your message. Saturday, 11:45 at  the Terman is fine with
me. See you there.

Vince,

Unfortunately, the faculty club is closed on Saturday.

>>>Lorrie, could you please make reservations
for 2 at, say, Spieto's.<<<<

I am looking forward to seeing you on Saturday. Shall
we meet at the Terman ground floor lobby at 11:45?
I think the Packard building is locked on Saturday.

Thanks,

Nick
