Ann,

I shall be glad to help you in any way I can. Please, give me a call
(713 853 3848) to set up a meeting.

I shall ask Shirley to distribute your message to the entire group
and ask for the volunteers who will be interested in discussing
their experience with you.

Vince

 

Vince,
Over the past year and a half, I have been continually impressed with the richly diverse and highly collaborative working environment you created among members of the Research Group.  As you know, I pay attention to "people" issues in my work, and seldom have I observed such a successful and diverse team environment.   
I believe that this experience is worth sharing with others and would like to write about it.  The purpose of the project would be to capture and share learnings related to the dynamics of the Research Group; larger Enron issues would not be included.  The writing would be based on interviews with you and perhaps ten others in the department.  Anything I write would be approved by those who are quoted, and the complete article would be reviewed and approved by you before being shared outside.  I do not expect to receive any financial support for the effort; I have some time now and enjoy doing the kind of effort I'm proposing.  I can show you a sample of similar, previously-published works I've done.  
I realize that these days are already confusing and draining for you all.  On the other hand, this is a good time, perhaps the only time, to capture the wisdom that each of you has gained from this team experience.  If you have interest in my pursuing this idea, would you be available to talk with me further in the next couple of days?
Respectfully, 
Ann Thomas  (Bob Lee's wife)
