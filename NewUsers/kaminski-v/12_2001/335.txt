Praveen,

Thanks for your message. Can we push the lunch till next week, Wednesday
through Friday?  The situation at Enron is still very fluid and I have to be
available on a very short notice. I cannot leave the building for too long.

Vince,

 If your schedule allows it, Arthur and I would be happy to host you for

lunch tomorrow (the seminar is right after lunch), and talk further. Please

let me know.


Best,

Praveen
