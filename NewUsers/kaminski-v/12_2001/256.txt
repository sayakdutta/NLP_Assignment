How are you doing? It was very nice seeing you the other day, and hope everything is fine with you.

It is pretty sad to witness what is happening at Enron, and all you were worried about before is coming true earlier than expected. I wish we should have done more to prevent this from happening.
Anyway, I am planning to leave the country and go back to China as I am only allowed to stay here for at most 60 days after employment termination. Please keep in touch, and if you have chance, please come and visit me in Beijing, it will be my honor to be your tour guide and show you around.
Happy holidays and wish you all the best!
Li
