Angela,

So far, nobody in my group who was asked about Netco, including myself, expressed interest in 
this new company.

Also, one modification of the list since Friday. Paulo Issler quit last week.

Vince Kaminski

 
Cc:	Webb, Jay; Perlman, Beth; Rub, Jenny; Kaminski, Vince J

We have been requested to furnish a comprehensive list of staff still employed and reporting to the individuals listed as Cc's above.  Please e-mail a list to me for dissemination to counsel to potential investors.  Please also indicate whether all these employees are intended for Netco or not.
