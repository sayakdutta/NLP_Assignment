Praveen,

I shall see you at 11:30 tomorrow.

Vince,

	Anytime after 11:30 would be fine for Arthur and me. If you go to
the visitor's booth (on your left as soon as you enter UH), they will have a
token waiting for you so that you can park next to the College. My office is
220-H. Look forward to seeing you tomorrow.

Best,

Praveen
