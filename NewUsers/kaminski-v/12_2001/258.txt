A letter by Thomas R. Kuhn, President of the Edison Electric Institute, was  published by the Wall Street Journal 12/13/01.  Written in response to  "Shock Waves:  Enron's Swoon Leaves a Grand Experiment in a State of  Disarray" (11/30/01), Mr. Kuhn's letter underscored the strength  demonstrated by competitive U.S. energy markets in light of Enron's  financial crisis.  Attached is a copy of this letter.
