I am sorry for this lateness.
I was in Seattle during the last a few days and came back to Atlanta
yesterday.
This coming winter break (Dec. 14 - Jan. 2), I am planning to go back to
my country to spend some time with my family. While I am staying there, I
would like to collect as much as information possible in the internet
traffic area. There are a lot of research going on in Korean
Universities, so I can get clearer idea in my language which can shorten
my research time.
I will call you when I come back to U.S.
Thank you.

Sincerely,

Hee Jung Sim
