Buca di Bepo could not take 34 people tonight so we have moved the dinner to NICK'S PASTA PLACE, 4057 BELLAIRE BLVD., HOUSTON, TX; PHONE:  713-661-0025.
DIRECTIONS:  Going South on I-59 take the Weslyan Exit, turn left under the freeway and go south on Weslyan; when you get to Bellaire Blvd, turn right and the restaurant is about 1/2 to 1 block away on the left .
