I have forgotten, does the originator need to get credit approval if a master 
is in place?  Or does the credit dept. review the positions after the fact?

No I haven't spoken to Pat yet. I believe credit analysis has already been 
done before the ISDA was signed.
Like when we did the swap with Puerto, there was no credit done for that 
particular transaction.

Sara,
Here are the indicative terms we are looking to get three price quotes for 
from CMS.  Julian will need to get you the contact information for the 
counterparty.  We would like a letter from ENA requesting the quotes for the 
trade information specified below and an attached confirm format with the 
price, term and volumes left blank since those terms are not yet set.  Please 
let me know if you have any questions or if you need any additional 
information.  We would like to have this letter sent in the next few days and 
would like to request a response from CMS by the middle or end of next week.  
Julian can give you a more exact time frame for a response.   Please send 
Julian the draft for review and copy me.  Thanks for your help on this.  
Julian, have you spoke with Pat about the potential deal yet?
