Stewart:  I'll have to review their master to be certain (and insure that 
there is no specific prohibition against weather transactions).  In general, 
there is nothing else required specifically, although we may have to add some 
language to the weather confirmations themselves.  Sara

Sara -
Does Merced need to do anything to enter into financial weather transactions 
(remember that they have a ISDA and have done numerous power swaps for the 
past year)?


Thanks
