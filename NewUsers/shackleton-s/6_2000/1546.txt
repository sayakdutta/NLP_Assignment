Sara,

I have drafted the attached based on what we did for the GDR acquisition.  
Could you check the non-India trading names and titles to make sure they are 
current.  I checked with Samantha but she said she was having computer 
problems and wasn't familiar with the names.  And, obviously, we will not 
have this done by Monday morning.  Is there anything we can do to get the 
account opened on an expedited basis and then follow up with paperwork later?



Lena,

Once Sara checks the non-India names, may I have your permission to put your 
initials on these documents and get them signed?

Thanks,
Lauren
