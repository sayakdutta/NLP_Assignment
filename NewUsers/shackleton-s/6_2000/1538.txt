Hi Sara,

I met with accounting regarding these amounts. I will be forwarding a copy to 
you.

We have a total of .77 cents remaining in our account with Cargill.

Since we have several acounts in addition to Crude Oil, it is my 
recommendation that
we do not cancel the account as traders may want to utilize Cargill for other 
commodities.

Regards,
David



What were the dollar amounts on the printout that you sent to me?

Cargill said that we do not have a line of credit nor do we have money 
sitting in an account with them.
The account is inactive at this time.

Let's review our next step when you have an opportunity.
Thanks
David
