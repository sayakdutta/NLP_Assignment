Tanya:  I just spoke with Chris about this ARCO transaction which might trade 
TODAY.  We are "cleaning up" some of the language as it was based on the 
prior ARCO deal (when we were ECT).  Please note that Enron Corp. previously 
provided a guaranty.  I am not certain whether that guaranty is tied to the 
transaction specifically and I'll try to track down.  Will ENA provide a 
parent guaranty for the new transaction?  Please let me know.  Thanks.  Sara

Chris, I've attached a simplified confirm based on our prior May, 1999 
version.
The only change in the new draft is to represent the fact that we are now 
using
only firm energy rather than a blend of firm and nonfirm. As a result volume
weighting should only apply on holidays and Sundays when on-peak and off-peak
values may need to be weighted in with 24-hour firm values.

On a related issue, how quickly could you have a corporate guarantee 
available?

Dave
