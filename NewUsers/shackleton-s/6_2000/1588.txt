Attached are the two (2) sets of assignments with attached trade descriptions.

(1)  the first set (first two docs) is an assignment of trades between ENA 
and HS Resources, Inc.; after execution of the assignment, the trades will be 
between ENA and HS Energy Services, Inc.  subject to the ISDA which we are 
now negotiating [the second doc is an appendix consisting of 5 trades and I 
have asked the desk to confirm that these are the only outstanding trades]

(2)  the second set (last two docs) is an assignment of trades between J. 
Aron & Company and HS Energy Services, Inc; after execution of the 
assignment, the trades will be between J.Aron & Company and ENA subject to 
the 8/14/94 J.Aron/ENA ISDA [the fourth doc is an appendix of all existing 
trades between J.Aron/HS Energy Services, Inc.  I have no idea where this 
came from but I assume it is part of your agreement with HS.  Who is 
verifying the trades and are all trade terms acceptable?  Presently, the 
assignment is drafted such that a conflict between the Master and a confirm 
will be governed by the Master]
