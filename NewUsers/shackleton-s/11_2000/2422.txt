Diana: 

I negotiated the Enron North America Corp.  ISDA Master Agreement with the 
"President and Fellows of Harvard University" (together with John Suttle).  
Harvard is interested in metals trading.  What is the entity trading metals 
(financial)?  Will you evaluate the credit?

Please let me know.  Thanks.  Sara
