Treasa:  Bob Bruce told me that there was no "swap" activity on the prepay 
during my absence.  
Houston is closed down until Monday, Nov. 27 for the Thanksgiving holiday.
Normally, I would ask Joe Hunter on the confirm desk to take a look at the 
confirms.  I marked up the TD confirm to reflect my comments and provide an 
attached "schedule" of volumes since I thought it would be easier for you to 
match calc periods, volumes and rate payment dates.  Such a format has worked 
well in other prepaid structures.

If I don't go out of town tomorrow,  you can  reach me at home. My number is 
(713) 664-3207.
