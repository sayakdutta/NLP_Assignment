He is a lawyer for APEA.  Can I call him and let him know that the confirm 
was sent to APEA?  When was it sent?  Sara

I'm not sure who Philip Levy is, but yes, I did have my questions answered.

Bruce was able to help me set up the notification for Chase, and before I even
sent it, I had confirmed the changes verbally with Chase.    

Thanks,
Diane

 




Did you have your questions answered?  I have a voice mail from Philip Levy 
and need to respond.  Please give me a call after Thanksgiving.  Thanks.  Sara
