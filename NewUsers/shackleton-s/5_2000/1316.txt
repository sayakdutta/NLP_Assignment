Thanks for the redraft!  I am looking at the agreement now.  Also, I thought 
you would be interested in Mark's comment.  I would like to use arbitration 
in lieu of jurisdiction.  Please make that change and forward to me.  I will 
mark up with comments.  Thanks so much for your help.  Sara

The Enron policy for our English law Master is for arbitration - although I 
have to say, for purely financial contracts, I myself always prefer the 
Courts.

Kind regards

Mark:  Thanks so much for your explanation earlier today.  Just one more 
question, please:  is arbitration or litigation the preferance under English 
law?  How often do you negotiate to the contrary?  Thanks.  Sara
