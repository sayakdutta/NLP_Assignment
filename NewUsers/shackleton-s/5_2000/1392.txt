Shari:  I see that you added this to the legal/credit list.  Can you tell me 
why?  What type of deal do we do?  Did ECTI ever transact with DLJ Capital 
Funding, Inc. (for distressed loans)?  Are you familiar with the Loan 
Syndications and Trading Association, Inc. "standard terms and conditions"?  
Did you ever document a loan derivative?  Thanks.  Sara
