pushing your credit priorities will require some coordination.  Here's a

Please review the comments taken at each meeting and distributed to 
everyone.  Please use Lotus Notes to record/review activity.  We are 
depending on you to take needed action as required and we are doing the 
same.  Thanks.  Sara
