Jason:  I still cannot access your voice mail (isn't your extension 34454?)  
If I'm right, please have your assistant look into this.
Can we put these two brokerage agreements (below) at the top of your list?

I submitted two Executing Broker Agreements on April 24, 2000.  I'm trying to 
find out what the turnaround time might be.

1-Thomas Weisel Partners
2-Chase Hambrecht & Quist

I got a call from Hambrecht & Quist last week asking about their agreement.

Thanks,
