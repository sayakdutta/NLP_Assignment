We have a physical and financial jurisdictional survey conducted by ENA in 
1996.  I don't see an ISDA opinion but you can easily verify on the IDSA 
website.  Please let me know which surveys you need and we'll have them sent 
over.

Let me know if you have any other questions.

Hi, Sara!

Cynthia asked me to check with you guy about a Korean entity.  Michael 
Moulton has done a swap with a Korean entity that will be confirmed under a 
confirmation with Annex A attached.  Are there any special provisions we need 
to add for a Korean entity?

Thanks!

Marie
