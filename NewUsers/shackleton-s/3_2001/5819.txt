(1)  I cannot speak with Caroline Abramo at 2.  Please call her and explain 
that I'm in the midst of  transaction which must close today (it may roll 
into Monday).  Tuesday is a safe bet.  Mention that the deal is being pushed 
by the 50th floor over here.

(2)  Did you call Stuart?  Just let me know and I'll call him when I get off 
this call.
