Serge:

Sorry to take so long to respond.  A few things:

(1)  What is the correct legal name of the entity you are inquiring about?  
Is it the unregulated marketing arm of the regulated utility?

(2)  There has not been a commercial push from the ENA perspective to set up 
a new agreement with FPL which explains why I cannot get our credit  goup to 
react.  I'll broach the topic again when  I hear from you.

Please let me know if you have any other questions.
