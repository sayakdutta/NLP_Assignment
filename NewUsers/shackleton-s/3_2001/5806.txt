Please see if the attached format documents the par forward transactions in a 
manner more like CIBC (and a little different than the ENA format).  

Stuart:  I'll send the GTC's to you for review today.  I'm updating the ISDA 
format used in the global weather transactions (which are the only products 
using this format).  We may need to adjust the product description.
