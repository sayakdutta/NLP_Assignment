Tracy:

The Allegheny swap side letter provides that the parties will make a good 
faith effort to negotiate the ISDA master by April 6.  I am waiting with the 
firrst redraft of the agreement but can't get a response from anyone as to 
whom and where to send (via email).  I've left voice mails for Yair and Kate 
at Allegheny and Lauren at Sullivan and Cromwell.

Can you exert some pressure here?
