Thanks for the note and good wishes!

Probably wondering what I'm doing in the office on a Sundy as a 
newly-wed:catching up on email!

Justin's group deal with equity trading;  Jonathan Marsh will cover on the 
regulatory side.

Hope things are fine back at the ranch and going well for you.

Regards

Paul






Paul:

Just checking to see if you are the lawyer monitoring equity trading in the 
U.K.  I am charged with the oversight of Gary Hickerson's equity activity 
here in Houston and I want to coordinate with the London lawyer.  Please 
advise.

Also, I heard that you were recently married.  Congratulations!
