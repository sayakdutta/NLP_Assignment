Anita/Steve:

I'm working on the schedule.  Please confirm whether Washington (which 
airport) is closer to ;you.  Also, how difficult is it to get from the 
Baltimore ariport to you?  I'll let you know soon.  Mike will not be coming 
with me.

We have not received a response card from you as to whether you are coming.
Can you let us know soon (and whether Mike is coming with you)?

Love - Anita and Steve
