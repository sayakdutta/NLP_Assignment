You can confirm that it is not regulated and send a copy of cert. of incorp. which Deb Korkmas should have if Tana doesn't

Hi Sara
No one here seems to know anything about ERMT Corp.
Can you confirm it's not a regulated entity?  (Public Utility, etc.)
Can we get a copy of its Cert. of Incorporation (whatever you have in your
files is fine.)
Anything else you can tell me about the activity of the entity would also be
helpful.

Thanks.





Sibyl:

Did you want me to dupe the Enron Corp. documents, i.e., change
signature lines?
I have a copy of the Corporate Account Agreement (including the
Schedule) but not the Repo.

Thanks.  Sara
