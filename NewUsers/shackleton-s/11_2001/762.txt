Nora:

Per our conversation, please let me know what you can about existing board resolution or bylaws.  We are trying to change the signature card for the Enron Corp. Morgan Stanley account to eliminate Fastow and Glisan and replace with others.  The request originally went to Sheila Glover from Tim DeSpain.

Thanks.  Sara
