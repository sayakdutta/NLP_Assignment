To the best of my knowledge, please see the attached review of equity forward and swap deals which I have tracked for Enron Corp.  You should contact Clint Freeland (X57538) for further details.

This list does not include currency, rate or forward rate deals.

Other than rate or currency, what else do we use these Enron Corp masters for (I seem to recall used for Enron stock stuff)? Who would I contact and be able to get details on the transactions from? Someone in Corp? Thanks!!

 

Is there a way to find out what deals exist, if any, under Enron Corp ISDAs?
