Marie:  I don't know what this is about.  Can you recall WHICH Bear guaranty?  Did we ever get the "lost guaranty" letter?  I guess we could use Clem's short form of guaranty amendment and we'll have to verify with credit.  SS

Sara,

I just left you a voice mail about this.

We need to amend the Bear guaranty to cover the new ECT Europe Finance that we moved the Anker positions into.  By amending the guanranty I can free up $2.5mm cash.

Please tell me if this can happen.

Thanks,

Tom
