Hey, Carson!  Sorry to hear about you and Melissa but I know that life can 
always get better (if you let it).  
I've finally finished my two-year project of replacing most of my landscaping 
with "native plants."  Of course, I'm rarely home to enjoy them but 
everything looks great on the weekends.

I'm dying under a load of work here but I know better than to complain too 
much.

GO ROCKETS!
