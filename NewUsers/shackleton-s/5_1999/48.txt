Sheer volume! (has kept me from being up to date).  It's at the top of the 
list and I promise it by next week.

I do need to speak with you about this Duke issue which has apparently 
created some confusion over here.  Seems to me there are three issues here:  
(1) ECT's consent toDuke Energy Trading and Marketing LLC releasing the 
master to its affiliate, (2)  credit's assessment of trading with two Duke 
entities and (3) issues particular to trading power in Argentina (if any).  
Who is in charge of addressing Duke?  SS






Pablo would like to know the status of our comments to PC on the master.  Has 
there been any progress?
