As we discussed last week, ECT is sending a demand letter to Sonoco for the 
underpayment of $60,000.  I need the attachment which I have identified as 
merely Exhibit "A" to appear on a single sheet of paper (legal is fine).  We 
discussed your revision to cover the entire term of the swap AND revisions to 
the month of January, 1999 to reflect ECT's floating price as .33 (which will 
cause changes to the invoice amount and difference columns).  Also, instead 
of the term "Sonoco Price", I would prefer the caption "Floating Price 
recognized by Sonoco".  Please call if you have questions.  Thanks. Sara
