I am receiving calls from Gina Karathanos in Global Finance about this deal.  
She's inquiring about preparation of certificates, authorizations and 
signers.  Susan, please coordinate with Mary on that end (I presume we follow 
the same format as Carol).  As far as I know, closing is scheduled for Aug. 
24.  Apparently, lots of ENE officers will be out of town next week.  Do we 
know who will sign for ENA?  Thanks.  SS
