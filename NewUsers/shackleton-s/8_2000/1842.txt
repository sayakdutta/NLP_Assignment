Kaye:  Please schedule Sam for an hour on Friday.  Also, when avoidable, I'd 
prefer not to meet at 1 pm because people are always late.  Thanks.  sara

Sam:  Please get on my calendar for Friday.  We need to update agreements, 
status, etc.  Also, we need to add a "Futures Agreement" designation to Lotus 
Notes.  Please bring your latest printouts for existing agreements and 
provide a copy for me.  Let's take about an hour.  Thanks.  Sara

ps  Also, if you have any questions about masters, etc., bring them along!
