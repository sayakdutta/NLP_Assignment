One question.  Who is Paul?





Rod:  FYI, Paul's doing bond swap with UBS.  Does credit have any issues?  I 
am verifying the Enron party (since I am not familiar with the ECT Investment 
Trust).  Please advise.  Sara

     Paul,
     Please find attached a blank template Bond Total Return Swap Master
     Confirm and the adjoining Supplemental Confirm.  It has been updated
     to take three hours for you to accept or reject the Market Value set
     by the Calculation Agent.
     Please call with any questions or concerns.  Hope to get a trade on
     ASAP.

     Thanks and Regards,




     Greg MacKay
