A copy of the 8/31/99 letter from Erik Ludtke was received at 18:10 on fax 
no. "713 646 4818" addressed to the attention of "Assistant General 
Counsel".  This would conform to notices in the master agreement (for 
Sections 5 and 6), an executed copy of which we have never received or seen.  

On a different matter, do you think that we can discuss the omnibus templates 
tomorrow?  I am pressed for a response.  SS
