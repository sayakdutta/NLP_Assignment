Christopher,
I think you might be the best person to look at this.  It is a financial 
power swap with a cooperative.  Let's discuss.

Thanks,
Tanya

Attached is a general confirm outlining the proposed transaction with 
Deseret.  I am not sure where the original of this documet came from.   
However, I am providing it to you so that you can have the language for the 
general terms of the transaction.  

Let me know if I may provide any other information.  

In talking with Deseret, they felt that they had a much better chance of 
pushing a short form ISDA agreement for this trasaction through the general 
counsel than they would the long form ISDA.  That said, I think our best 
approach is to set up a short form ISDA agreement for Deseret.   As usual, 
the sooner the better on putting together the short form ISDA document.  
Today if possible.  Please let me know.
