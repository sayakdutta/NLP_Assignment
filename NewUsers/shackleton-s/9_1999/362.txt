Greetings!  I hope that we can make certain plans to meet when I am in Sao 
Paulo and to have a telephone conversation this week.

I will arrive in Sao Paulo on Sunday, Sept. 19.  Andrea Bertone and I will be 
meeting with Jose Emilio on Monday, Sept. 20. regarding physical trading 
matters.  Would you be able to meet with me at Enron's office on either 
Tuesday or Wednesday, Sept. 21 (preferably) or Sept. 22 to discuss certain 
aspects of financial trading?  I will be able to clarify the specific issues 
this week.  I would also like to schedule a telephone call this week, say 
Wednesday or Thursday to discuss.  Please e-mail me as to whether we can meet 
in Sao Paulo.  I will try to call you today.  Let me know if you have a 
convenient time.  

Sara
