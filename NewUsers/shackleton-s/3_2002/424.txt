I am available until 3 pm

 Remaining gas demand letters will be sent today.  I have already received a number of queries on the demands sent on Friday.  

 

Sara,

I sent you an invitiation to a meeting earlier today and noticed that I scheduled it for last Saturday; my apologies.  Anyway, Louis and I are trying to get together with you and Alan Aronowitz to get up to speed on the status of Live CP's that were sent Demand Letters and to begin determining a process for moving ahead with terminated CP's.

We are able to meet in your building at whatever time works best for yours and Alan's schedules.

Mike Bridges
