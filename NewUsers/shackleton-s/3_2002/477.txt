Would like to verify this one before I meet with Mark at 11 am.

In a letter dtd 3/13/02 Ormet said they wired to ENA $14,645.03 (plus interest) to cure a contract default.  I've been watching the cash inflow spreadsheet that gets published daily but haven't seen these funds on that report.  

Can you let me know whether you see any such payment from Ormet?

Thanks
