Wendy,

Please run the due diligence on Oregon Steel Mills.  We're looking at 
presenting them both a financial and physical gas contract.  Once you've had 
a chance to propose some credit terms, let's discuss.

Thanks,
Tracy

We met with OSM and have another meeting scheduled for tomorrow to discuss 
proposed structures hopefully to be followed by specific pricing.  We're 
talking average monthly volumes of 7,300-7,500 MMBTU for approximately 6-8 
months at a price around $10/MMBTU.  I'm sending you this as a "reminder", as 
if and when we're able to agree upon pricing and a proposed structure we'll 
need to "paper" it by weeks end.  At this time we could be going either 
physically or financially.  Thanks,  John
