Yes, Monty, Keith and I had a great lunch at Galatoire's last Friday.  Monty 
had to leave early for a soccer game in Memphis (I think).  Maybe we can get 
Donna to raid the X-mas wine in the cellar.  Sara

Hi Sara:

I missed you and Julia at the Enron Xmas party at Enron field. It was a
lot of fun a the fireworks were fantastic. Did you, Monty and Keith hook
up in New Orleans on D-day December 7th, like you had planned? I hope
so.

I hope you and the hounds have a great holiday season. Also, I am
looking forward to the new millennium edition of the family photo. If I
am still on THE LIST of recipients.

Take Care,

Carson
