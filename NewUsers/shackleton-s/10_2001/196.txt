Mark:

The ISDA Best Practices Statement did not address OPIS [or ARGUS] as our proposal did.
But for those indexes being at issue, I have a record of the following parties having requested use of the ISDA methodology:

	The Chase Manhattan Bank
	Glencore Ltd.
	Hess Energy Trading Company
	Societe Generale
	Koch Petroleum Group LP
