Tracy:

Let me know what you think.  I'll check with a lawyer from the physical power group.  Also, we should at a minimum, preserve setoff with respect to ENA's affiliates.  Sara

Sara -

I have spoken with our in-house regulatory specialist and she has informed
me that we cannot agree to include our regulated or non-regulated Affiliates
in Set Off under the Public Utility Holding Company Act without getting
approval from the SEC.

Please advise if we can proceed on the ISDA with carving out Affiliates in
Set Off, as per our original request.

Regards,
Michelle

Michelle:

With respect to your setoff request, we cannot agree to eliminate setoff
for your non-regulated affiliates.  Perhaps you could provide us with the
regulated affiliate(s) for a carve out.  I look forward to hearing from
you.  Regards.

   Sara -

   As per Marie's instructions, please find attached a blackline
   incorporating
   the changes that will be required to be made in the final form of ISDA
   (modifications to the Notice and Set-Off provisions).  The attached is
   the
   last version that I have but if the changes are acceptable, I would
   suggest
   that you take the changes and incorporate it into your form of agreement
   since it is the final version.

    <<ENRON ISDA.REVISED 9.26.01.doc>>

   Once reviewed, please let me know if the changes are acceptable - at
   which
   point you can forward to me a revised Schedule (without the signature
   page)
   via e-mail and I can have the agreement countersigned and replace the
   Schedule with your revised Schedule.

   Thank you for your patience.

   Regards,
   Michelle
