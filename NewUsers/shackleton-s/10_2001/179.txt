Russ:

The forwards and puts should be signed and faxed back to Lehman.  Please note the template for these trades (with respect to the definition of "material") left out the word "into".  I didn't find it necessary to impede Enron Corp.'s signature; just let Phil know for the next deal.  Thanks.  Sara

Here it is, Sara.

Tim - we are comfortable with the changes to the definition of "material"
given that Lehman is not entering the market as a result of "rolling" the
transaction.  Should we amend the transaction in or enter in any future
transaction where we enter the market on behalf of ENE, we would require the
"standard" definition of "material.
