Tammy:

Thanks for the quick response.  Your "business day" suggestion is fine.  With respect to your second comment, ENA agrees to AAA arbitration in all phases of its physical and financial business.  We are not a clearing member of any exchange so we do not seek arbitration before a regulatory board.  Hope this helps.  Sara

 

Sara,

For the purposes of margin, defining a business day as those days on which banks are open in NY and Houston will work.  For the purposes of error notification, we should remove "business day" and insert something along the lines of "market day" and define "market day" as any day that the market on which the contract traded is open.  There are a few days the markets are open but the banks are closed.   Will that work for you?

Both Morgan Stanley and Enron are registered with the NFA.  Is there a specific reason you can't agree to NFA arbitration?

Regards,

Tammy
