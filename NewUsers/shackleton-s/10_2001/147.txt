Tanya:  I think we sent the ENA ISDA to you but I'm going to refax since First Union is calling daily.  We sent them a "blank" Paragraph 13 and they are asking for credit terms.  Thanks for your help.  Sara

 

can you fax me the schedule and csa for the ena isda (853-9476) and I will decide if similar terms are appropriate

 

Tanya:  Enron Corp. wants to transact with FTU.  I sent FTU a "blank" Paragraph 13 subject to ENA's credit review.  Can you give me a call about this one?  The FTU lawyer is calling me and already has comments to our draft Paragraph 13.  Thanks.  Sara

Tanya:  FTU has asked to resume negotiations on the ISDA.  We originally sent our draft without a Paragraph 13 and FTU wants a Paragraph 13 (similar to the one FTU negotiated with ENA).  If you are agreeable to credit, can you please propose a credit worksheet?

Thanks.  Sara
