Yes, I've been contacted by Paul Puchot in Global Finance.  There is some type of meeting this afternoon.  It is not clear to anyone which Enron company is involved.  FYI - I was in  the midst of negotiating an ISDA with BSIL for Enron Corp. with respect to potential forward deals.

Are you working on Bruin?  Davis Thames told me Kristina Mordaunt is leading, but if involves ENA ISDA makes sense for you to be working with them on that portion.

Thanks,
Tanya

I received a phone call from Nancy Bauer with Bear Stearns International Ltd. ("Bear Stearns").  Nancy has  informed me that Bear Stearns will be doing a large trade with Enron North America Corp. ("ENA") very soon.  Their goal is to get an ISDA Master Agreement in place quickly.  Bear Stearns would like for the ISDA Master Agreement with ENA to mirror the ISDA Master Agreement dated July 3, 2000 between Enron Credit Limited and Bear Stearns.   

My review of our Lotus Notes database did not reveal that Enron Credit Limited has a Master Agreement with Bear Stearns.  If this Master Agreement has been executed, please make an entry for it in Lotus Notes.  Also, please e-mail me a copy of the execution version of the Enron Credit Limited and Bear Stearns Master Agreement for legal and credit in Houston to review.  Since time is of the essence, your attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.
