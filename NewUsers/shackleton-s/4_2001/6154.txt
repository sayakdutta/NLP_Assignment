Mary/Cheryl:

Carol has seven (7) master swap agreements to be reassigned.  Cheryl and I 
will work on these together.  All appear on the legal/credit list.

(1)  Cross Timbers Oil Company
(2)  Camden Property Trust
(3)  Clorox Company (The)
(4)  Montana Power Comopany (The)
(5)  Ocean Energy, Inc.
(6)  Quebecor World USA, Inc.

Mary:  Would you please reassign paralegals to Cross Timbers and Quebecor?  
These were handled by Samantha.  Maybe Marie could assist; these don't appear 
to be urgent.

Thanks.
