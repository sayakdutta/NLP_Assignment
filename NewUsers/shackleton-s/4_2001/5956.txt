Cheryl:

I think it would be helpful for the desk and legal to retain monthly meetings 
just to stay abreast of activity and expectations.  Why don't we keep the end 
of month meetings?  I'll resend the schedule to you.

Sounds like Keegan has somethig wrong.  I have no meetings scheduled with you 
tomorrow.  I don't know anything about a 9 am meeting.  The brokerage 
meetings were originally scheduled every other week until we could bring 
ourselves up to date (and we met last week).  The swap group meeting is 
always held twice monthly.  Hope this helps.

Hi Sara, 

I need to reschedule on of the three brokerage account meetings that are on 
my calendar for tomorrow.  

My calendar indicates that I have a 9 a.m. one hour meeting with you, a 10 
a.m. one hour swaps meeting, a 1:30 brokerage account meeting a 2:30 one hour 
credit support meeting and a 4 p.m. meeting with someone from yet another 
Enron entity seeking to open a brokerage account on an urgent basis.

Keegan and I have now developed a strategy to ensure that we do not have so 
many meetings on one day.  Most of the other meetings are group meetings and 
therefore are not possible to reschedule.
