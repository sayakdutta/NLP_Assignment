Just a follow-up to our conversation of last week to see how you were coming 
along.  When would you like to schedule some time to discuss the ISDA?  
Please let me know if you have any questions and/or whether I can assist you 
in any way.  I understand that our respective traders are discussing a 
transaction.  You may contact me at 713/853-5620 or e-mail.  Thanks.  Sara
