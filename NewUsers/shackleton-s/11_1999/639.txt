Muni's and other public entities (state, local and federal) are the type of 
counterparties for which we require legal opinions and the whole ball of wax, 
so to speak, including background documentation, resolutions, etc.  If we 
cannot prove authority to transact, then the agreement may not be enforceable 
(i.e., if the counterparty owes us money, we may not be able to collect).  We 
definitely need to review certified copies of  the counterparty's charter, 
enabling statutes or legislation creating or authorizing the counterparty, 
its bylaws, charter or constituent docs, investment policies, guidelines or 
restrictions, resolution approving the swap (or other) transactions and 
authorizing a person(s) to transact,etc AND a legal opinion (the format of 
which we always provide to the counterparty).    It's best to execute the 
ISDA but we do have an omnibus drafted for municipalities.  Call if you need 
further help.  Sara
