Lawyer Dago:

Got your card on Friday and it made my weekend!  I'm glad I could help out.  We definitely need to get together soon.  I've had an awful summer.  My mom died in July.  My car flooded in June.  Mike's mom died in June.  Can't think of a reason to be gloomy so I can't wait to see you for lunch.  I'll stay in touch!  Sara
