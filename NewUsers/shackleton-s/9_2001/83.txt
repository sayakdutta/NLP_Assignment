You MUST carve this transaction out of the CSFBI master. The margin does NO=
T flow around the structure.  If you read the confirms, you will see that E=
nron receives fixed 150MM from CSFBI day 1 and pays it back WTI basically a=
t the end of the deal (that is where all the volumes are concentrated).  Th=
us, this deal is out of the money to Enron 150MM and they can call us for t=
hat margin which we would have to post for the entire term of the deal.  Ou=
r swap with MSCG has us paying fixed, but we do not pay it until the end of=
 the deal (that is where all the volumes are concentrated). Thus, this swap=
 could allow for either party to margin based on WTI price movement - but i=
n essence, it is an at the money trade today. You will NOT be able to margi=
n MSCG.  Thus, the net effect is you have to post margin, but you do not re=
ceive any.  If you do not carve this deal out of the margin arrangements, y=
ou wil defeat the purpose of executing a prepay - you will have to post the=
 money they prepay you as collateral.  Hope it is clear - I am out of the o=
ffice tomorrow, but I will be back on Monday.
