Pat:

I am accepting an inhouse opinion from the City of Glendale.  However, I would like for Enron North America Corp. ("ENA", the swap counterparty to Glendale) to engage independent counsel for its own benefit.  The opinion would be given to ENA.  If you're the guy, please call me.  Thanks.

Read the message.  I think we can help.  My question is, who is this
opinion going to be given on behalf of.  If it is from the City of
Glendale to Enron, the logical firm to give it is Glendale's "bond
counsel" since that is the outside law firm which 1) knows municipal
finance, 2) has an existing relationship with the City and 3) isn't
going to get into conflicts issues (which we probably would if we were
going to deliver an opinion on behalf of Glendale to Enron).

We think the Jones, Hall firm in San Francisco may be bond counsel to
Glendale, but perhaps not.  Let me know how we can help.

I would first talk to Pat Boylston at Stoel Rives 503-294-9116.  Stoel
Rives has recently opened a San Francisco office and Pat, who will know
about 90% of the stuff to give the opinion, can probably find a
California attorney from their office to finish it off. ----cgy
