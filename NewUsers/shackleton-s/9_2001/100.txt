Won't you carve your deal out of the Threshold for your "Deemed ISDA"?

 

So long as they adopt 10a as well--that is what we are doing.  We will need to be careful as and when this is finalized to segregate threshold etc. for the prepay deal.  
Also, talk to Musch re tax rep.
 

Mary:  FYI , just spoke with Anita Khosla.  The ENA ISDA with CSFB will be with the head banking office in Zurich and we will identify the branches with which we anticipate business, including at the moment, NY, London, Cayman Islands.  I have received comments to our Schedule and CSA.
