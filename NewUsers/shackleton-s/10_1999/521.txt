Let's do it on Tuesday, Oct. 26 at 2 pm.  If Brent is available, all the 
better.  Let me know if you want to visit Enronland.  I don't mind the walk.

Monday or Tuesday of next week is ok for me with the exception of 8:30 to 
10:30 on Tuesday.  Wednesday is out of the question since there is a Comgas 
II all day working session planned.

Let me know what date works best for you.

OK, let me try to catch up here.  Brent may not get my e-mail for awhile.  I 
believe that he is in Houston today on personal business and will stay until 
the conclusion of the ENA legal conference which is Th & Fr next week.  What 
is your availability on Mon or Tues next week?  I will try to put something 
together (at least you and I can have a game plan so that we can plan our 
next visit to SP).  This voice stuff is a bummer.  Sara
