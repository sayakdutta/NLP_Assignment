Patricia:  I was just checking to see if you have had an opportunity to 
review our ISDA Schedule for the referenced entities.  Please let me know if 
you have any questions.  I believe that Susan Flynn in our office faxed you a 
copy of our form of Schedule last week. I look forward to hearing from you.  
Regards.  Sara
