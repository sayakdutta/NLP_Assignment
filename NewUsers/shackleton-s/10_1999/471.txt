How would you like to handle?  We could do a Deemed ISDA if you feel 
comfortable that the counterparty will sign the ISDA.  How long is the deal?

Brent, could we close a Swap with TGS without having the ISDA signed but 
then, a few weeks later after we sending the confirmation we sign the ISDA?

TGS wants to close a swap with us starting November 1st. The problem is that 
their lawyer, Enrique Prini (do you know him??) is going for vacation next 
monday for two weeks. I told the guy from TGS that he should have Chris 
Dougall taking over while he is outside, but he did not sound convinced. 
Maybe you could talk to Chris?? But still, let's wait until they send us 
their comments.
