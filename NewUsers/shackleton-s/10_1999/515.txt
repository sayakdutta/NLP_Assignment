OK, let me try to catch up here.  Brent may not get my e-mail for awhile.  I 
believe that he is in Houston today on personal business and will stay until 
the conclusion of the ENA legal conference which is Th & Fr next week.  What 
is your availability on Mon or Tues next week?  I will try to put something 
together (at least you and I can have a game plan so that we can plan our 
next visit to SP).  This voice stuff is a bummer.  Sara
