Speak of the deviI!  I just had someone leave a voice mail for counsel (who 
is at an outside meeting).  I will definitely have a lawyer call tomorrow 
morning.  Is Utah in your time zone?  Sara 



What do you think the timing will be on hearing back from your utah counsel?

I have retained Utah counsel.  I'll keep you posted.  I haven't looked at 
your other question yet but I will !  Sara
