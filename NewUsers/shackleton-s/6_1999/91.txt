I'm always in town.  Just let me know when you're going to be downtown.  
Nothing new here either!  Just work, work, work.  I hope to get away for the 
fourth but one never knows.  SS

Sara:

I have not heard from you in a while. No news here. Just finishing up
some work. I imagine that you are still busy. Any interesting vacations
in the works? Maybe we can have lunch next week if you are in town. Let
me know if you are available. I need to get downtown more often, and it
would be nice to see you again.
