Hi Everyone!!

Just a reminder to please make sure that you have your calendars marked for 
our upcoming Legal Conference.  It will be held again this year at The 
Woodlands Resort & Conference Center on October 5-6, 2000.  Details and an 
agenda for this event will be sent out to everyone soon.

We welcome any ideas and/or suggestions that you may have to make the 
conference convenient, worthwhile and/or enjoyable.  These should be directed 
to Travis or myself via e-mail.

We look forward to seeing you there.

Thanks!!!!
