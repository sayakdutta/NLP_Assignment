Joel:  Are you also going to send out the ABN Amro guaranty?  We're sending 
the draft credit agreement.  Sara

Ken Fatur had to go out of the office today so he asked that we copy Jim 
Naughton on all the docs.  Jim will distribute them throughout Bank One.  
Attached is the latest deal team list with Jim's email.  

Please send out the docs (boilerplate Credit Agmt. and Trading Guarantee 
customised to each bank) in separate emails so that the banks do not know who 
their competition is.  To ABN please send to Kriss Grosshans and his 
Attorney, Kyle Nenninger.  To Bank One, please send to Ken and Jim.  Also 
please include the Give Up agreement with Bank One.    

Thanks for your help.  .  I am looking forward to getting these closed!

Have a great weekend,
Sarah
