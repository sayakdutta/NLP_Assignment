Mary:  Just a reminder.  Tana is not in charge of form changes; Susan Bailey 
handles that function.  Tana's primary role is "special projects" but she is 
helping Susan and Samantha with daily matters until Stephanie begins work and 
has some experience.  Sara

I suggest the attached language be substituted for the current language in 
the schedules in respect of Engineering Report where  a PV/PDP mac is 
utilized.  Tana, maybe this could go as an optional insert under Docs to be 
Delivered, rather than back in the collateral schedule with the pv/pdp 
language, so people won't forget to put it in under required deliveries.  
Thanks.  Mary
