Enron Corp. has NOT agreed to:
1.  Credit Event Upon Merger
2.  Added Payer reps (or other tax related changes)
3.  Waiver of Jury Trial

I think Barclays may back down from the Cross Default changes.
Sheryl wants to stet her changes to "Automatic Early Termination."
Sheryl does need to see the other Ghost template changes.
