Lynn Aven and I are in the process of finalizing a memo on the Argentina trip 
and we will also have a separate list of "action points" for Mike G.  I am 
not planning to do anything further with respect to Argentina per your 
instructions (eg, there is an ADA conference in June and we have been asked 
to provide a speaker; we have been asked to comment on the ADA local master 
format; finalizine trader guidelines and termsheet format).  Also, I am not 
planning to do anything further with respect to Brazil other than finalize 
our financial trading matrix.  I have cancelled my trip to Sao Paulo at the 
end of March and will table the "derivatives training" indefinitelly.

There is a half day Argentine Derivatives Association conference scheduled 
for the afternoon of March 22 here in downtown Buenos Aires.  The topic will 
be primarily regarding credit derivatives.  I am planning on having Andrea 
attend and, if possible, I am planning on attending as well.  I think it is 
important that we begin to get involved in ADA activities even if we cannot 
currently transact in the nascent local derivatives market.  The cost will be 
$250 per person.  

Mark, I believe Sara has a copy of the ADA brochure if you are interested in 
getting more information regarding the association.

Regards,
Brent
