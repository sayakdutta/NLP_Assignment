FYI - Southwestern Bell is installing equipment in my home on April 3.  They 
will call me 1 hour before arrival.  This is just a head's up that I may have 
to dash out sometime during the day.  SS

Monday would be the best day for Sara.  I've put Matthias on her calendar for 
2 pm (Houston time).

Hi Delores

Matthias Lee, the legal counsel from Singapore will be in Houston during the 
week 3 - 7 April 2000.  Besides attending the Enron Law Conference on 5 - 7 
April, Matthias will be in the Houston office from 3 to 4 April (Monday & 
Tuesday) and he would like to drop by Sara Shackleton's office to say 
hello.   Could you please check Sara's schedule to see if Sara is free to see 
Matthias on the 3rd or the 4th?  

Thanks for your help.

Angeline
Assistant to Matthias Lee
