     On an early conference call, Ian Schottlaender made the comment that in 
previous deals some of the banks have been confused by the termination 
provisions which were the first provisions in the Swap Schedule and, 
consequently, appeared on the front cover.  He asked if these provisions 
could be moved to a different part of the document and so were not 
conspicuous on the front cover.
     Accordingly, I swapped Part 1 of the Schedule with Part 5 of the 
Schedule.  Unfortunately, this meant that the CompareRite documents sent out 
earlier this week contained a lot of blacklined language, making it difficult 
to read Part 1 and Part 5.
     Attached to this e-mail is a blackline of the current Part 5 to the 
Hawaii Schedule compared to Part 1 of the Ghost Schedule, and the current 
Part 1 of the Hawaii Schedule compared to Part 5 of the Ghost Schedule.
     Please call me at 214-659-4414 if you have any questions or comments.
