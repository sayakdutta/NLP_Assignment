Here is the general idea:

It is the understanding of The Dial Corporation and Enron North America that 
ENA is working to provide commodity risk management services to Re-Box Inc. 
to finance the construction of a linerboard facility  Should this endeavor be 
completed prior to May 1st and ENA  not exercise on the swaption above, Enron 
will pay The Dial Corporation the sum of $200,000.

Will this or something like this suffice?

Thanks.

Ed Quinn
