Fine with me.  I will have to leave at 6 pm Houston.  Brent Hendry (X37124) 
will be available tomorrow if any issues arise.  Of course, Tana will be here 
as well.  SS

With so much paper distributed last night, is it prudent to have a call 
whenever possible this morning with the three banks and all of the internal 
people on the line to sign off on the documentation and develop a plan for 
obtaining execution of all the paper?  I would think we need to have 
everything signed today in order to initiate the wire transfers tomorrow, 
which means we are basically out of time on negotiating the paper.

Let me know what you think.

Greg
