Tanya:  Rodney and Finley are reviewing the two existing Citibank masters 
(ECT/Nighthawk).  Two swaps will be documented under the ECT/Citibank maste 
and two under the new Garden State master  (Was Molly in the process of 
amending that master?  She never returned my voice mail.).   Rodney and/or 
Finley should call you.  Sara

You have been leading this up to this point.  Do you wish to continue, or did 
you need an assist?

All:  I met with Rodney Malcolm and Finley Biggerstaff about the two 7-year 
paper swaps between each of Garden State/CITI and ENA/CITI.  Who will be 
handling credit for the new master and the transactions in general?  I am 
told that this is a Q3 deal.  Thanks.  Sara

Molly:  I left you a vm about prior efforts to amend the ENA/CITI master.  
Weren't ;you speaking wth someone at Citibank?
