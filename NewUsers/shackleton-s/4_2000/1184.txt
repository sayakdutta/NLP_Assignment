Sheila:  Please per my voice mail, let's sit down in my office and catch up 
because there are a lot of loose ends on the brokerage side (particularly 
with Marie leaving).  I can address you emails (current and past) at that 
time.  Thanks.  Sara

Have you been able to locate a copy?
Thanks. Sheila

Sara,
May I have a copy of the Morgan Stanley Prime Broker Agreement and the 
Overseas Lending Agreement.
Jeff and I have been talking to Goldman Sachs about a similar arrangement and 
wanted to re-review the Morgan Stanley structure.
Thank. Sheila
