Sorry I can't help.
Also, you know that legal will be out of the office from Wed. afternoon 
through the end of the week.  Are there any pressing items?  Sara

I faxed the final confirmation to Patti Melcher at Echo yesterday.  In order 
to get the counterparty set up in Global, I need something on EMP Echo 
letterhead.  Does anyone have anything that they could fax to me, that 
indicates the full company name, address, and maybe even bank instructions?  
( I know--I'm asking for a lot!)  Thanks very much for your help.
