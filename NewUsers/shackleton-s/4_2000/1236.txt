Susan:  You were going to verify whether the ABN AMRO futures agreement 
should be executed by Enron Australia Finance Pty. Ltd. (or ENA with Shane 
acting pursuant to the Services Agreement).  Please let me know so that 
either David or I can move forward on the futures agreement.  Thanks.  Sara

I've checked my notes and spoken to Heidi and it appears the delay was 
settling the mark up (107.5%) in the Agreement. Heidi believes that this 
figure can be reduced to 100% (which is current practice). If everyone is 
agreeable I will arrange execution.

Attached please find my mark-up of the Australian Services Agreement. I have 
attached a blacklined version for ease of reference. 

Apart from changing the name from ECT to ENA, I have modified clause 1 in 
Schedule 1 to more accurately reflect the intended products.



Please call me if any questions. 

Many thanks, 

Shari
