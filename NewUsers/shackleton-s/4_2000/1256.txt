Brant, Tom

Enserco Energy busted on line today.  Although we are collateralized with 
L/C's, our exposure is increasing due to the size of the on line volume they 
have been doing.  ENA sent an ISDA draft to them a few weeks ago, with no 
response.  Today I spoke to their Credit Manager, Don Perkins, and informed 
him that we can not take on additional volume unless we have an executed 
ISDA. He is going to review, with his legal, the contract and will get back 
to me.  At this point I feel we should not take on any further transactions 
until the ISDA is signed.  Please let me know your thoughts.

Please forward this e-mail on to the appropriate EOL people so they are aware 
of Enserco's status.
