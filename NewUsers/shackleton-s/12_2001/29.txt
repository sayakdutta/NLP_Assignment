There is a Weil Gotshal lawyer in your office named Andrew Harting. (currently in a first floor conference room - 30101).  He and I just spoke about the Bear situation.  He will also assist with the Enron Credit Limited efforts to move ENA and ECI positions to London.  Please contact him and bring him up to date.  Then let's talk.  We just tried to conference you in.
