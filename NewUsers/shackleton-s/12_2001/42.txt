Caroline:

I haven't spoken with Frank in several days.  You may want to ask Holly (his former assistant) for a number to just say hello.  He seems to be doing a little better each day.  Can we set up a call later today and I'll try to fill you in as much as I can?  There is a developing process and I'll tell you how it is supposed to work.  I have a meeting in at 2:30 Houston time so I'll call you in a few minutes or afterwards.

Sara- I am sorry to hear Frank has left.. have you spoken to him, is he OK? How are you doing?

Can you please tell me how you are dealing with counterparties who still have exposure to Enron?

I know all contracts are null and void.. what is the process for them to take off deals.

The only counterparties I have with any exposure are:
tudor
wexford

I am asking for them specifically.

Also, on monies we owe counterparties.. like tudor and catequil, what is the process they must go through?

Thanks very much,
Caroline
