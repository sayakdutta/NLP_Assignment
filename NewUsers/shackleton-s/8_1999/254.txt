The draft documents for the index/swap structure:



I will be out of the office until the 16th.  Jan will be able to get hold of 
me if I am out of cell range.

In my absence Christian has graciously volunteered to shepard the deal as 
needed.

Sara:  Have I done severe damage to the confirm/schedule?
