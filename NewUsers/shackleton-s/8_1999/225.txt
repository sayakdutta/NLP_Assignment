We have not received anything yet.  Carol Gravener is my new Duke contact for 
this ISDA and I left a message today with her to see exactly when she sent it 
out.  She is out of her office until Wednesday so, I may not receive a 
response before then.

When I spoke to her on July 28th, she said that they were sending the 
comments to us so, I assume that we should be seeing them this week,

Regards,

Pat

Duke did not send comments back to us like Julie Dill had advised a couple of 
weeks ago.  However, they will be sending these to us tomorrow.
