Janine:

Congratulations on your promotion!

I need an update on the back-office relationship between Enron Credit Inc. 
(ECI) and Enron Credit Ltd. (ECL) Does London confirm the ECI trades?  If so, 
I assume there is a power of attorney from ECI to someone in London.  Or will 
ECI trades be confirmed in the U.S.?

I received a call from someone in London inquiring as to whether Greg Whalley 
could sign for ENA because he was in London.  I believe this was in relation 
to the credit business.  Are U.K. traders booking credit deals in the name of 
ENA or is this some type of back-office function performed on behalf of ENA?  
Any reason not to use ECI or ECL  here?

 Also, can you send a copy of the services agreement (if any) between any 
companies performing services on behalf of either ECI or ECL?

Thanks.
