All:  Do you need any of the ISDA "boilerplate" language ( the ISDA Master 
Agreement and the ISDA Credit Support Annex) to attach to the draft 
Schedules/Paragraph 13 which we prepare to send to our counterparties?  We do 
not have the "boilerplate" in a word document.

Also, is there anything that Houston legal can do to facilitate your 
transactions?
