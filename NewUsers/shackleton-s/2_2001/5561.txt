Richard:

This is a first for me.  I received the following objection to our standard 
arbitration language:

"The arbitration does not provide for expedited procedures with limited 
discovery and limited live testimony.   This could take as long as in court 
and cost more."

Is this a valid objection?  If so, how should we amend our language?  Or 
should we be silent as to jurisdicition without waiving any objections 
(venue, forum) and waive jury trial?

I look forward to hearing from you.  Thanks.
