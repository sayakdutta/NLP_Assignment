Caroline:

I am reviewing Moore comments.
Brent Hendry is handling Catequil.
I don't know what Paloma is.

Sara- can you please let me know the status of the Paloma and Moore documents?

On Paloma, I was under the impression all the points were agreed- are we just 
waiting for them to send back the signed doc?

Moore- any sticking points that I can talk to their business line about.?

Catequil- have they sent back another draft yet?

Thanks very much,
Caroline...
