Scott/Sara/Dale,

Does anyone disagree with the below (Trade Date should be July 23).  The 
confirm will go out immediately when you respond.

thanks,
Joe

Since Scott Neal's phone call with the counterparty was July 23 I believe 
that should be the correct date.  The call made by Julian and Federico on 
July 20 was not effective to bind ECT.  Please confirm this with Sara and 
Scott and make sure everyone is on board with this.  I am sure Scott was just 
using the draft deal ticket Julian prepared and Julian used the date they 
called rather than the date that Scott did the deal.



Brent,

One last question on the Central Puerto S.A. doc.  We currently have the 
Trade Date as July 23, but the tickets we received say July 20th.  Is July 
20th correct?  

Thanks,
Joe
