Hello there!  I know that you are out of the country.  Thanks for forwarding 
the message from Andre Cangucu.  I have been through your materials but do 
not find any involvement you may have had with specific swaps; the items I 
found were generic and were in the form of law firm memoranda (e.g., 
"Derivatives and FX Transactions in Brazil", "Trading with Brazilian 
Counterparties", etc.).  Am I missing something?  Look forward to seeing you 
soon.  Sara
