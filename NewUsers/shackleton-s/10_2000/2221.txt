Jorge:  You are trying to be too efficient!  Just kidding, because I just had 
a conversation wtih the U.K  tax person and the following issues remain 
unresolved but are in the process of being addressed:

1.  credit.com payment, back-office and negotiation
2.  Enron Japan trading (online/offline)
3.  London online FX hedging
4.  London equity hedging

Sorry I can't give you any answers right now.  All of these issues are 
tax-driven and are being addressed.  Sara

Good Afternoon Sara,

I was just reviewing some old notes and wanted to ask if the Enron Japan 
issue was ever resolved. The issue was Darren Dalage doing Japanese Yen FX 
trades in the name of ENA. I am holding some old confirmations pending the 
resolution of this issue.

Regards,

Jorge
