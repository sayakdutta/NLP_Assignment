Sara:

I received a call from Mega today.  That financial gas/power deal could come 
together today.  Attached is the draft confirm you prepared.  Let me know 
ASAP if you have any "issues" with closing this deal pursuant to the language 
you prepared.  I will contact you immediately if it closes.

Thanks!

Chris
