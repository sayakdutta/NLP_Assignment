Gail:

My London trader, Derek Lee, tells me that no one has received the GSI Master 
Repurchase Agreement.  The Enron Credit Limited lawyer in London is Denis 
O'Connell.  Can you please check with your London counterpart about having 
the document forwarded to Derek and Denis is our London office?  Thanks so 
much.  Please let me know what you find out.

Sara,

Derek Lee left me a message this past Monday regarding repo agreements (I
assume for your London office).
Can you please let me know if he has received GSI Master Repurchase
Agreements or if I need to follow up on my end.
Thank you.
