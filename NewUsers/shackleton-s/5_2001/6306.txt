Nancy Callahan and I are agreed with respect to the Global Custody 
Agreement.  She will email the final version today and I will have it 
executed immediately.  Nancy suggested that I return the executed documents 
to her attention.  We will fax the executed agreement to you as well.  Laurel 
(713-853-7035) needs to hear from you how quickly we will be ready for 
trading.  Please give her a call if you have not spoken recently.  Thanks.

Just following up on the GTA information we will require to install GTA in
your office. I have attached the legal agreement and the surveys for stand
alone users and LAN (multiple) users. Please don't hesitate to call me with
any questions you might have.
