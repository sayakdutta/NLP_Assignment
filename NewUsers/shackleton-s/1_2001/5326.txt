This is a duplicate of the e-mail sent to you earlier today, WITH THE
EXCEPTION THAT the two Word Perfect documents are ALSO in WORD.

Attached are the blackline drafts of the Assignment and Waiver Agreement
and the RBC Swap Confirmation and a draft of the Pledge Agreement
between EAH and RBC.

The next round of drafts will reflect points raised on the conference
call today and points to be confirmed with Enron next week.
