Sara,
If you are going to email the agreement you can send it to Alejandro Espinosa 
and Francisco Ruiz-Tagle. Their emails are listed below. In case you are 
going to mail a hard copy I will talk to Francisco later today and get the 
correct address.
Thanks,
Gustavo

Gustavo,

CMPC would like to sell us fixed financial newsprint for 3 years (2000-3000 
tons per month).  I quoted a bid of $596/mt based on the RISI East index and 
$598/mt based on the PPW index.  Going forward all price questions should be 
referred to Jay, and the final price would need to be confirmed at the time 
of deal closure.

Alejandro and Francisco would like to review a draft of a contract, and a 
draft is currently being completed in Legal. You should call to confirm where 
they would like the legal documents sent.  I presume that they would like one 
set to go to their attorneys in NY and one set to themselves in Chile.

Their Contact information:





Thank you,


Scott Griffin
