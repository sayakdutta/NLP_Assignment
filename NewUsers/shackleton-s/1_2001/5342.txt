My intent on the Credit Worksheet was to only require guaranties and to set 
default perimeters (3rd party debt and S&P/Moody ratings).  I believe that 
this can be taken care of outside of the CSA.  Let me know if this helps.

Ed:  This counterparty does not want a CSA!!!!!!!!!  Can you please call 
Andre and discuss?  Sara
