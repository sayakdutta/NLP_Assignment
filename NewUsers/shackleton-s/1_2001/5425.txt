Sylvia:

Shortly Samantha Boyd will email to you two documents:  Enron North America 
Corp.'s final form of guaranty with most of your requested changes (the "ENA 
Guaranty") and a comparison of your guaranty markup against the ENA 
Guaranty.  I am hopeful that this will be satisfactory for purposes of the 
deal at hand.  Let me know if you have any questions or comments.  Thanks.  
Sara
