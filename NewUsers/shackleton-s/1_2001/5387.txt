Ed:

For purposes of this "omnibus" Transaction, Con Ed requests cross-default to 
ENA's guarantor and elimination of setoff for the non-defaulting party's 
affiliates.  Samantha needs a worksheet for the Transaction before she can 
prepare Annex B and B-1.
 We're sending tonight together with the ISDA Schedule and CSA.

Sam:  We need to use the same carve-out for setoff in Annex B-1 as in the 
Schedule.
