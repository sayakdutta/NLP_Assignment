 

Hello from Inside FERC,

(Sorry for the double send.  This version has the price form attached)

Tomorrow (Wednesday) is the last business day of October, and it's the fina=
l
deadline for Inside FERC's Gas Market Report's November 2001 bidweek
spot-price survey.

Attached is an Excel workbook (IFMONTH2.XLS) to report your price data in.

Please take a moment to review the instructions at the top of the file. The=
y
specify what kinds of deals to report and -- more importantly -- what deals
NOT to report.

Please note that a significant portion of our survey respondents are
reporting counterparties with their deals.  We want you to too. Please list
counterparties in the "comments" column. Counterparty information is held i=
n
confidence and not shared with third parties.

Reported deals with counterparty information are treated as more reliable
than trades without.

Please make sure to add the name of a contact person for your company and a
telephone number to reach them with at the top of your price file.

When you are done, e-mail the price workbooks back to both

Wednesday, Oct. 31.

November monthly prices will be published on Thursday, Nov. 1.

As always, thanks for your help, and if you have any questions, please feel
free to call or e-mail me at the telephone number or address below.


Best regards, and I hope you and yours have a safe and happy Halloween,.

Kelley Doolan, chief editor
