If he is coming into the office why don't you set up a schedule like you did for Morris including myself and Jim.

Tom




Thanks for the information Bill - hopefully Devon will let you go with a nice package.

Tom, I know you will be on vacation, but can you give Bill a call and arrange a time to meet with him either before you leave or after you get back.

Thanks,
Brian




Brian:
I met with Devon last week and it looks like the deal will close November
15th or Dec 1st. If we are able to agree on a position at Enron, the
earliest I could be available would be December 1st, if the deal closed on
schedule, the latest would be January 4th taking in consideration of the
Christmas Holidays. Brian at your convenience I would like to visit your
office and see your operations and meet Tom.  I will be available Thursday
and Friday of this week or the week of October 15th.

Thank you,

Bill
