No she has not called.  Thanks, you always seem to know the right thing to do.  Thanks for covering for me.

I wanted to let you know that I sent Elsa some flowers to her house yesterday.  Danny Conner said that she had surgery, and he suggested that I do that.  So just in case she calls to say "thank you," you'll know!  I hope she hasn't already done that, now that I think about it!!
