Fantastic!  I am happy that it ultimately worked out.  Welcome aboard.

Mr. Martin, 

As you can see from the e-mail address, I am now an Enron employee.  After we had last spoke, in November, I was contacted by the Analyst program and I asked them to keep my name in the database, just in case an opportunity were to arrive.  In April I got a call out of the blue asking if I was still interested.  I did have to think about the decision a little bit, but I figure that the opportunities for me here greatly out numbered those at Coral.  I accepted and as of April, 30, I am here in the East Power Fundamentals group on the 31st floor. 

I just wanted to give you an update, and I thank you again for helping me get into the Analyst program!

Sincerely,

Jason Kaniss
