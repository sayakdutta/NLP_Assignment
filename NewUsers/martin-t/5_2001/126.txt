Howard,

Just a quick update. I have spent some time this morning with Martin Thomas on this.

There now appears to be a slight technical problem with the numbers at present. Martin is speaking to Telecoms regarding this now. We will let you know as soon as we have an update.


Thanks & Regards

Morning Abigail, 

Have you had time to look into this for me?

Howard.


 

Hi Abigail, 

Sorry to be a pain.

With the FacSys users that you set up for me, would it be possible for them to be allocated an Oxford number rather that a London one? I believe that we have enough licences available.

Thanks
Howard Dunn.
