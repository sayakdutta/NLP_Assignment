This is very hard to read with all of the cutting and pasting.  I made one change to the definition of the 400,000/d of injection capacitiy.  Also I do not see anything that addresses how AEP deals with their June volumes in Bammel (assuming we never close).  We talked about them having to withdraw their volumes rateably starting on September 1 and concluding October 31.  Transportation rates would need to negotiated.
