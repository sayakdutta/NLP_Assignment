Thanks.  They are the same products.

Tom

 

Almost no notice is needed as long as the Products you intend to use are ones which previously appeared on EnronOnline.

Please note that Jan. 21 is a holiday, so we are planning on the launch of NetcoOnline happening on Tuesday, Jan. 22.

Thanks for the info.

Dave

 

Sorry, I thought you already had that info.  Phase 1 is the day we turn on EOL (January 21st), Phase 2 is February.  This timing should be consistent with the other gas regions.  Basically financial products first and physical products second.  If there is any changes between products in phase 1 and phase 2, how much lead time do you need?


Tom

 

Tom,

Thanks for the info.

What dates are you associating with Phase 1 and Phase 2?

Dave
