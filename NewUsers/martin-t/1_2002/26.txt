Thanks.  I got Jim's and Eric's right after lunch.  Jim was definitely not impressed but he said we would talk tomorrow.  Eric seemed disappointed but I think if we can bump his retention from $50,000 to $75,000 per six months, I think I can get him over the hump.  He is great value if we can get him for that.

We will have employment contracts done soon and employment letters to those not getting employment contracts by tommorrow or Saturday.

 


John,

You or Greg need to address the various groups with whatever generic information you can as to where we are in the process, expected timeline, hurdles before start up again, starting VAR and general organizational structure.  People are moving from frustration to feeling insulted that they are expected to sit still with no information.  I know you have a lot on your plate but if we really want people to hang in there a little longer before we address each individual's situation they need some sense of when they can expect closure.

Tom
