I have it in my briefcase, I just forgot to get it out.  Another slow day s=
o far.

I checked on the internet today about FannieMae and GinnieMae per Lisa's co=
mments the other day.  I learned that GinnieMae is a government owned compa=
ny that buys and sells mortgages for HUD and FHA loans.  They are basically=
 the financing vehicle for these low income housing loans.  FannieMae basic=
ally does the same thing but is a non-government owned company (used to be =
government owned in 1967).  Both entities have had a history of financing t=
he rebuilding of rundown urban areas in cities accross the country.  So Lis=
a's friend/relative used these entities in the correct way but who knows if=
 there is any truth to their future involvement in our area.  Based on some=
 of the stories I read they tend to focus on really bad areas.  My guess is=
 that on an individual house perspective these two entities provide a mecha=
nism to resale low income housing mortages in the secondary market.  So to =
the extent there are HUD or FHA loans in our neighborhood they are probably=
 involved in the ultimate financing of these loans but that is it.  I had n=
o idea what these two entities did, kind of interesting.
