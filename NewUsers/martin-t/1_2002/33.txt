I just read an article on the Blomberg news service that says that there are now six bidders and it is expected to go on into the night.  Each bidder is in a separate conference rooms and the lawyers are going from room to room to get the latest bid and provide updates as to what the best bid amount and structure is.  Sounds wild.
