Probably Thursday noon since some people are planning to be out Friday.

Tom, when do you suggest that I get everybody their boxes and move-packets?  I don't want everyone's things to be in the way, but at the same time, I don't want to wait until the last minute.  Daniel Muschar, with the IT group, sent me the email below.  What should I say in response to it?

Laura

 

Good day all:

What time can we start moving your groups this Friday?  
We are going to need as much time as possible.  I will need a time for each group.

Thank you,
