Irma,

I know you guys are vey busy right now on other matters but I am sure that you can appreciate my nerveousness about what you guys are going to me for me.  I still expect Enron to do the right thing a correct the error that was made prior to closing the Savings Plan for the change in administrator.  Please update me on your progress.

Thank you,

Tom
