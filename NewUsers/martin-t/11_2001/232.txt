That is ok.  I was concerned that it was something serious; sounds like little stuff.

Yes, I did....there seems to be some problems going on between the girls. I will explain more in detail to you later.  I think I have resolved it though.

Did you find anything out with Laura.

Tom

 

I just returned from lunch and was trying to figure the same thing out....I am about to talk with her and I will get back to you.

I went over to talk to Laura a little wihile ago and she was crying.  What is wrong?  Is there something I can help with?
