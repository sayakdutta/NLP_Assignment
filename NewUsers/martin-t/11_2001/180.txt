I left you a voicemail as well.  I just wanted to drop you a line to tell you that it appears the ESOP rollover into Savings Plan ocurred as we discussed last week.  I got into the Savings Plan on Friday 11/23 and moved the Enron shares to Stable Assets also as we discussed.  It appears that the price used was Monday's close of $4.01 instead of Friday's close of $4.71.

So where do we go from here?  I am assuming per our previous meeting that whether $4.01 or $4.71 is used; that one of these prices will be used to keep me whole versus a price sometime in September (probably September 30th) when the ESOP shares should have been put into the Savings Plan.

Please call me at you earliest convenience to resolve this.

Thanks,

Tom
