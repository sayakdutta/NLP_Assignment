I am telling the guys to use their own discretion about coming in tomorrow.  My guess is that most of them will not come in.

Tom ... I've ordered boxes, and they should be here sometime this afternoon.  It would probably be a good idea to have everything packed before you leave today.  I talked with Delores Sustaita w/the Move Team, and she said that they typically start around 9:00 ... but that might not necessarily be the time that you are moved tomorrow.  She said that they cannot guarantee when which group will be moved, and suggested that the groups not come in since you more than likely won't be able to log in to our computers for most of the day.  What do you think?
