Laura,

I can be reached at Home, Pager and Cell Phone in that order.  Also whatever happened to the pager invoice issue, did it get paid or do I need to convert to personal account to keep it?

Tom

 

For those of you who plan on taking vacation this week, please provide me with a number where you can be reached, just in case we need to reach you.

Thanks!
Laura
