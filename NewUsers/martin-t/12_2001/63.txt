John and Louise,

I am planning to be on vacation from Thursday noon 12/20 and returning Monday 12/31.  I will be in Houston the whole time and available to come in if needed to help out on Due Dilegence or other matters.  I can be reached at home 281-580-6280, cell. 713-417-7994 or pager 800-503-3208.

I have made arrangements for the curves to be updated daily.  If you have any questions don't hesitate to call.

Happy Holidays!

Tom
