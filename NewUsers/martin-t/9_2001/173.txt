I don't think we are interested in Hockey but Texans may be of interest.  Send an E-mail to Redmond for us to discuss.  Maybe we can share with another desk.

Tom, read below and let me know what you think!  

Also, would you like for me to look into getting season tickets for the Houston Texans?  I know that Jessica, Barry Tycholiz's assistant, purchased some earlier this year.

Mark Frevert has purchased 4 tickets for the Houston Aeros 2001-02 season, for use by all business units, the same way as the Astros tickets.  This is the Aeros first year in the American Hockey League.  Their first game is on October 12th, go to http://www.aeros.com/schedule/ to see the full schedule.

Our seats are located in Section 108, Row R, Seats 1-4.

If your group in interested in using these tickets, please give me a call (x33497).  

In addition, I have 3 invitations (each admit 2 people) to the "Meet the Team Party" on Tuesday, 2nd October.  If you would like to attend, please let me know.  The party will be held at the Compaq Center from 6pm to 8pm.
