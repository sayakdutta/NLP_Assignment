NOTICE TO ALL SHIPPERS:

There will be a mandatory E-SCRIPT upgrade on Tuesday, February 8, 2000.

This upgrade will take approximately 45 min. to download via the Internet
using a 33.6 Kb modem connection (which is typical for dialup customers).
Please note that Altra customers will require additional time to upgrade.
If you prefer, you may call the E-SCRIPT Help Line at 1-800-895-8899 to 
request
software for this upgrade. We will need you to leave your company
name, contact person, mailing address and whether you need a set of diskettes
or a CD.

The upgrade will include the following E-SCRIPT modification:

Users will be able to enter volumes in Nominations via the Daily Volumes Tab
for nominations in normal mode.  This will allow nominations for different 
days
of the month on an activity, rather than 'retrieving' data for each day from 
the
main tab.

As always, please call the E-SCRIPT Help Line with any problems, questions
or suggestions.

Thank you,

Twyla Strogen
Manager, Business Technology Services
