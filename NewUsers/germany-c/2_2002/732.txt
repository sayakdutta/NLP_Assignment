I am still having trouble but I don't know if its and Enron problem or an Iroquois problem.  I'm waiting to hear form Iroquois.  I would like you to check it out if you have time this morning.

 

Hi Chris, are you still having problems with a Citrix Client application?  Lemme know and i will stop by.
