I just received a copy of the executed Reliant agreement today.  Do you want a copy?

 

Also, please let me know what the global contract number is.  I want to write it on my copy.

thanks

 

Hi Chris,

This is just a reminder to please send me Shaun (?) Kilpatrick's info so I can contact her for a copy of the Reliant GISB we just signed.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!
