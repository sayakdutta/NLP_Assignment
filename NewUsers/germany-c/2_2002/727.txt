Daniel, please get us a conference room for 30 min Monday afternoon and email everyone with the details.

Eric, you don't need to be there, I'm just keeping you in the loop.

Kay, per my voicemail, I need to meet with you, Ed, Shemin, and Wade to discuss how to handle producers that are still "attached" to ENA's pools on Dominion Pipeline.  This should be a short (less than 30 minutes) meeting.  Shemin and I are available anytime Monday after lunch.  I believe Ed is available after lunch as well.  Please let Daniel and I know when you are available after lunch on Monday and Daniel will get us a conference room.

Thanks
