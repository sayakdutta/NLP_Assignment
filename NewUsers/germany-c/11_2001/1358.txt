Did not sell the truck.  They are putting flowers all over it so you and the
little woman can live in it like flower childs.





cc:



We had a meeting this morning at 7:00 am but we didn't find out anything
new.  Right now it sounds like its business as usuall for the next 5-7
months.  I had a jury duty summons this morning.  I didn't get picked and
we got out at 1:00 PM.  Sell my truck yet?

    
            
   Hey Bub,
