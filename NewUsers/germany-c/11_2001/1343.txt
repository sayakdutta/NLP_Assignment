Thanks.  I appreciate that.  It is a bit gloomy and MOODY over here.  I don't think too many people are excited about Dynegy but its better than bankruptcy.

And I do appreciate the job offer, its just hard to do with a family.  But I will chat with my significant other and see what she says.  I've asked her about moving before and I thought she was going to hit me.


 

Hey Chris,

I hope the madness that's been occurring over there isn't weighing you down
too much.

I just wanted you to know my offer stands if you'd be interested in looking
at moving to LA to manage our T&E.  Our asset base has been growing and we
are looking to expand some more. Your expertise would be tremendous.  Let me
know.
