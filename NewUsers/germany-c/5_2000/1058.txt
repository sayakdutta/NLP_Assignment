Do you have a home for the T&F Explor behind Penn Fuel for June?  

I left a message for Charlie at CES this morning about all the other citygate 
production.  I'm also trying to get a bid from CNG for the month of June on 
the EOG and 
Peoples gas.  I'll keep you posted.

Do you have a current Citygate production worksheet?
