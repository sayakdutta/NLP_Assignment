I am pleased to announce that Terry Franklin will be joining the 
Transportation Rates team in a newly created position-the Appalachian 
Coordinator role.  Terry brings years of transportation, wellhead, and Enron 
experience to the position, and we are excited to have her join the team.

In her new position, Terry will be responsible for the following:

? Understand the Appalachian contracts/agreements
? Understand the gas flow methods and desired commercial results
? Facilitate set-up of transport/gathering contracts
? Facilitate set-up of facilities/meters
? Create purchase deals in SITARA
? Maintain transport rates coordination role for CGAS, CNG, CNR, etc.
? Review calc sheets
? Maintain purchase pricing
? Maintain intra-month volumetric estimates on CNR/Gather co

Terry will make every effort to trouble shoot and problem solve for both the 
commercial and operations teams.  In doing so, she will be looking to partner 
with the members of the Trading, Origination, Client Services, Volume 
Management, and Logistics teams to improve our processes in this very 
important area.   

Terry will be replaced on the Operational Analysis team, but we may choose to 
realign individual responsibilities to creatively manage the  current 
workload.  Terry will begin to transition over the next several days, but we 
must be very careful to maintain the current Volume Mgmt. OA process during 
this transition time.

Please join me in congratulating Terry in her new role!
