I hope I have the right Bob Hall.  I'm trying to get sitara access to the West and Texas Desk and they have not been approved yet.  I'm waiting for Phillip Love (now with UBS) to approve the West and O'Neal Winfree (not sure who this is) to approve the Texas Desk.

Tommy Yanowski was able to help with a couple of these but it looks like we need to get the approving parties changed.

I also left a message for the help desk about this.
