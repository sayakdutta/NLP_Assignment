This is my Reliant Energy schedule.  I send this to all the people you see below at least twice a week.  I'm only doing business with them at one point and they are making money off Enron.  But he has agreed to give me a little operational flexibility over the weekends if I need it.  I send them a wire every Thursday, unless its like this week where prices ran up and I had to send it on Wednesday.
