Thanks.  So far so good but I'm too damn old to be a dad.

 

I saw this one last week.....it's great!!!  Congrats to you by the way.  Hope all's going well.

 

Here is a funny right back at you.  This is what I plan on doing to my kid when it gets here in May.  I'm also going to duct tape its little hands just for fun too.
