I'm back and I'm gong.  My MSN doesn't work.  What time should I come to your desk?  

 


hey, if you can't make lunch you will want to see my new neighbor.
 

Hey team!  Man have I been waiting for this day.

I have a meeting at 9:00 AM this morning.  It's a meeting with lawyers so it is very possible that it will go through lunch.  Don't wait for me if you can't get ahold of me.  I hope to be there cause I wanna see JEAN, the light of my life.  Scott--- HANDS OFF JACK!

Later
