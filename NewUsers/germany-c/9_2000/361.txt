You De Man!







I'm trying to release capacity... what a scary thought. It's fun to try
other things!!!





There's always a profit in gen-tile and calm.  I'm Judy's boy.  I know
nothing about Vickie.

I thought Miss Vicki was your new partner???

Our bid week is very gentle and calm... how refreshing!!!!





I got no new partner, I;m a solo act.  Bid Week?  Crazy as usual.
