I'm having trouble getting off.  What time is the flight out on the 29th - 
that's my trouble day, the latter the better so I can be here in the morining.












Good morning, Chris. 

The hotel in NYC is available.? I'll look into alternate departure times on 
Jan 2 and let you know what I find.? Please check and see if you can get the 
time off.? I won't book anything yet.

Have a good day.??? ii
