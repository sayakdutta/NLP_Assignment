I will bring it and anything else I might have in tomorrow that I think you 
can use.  I will leave my sleeping bag in the car though.


   
	
	
		


I am going up somewhere near Austin.  Do you think it would be a possibility 
to borrow the backpack?  We're only going to be up there overnight so I 
shouldn't need to pack that much, besides I can't carry that much anyway.
