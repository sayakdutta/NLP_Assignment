find him in my email directory.

Re:  Texas Gas Transmission Fuel Retention Effective 11/1/00

On August 31, 2000 Texas Gas Transmission Corporation (Texas
Gas) filed revised tariff sheets in Docket No. RP00-518-000
to change the Effective Fuel Retention Percentage (EFRP)
under its Rate Schedule FT which Transco utilizes to render
service to its customers under its Rate Schedule FT-NT.
Texas Gas has proposed to change its EFRP from 3.37% to
3.27% for the Winter Season (November - March) and from
2.68% to 2.96% for the Summer Season (April - October). If
accepted as proposed, the revised Texas Gas fuel percentages
would result in the following changes in Transco's current
Rate Schedule FT-NT Fuel Percentages effective November 1,
2000.

Winter Season - 0.09% decrease
Summer Season - 0.26% increase

Please refer any questions to Risa Desmuke, Rate Department,
