Uhhhh - - - - - - -  Yea.  Whoo Hooo.  Hold me back.   I feel the excitement.

Just kidding, hope your day is full of wonders!!!











My flight is early Saturday morning... September 2nd. I should be home by 10
am. I leave late Monday night, 7 pm. I'll just catch a cab at the airport on
September 2nd and will probably leave my car at the airport on September
4th.

Thanks again for everyone looking after my cat. If the sale of my condo goes
as plan... I probably be back in Houston the following weekend to pack and
ship my stuff to Maryland. As these plans materialize, I'll let you know.

Alma, please continue to park in my space. I know you will have a rough
couple of months with your foot surgery. I'll just use your spot when I'm
home.

Thanks for everything... I'm so excited to come home!!!
