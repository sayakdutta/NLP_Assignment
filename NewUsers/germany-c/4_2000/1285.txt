If this is metered production then its not cut (it just flows to the pool).  
If its pool gas then it probably is cut, so you tell me.  Metered production 
or pool gas on CNG?

Hey John, give me a call when you get a chance so we can chat about this.  
Also, send me your phone number.  I can't find it.
