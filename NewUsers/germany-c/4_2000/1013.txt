I've been in you house since then.  I also have a doggie book in the back of 
my car that belongs to you.



You haven't seen me since Thanksgiving Day...you don't want to break your 
record now.....

C'mon - I want a free lunch.  I could interduce you to a new place, real 
close to work.




No, 'cause you can't type!
