No Burt Shears in our phone dirctory.  I also tried searching for just
"Burt" and "Bert" and nothing came up with the last name sounding, feeling,
looking, or smelling like a "shears".

When you have time can you see if you have a phone number (somewhere at
Enron) for Burt Shears.  A lady I work w/ needs it.   (it is a friend of
hers - I think.) thanks
