Victor, doesn't matter to me.  You pick - Mr. Goodell or someone else.










Chris - 
I've expired access to the four persons you requested be terminated.  Additionally, I need to update our Security Administrator records by replacing Dan Junek with someone else.... perhaps yourself.  At any rate, I need a name, business address, phone and fax number for the designated Security Administrator.  If questions, please advise.  Thanks, Chris.                  /Bob
