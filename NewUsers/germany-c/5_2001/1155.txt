I'll call later with a whole bunch of tedious contract changes.

 


It was nice of you to put thought and effort into those reviews.  Even if the process seems like a waste of time, you did your part!
I feel so blah today.  I'm tired and sad and have cramps.  I almost turned around and went home when I was on my way to work, but I have so much to do.  I'm hoping to just work quietly today, get my mind off my troubles, and get some things off my plate.
And I love my kitty cat.  He's my precious boo-boo.

Did mine.  Need to do one for this person in risk management.  I finished 
at 12:15 

     


         
   Did you finish all but your own?  Saving the best for last? 
   I guess you finished at 11:30.  Am I right? 
      
                    
     I finished all but one.  Guess what time I finished????  Oh, and we 
     have 
     until the end of today to finish them.
