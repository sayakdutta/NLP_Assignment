I put in a book request for the canada books two days ago.  I will check with John Valdes to see what the hold up is.  As far as the futures and options books, there should be one book for both.  If you have questions about that can you please call Errol McLaughlin directly?  Those are his books and I don't know how they need to be set up.

Thanks

Any updates on these issues?  Need to have the Canada P/B/I books details and also which book is for future and options.  We need this info before we can set up books in Netco production database.

Kam,

I will update the regions for the books.  Also please advise which gas book is for future and which one is for the options.  Same for commodity Crude, Unleaded, and Heating Oil (the future & options books for these 3 commodities could be the same and could be different.  But currently you only have 1 book set up for each of these 3 commodities).

Thanks
