Min,

Is this change only for those using EnPower?  My group will no longer be running any power books and won't need EnPower any longer. 

If this affects the gas applications in any way let me know, but I think that this won't be necessary for me.

Thanks

Dear Kam,

The Oracle Power database has been moved. The Excel Applications which are involved with the database need to be modified. So does your PCs' setting.

Please let us know when we can go to your desk for the changes. The time only need < 20 minutes.

Thanks!
