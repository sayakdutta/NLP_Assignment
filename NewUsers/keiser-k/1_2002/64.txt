Could you please each take a section of this spreadsheet and search tagg for any deals with these counterparties.  I need to know the exact counterparty name and if there are any deals with that counterparty for Nov-01 forward. 

Thanks
 



 

Kim, as part of the roll out plans we will need a summary report of the close out values for these customers.  Can you coordinate with credit, including the utilization of an analyst ( if you can find one). to complete this list.  

Cash means ( receivables, payables positions outstanding).
MTM ( the last MTM that we had with a company as we closed out).

The intent of compiling this information is to be able to position ourself for the appropriate conversation with this customer.... ( if Enron owes them money, we should know that before we walk in the door). 



Pls review and let's discuss....
