Zach,

Let's try for tomorrow morning around 9:30.  Stop by desk and we'll run through the basics.

Kam, 

No problem.  Just let me know when and where you want to meet.  Thanks for setting this up.  I really appreciate it and look forward to talking with you about what I will be doing.

Thanks,
Zac

 

Zach,

Can you get together Friday morning to go over the basics of what we do?  I will try to find some old class materials for you to review as well.
I will let you know when and where tomorrow.

Thanks,
Kam
