Columns A-E are the exact names and their risk type.  Column G-H will be the mappings for the gas daily mappings.

If you can wait until the morning, I will have a more complete list for you.  We have made a few changes.

I will send it ASAP.

Thanks

Kam

Z,

This is a list of the curves we will be using in Netco.  We may have some additional curves to add to this list but I wanted to get you something to start with.

Thanks

KK
