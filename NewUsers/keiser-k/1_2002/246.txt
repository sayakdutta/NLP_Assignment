It is the Import Gas Daily file under Curve Maint in Runm.  We are working on an excel file with the intra-month and gas daily curves and will send it to you when we are done and we can try to load them once the database is split.

Thanks

Can you specify which gas daily curve mappings.

We can probably load all of them up in excel.
You do your editing.
then we load it back into the database.


 

I think she is referring to the egs_gas_daily_pub_mp table accessed from runm->Import Gas Dly->Edit Mapping screen,
although I could be wrong - please have someone work with her - thanks.

 

Question:

Once the new database for ERMS is split for Netco. we will have to make some changes to the gas daily curve mapping tables.  Is there another way to create these mappings other than adding them one at a time.  We are getting rid of a large percentage of curves and will be making many changes to the current mappings.  Doing it one by one will be very time consuming and I want to see if you are able to load them another way.
