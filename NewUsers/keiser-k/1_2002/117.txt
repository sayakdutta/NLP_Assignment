We are working on this now.  We have a book with all physical active trades we will be performing on, we are now working on getting the in-the-money financial trades separated into a new book.  Once that book is ready and deals are moved, we will be able to report it to you.  

Thanks,

Kam

Any thing that is not terminated per legal.

I am sure they will want them split between in the money and out of the money.

So think about how we get there.

let me know

I know what we consider performing on the physical side.  What is considered performing on the financial side?????  

 

Hey guys,

Each book should have been split into 3 books - 

- terminated by the counterparty
- ongoing transactions (active) and
- transactions that have not yet been terminated by a counterparty but that we are not going to fullfil.

The DPR should only have the active transactions in it. Hope that clarifies!
