Kelly will be a power trader.  I don't know if she has any experience doing that.  
I haven't heard exactly why the weather group left, but many of the traders weren't happy that the move was a lateral one and didn't accept their offers.  I think that's what happened with them.  
Good luck with everything, it would be great to work with you again.

Is Kelly doing structuring over there or is it a risk job? Any details on the weather guy(s) walkout?  Sounds like a good opportunity but why did they all leave?  I wonder if they're starting up their own consulting company? I have a few things presently in the works. I'm hoping to touch base with Scott N. sometime today. Too bad I couldn't make a living by being a frequent job switcher.  I could be good at that.  Things would be a hell of a lot easier if I was willing to take a job out of state.  Lots available elsewhere..

See ya,

JR

>I don't have any contacts at Duke.  Kelly Little will be working there, but other than that I don't know anyone.  Have you called Scott Neal back yet?  We were just talking about that exact thing, we knew all the weather guys left and were wondering what they would do.  That would be a great opportunity for you.

>I have already applied there online last week but I am afraid that it may have gone into that great HR black hole. Thank you for the heads up, though.  Do you have any contacts there?  Scott Neal has been trying to get a hold of me.  UBS is looking for some weather guys because a bunch of weather people left there.  Now wouldn't that be funny if I ended up back there in a different capacity?
