Yes,

The first three legs are the purchase for 80,000/d.  Leg 4 is the annuity, and leg 5 is the put.

I don't think I know what you are asking.

See attached Summary Sheet, they all seem to be the same Tagg #'s with different legs.

It looks like legs 1,2,3 are part of the Purchase, while the other legs are part of the Resid Swap.


Thanks Russell
