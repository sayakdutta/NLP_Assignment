Arnold, Kevin Ruscitti, Brad McKay are the only ones so far.  I'm sure there are a few more I don't know about yet.

How is your group looking, who's left, are you in charge now?


 

Who, so far, has decided to leave (besides John Arnold)?

 

FYI........

We will probably have some changes to the trader matrix, we have had some traders quit or decide to stay with the estate.  Once we know for sure, we will send you the new breakout.

Thanks,

Kam
