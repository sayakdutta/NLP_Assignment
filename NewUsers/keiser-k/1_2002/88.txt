How about tomorrow morning at 9:30?  I have a meeting at 10:00 and I'm clear around that.

Kam,
I need to spend about 30 mins with you on the automation process and that you agree with the way we are generating the risktrac book-id. Please let me know a convinient time to meet you.

Regards,
Ramesh 



Ramesh,
     I told her that it is O.K to change the name.

Thanks,
Virendra 




Could we change the gas daily intra-month and index to GDM and GDY, rather than GDL and GDX.  Tell me how much trouble that is to change.  IT also made some changes to the physical org region names.  I will have to get you those changes.

Thanks

This is a list of RisktRAC book-ids corresponding to what has been created in ERMS. Let me know if the book-id naming is ok with you.

Regards,
Ramesh
