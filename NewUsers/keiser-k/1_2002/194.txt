Tracey,

We will have to change the org_region codes for all of our books today.  I will send you the updated book requests today once IT has agreed to the changes.  That should solve your problem.

Thanks

Kam

 

Can you figure something out for these guys?

Thanks

Jeff,

I have a concern regarding these new book requests for netco.  As you can see from the attached files, all the firm books have the same book code, "MF".  When accounting pulls the liquidations from TAGG, it is by book code and region.  When we pull the "MF" book code with "Financial" as the region, we will be getting the liquidations for John Arnold's book, Mike Maggi's book, etc.  We will have no way to determine which liquidations belong to which book.  I just have a concern that if/when we have variances we would not be able to determine which trader's book was the cause of the variance.  Do you know of another field that would provide this information?

thanks


 

Here you go!

 

How about Canada?

John
