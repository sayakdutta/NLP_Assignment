Attached is a spreadsheet representing additional Counterparties who have terminated their relationship with ENA.  There aren't enough deals to involve IT, so can you please have your Risk groups move the attached deals to the Bankruptcy books.  

(There is a tab for Nat Gas and one for EIM (Paper))

Thanks,
