Torrey,
 
We have taken over the responsibilities for setting up new books so we will be learning that today.  These books should be ready by Wednesday.  I will know more after we speak with them today.
 
Once they are ready, we will send you the matrix you forwarded me.  I have a question about that, you have a column for TAGG financial and physical.  What is the difference? 
 
Thanks
 
Kam

Hi Kam,
 
As per our discussions last week, I have attached a trader/book association table for U.S. Gas. If you could get the desks to fill in the appropriate information for the new books, Tara and I will get the data set up in EOL for product selection and testing.
 
Thanks!
