Sorry, these have been fixed.

Kam - these deals were zeroed out for all months, not just Dec-01.  I need the demand charge put back in for the missing months:

CP		Deal		Amount		Month(s)		Fee Type
NUI Utilities	715090		$9,958,461		11/01			Demand Charge
VNG		602020		$161,901.45		5/01 - 11/01		Demand Charge
