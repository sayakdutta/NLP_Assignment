I'm about to send this.  This counterparty name was inactivated and we had to manually change the name on about 200+ deals.




 

Please let me know where we stand on this.

Thanks

If possible, please forward these MTM values to me by the end of the day.  I'd like to get back together for a short meeting tomorrow to discuss the values and make plans for next steps.  Tina Holcombe will send out an email for meeting time later today.  Thanks.

I am forwarding Harlan's schedule of termination dates for TXU.  Please calculate our MTM values on those dates as soon as you can, and forward them to me.  Thank you.
 

Give me a call if you have any questions.  I guess the next step is to clean up a few items on the attached spread sheet and then assign a value to each contract.  We need to come up with a plan for factoring in LDs with the MTM exposure.
