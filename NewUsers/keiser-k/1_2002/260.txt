We have a copy of the p&l format we will all be using saved in O:\erms\erms_adm\Netco\blank P&L.xls.  If you are setting up your formulas you can use this format to create all your links for the new NGP&L and then change them to the individual p&l's later, we will be deciding how to break out the traders sometime this week.   

Attached is a list of the book names and the traders associated with each book.

 
Let me know what you guys need to get all of this set up this week.

Thanks

Kam
