Kim, as part of the roll out plans we will need a summary report of the close out values for these customers.  Can you coordinate with credit, including the utilization of an analyst ( if you can find one). to complete this list.  

Cash means ( receivables, payables positions outstanding).
MTM ( the last MTM that we had with a company as we closed out).

The intent of compiling this information is to be able to position ourself for the appropriate conversation with this customer.... (if Enron owes them money, we should know that before we walk in the door). 



Pls review and let's discuss....
