Errol,

Here are the bankruptcy post-id's that need to be calculated tonight.  You probably don't have access to the Canadian book so you can get it from Jeremy or use my computer.  The right one has portcalc up, kkeiser & tamu96ddd.

They might need to be on inexact for basis and index.
Once those are done, can you email the id #'s to John Powell, Debbie Brackett and Stephanie McGinnis?

Thanks

Kam
