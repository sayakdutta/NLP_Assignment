Here is a list by risk type that we plan on loading with UBS.  There were some name changes to a few of the west desk curves.  
Lt me know if you have any questions.

Can I get a copy of the curves we plan on trading in NETCO.  Please make it as comprehensive as possible as we need to make sure all are mapped.
