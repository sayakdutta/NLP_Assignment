Hey,

I am going to have to miss your wedding.  Unfortunately, I will be in Plano that weekend.  I wish I could make it.

What's going on with the UBS weather position?  Has that gone anywhere or are the other possibilities you had better?

Talk to you soon,

Kam





Hey guys,

I am being told by my better half that we need to get an accurate head
count of who will be attending our wedding.  If you would be so kind, could
you possibly let me know of your status over the next couple of days?  For
those of you who already sent us an RSVP response recently, please
disregard.

Thanks for your help!

Jeff
