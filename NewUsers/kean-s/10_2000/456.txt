Please get the list of people I interviewed (and their resumes) from Allison 
Bailey and confirm with her that if the attached spreadsheet shows a "y" next 
to their name that means they received an offer (if "n" then no offer).  I 
would like to email those i interviewed who recieved offers

Please call or e-mail candidates who have received "offers".All of your hard 
work paid off - you have a great list of "offers".  These students have all 
been called and will receive a letter/packet by the end of the week.
