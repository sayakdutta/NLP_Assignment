Dear Steve:

This is to inform you that your subscription to Harvard Business Review is up 
for renewal.  In the past, such renewals were routed to Info Central to be 
paid.  Our department has changed its focus to research.
If you would like to renew as a courtesy, we would be happy to take care of 
this for you.  We will contact the publisher and let them know that for the 
next renewal to send the invoice directly to you, and from then on, you would 
take care of payment.
Please let me know if you would like to renew this publication.  If you have 
any questions, please do not hesitate to call me.

Sincerely,

Susan Kennedy
