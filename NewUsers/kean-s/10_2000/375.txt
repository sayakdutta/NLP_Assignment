Peggy -

Here is a draft press release which we intend to release before the market 
opens tomorrow, October 5, regarding the price for TNPC's stock.

It is my understanding that this is the format that complies with SEC 
requirements.  I have worked with Marc Manly in our office and David Stone of 
Vinson & Elkins.

Call me if you have any questions.

Gael
