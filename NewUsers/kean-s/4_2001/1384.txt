Congratulations on your appointment by Fox.  That's great news.  I continue 
to be impressed by the way Fox is handling things.  Let me know what I can do 
to help.  As you know we are looking for a replacement for the unreplaceable 
Ricardo Charvel.  I know you and he have discussed some possibilities.  Rick 
Shapiro has met several candidates and will be bringing two to Houston in the 
next week or so.

Dr. Kean continues to improve her golf game while I slave away at Enron to 
cover the greens fees.  Let me know when you are coming to town next.
