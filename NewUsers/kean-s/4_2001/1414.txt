I would'nt have it introduced by the "corporate policy committee".  I would 
say Enron is introducing or "there is a new tool available to you".  I am 
anxious to see how this goes over; it's a great tool.




Karen and Steve,

Could you take a quick peek at this and let me know if you have any thoughts 
or concerns?

Thanks,
Karen
