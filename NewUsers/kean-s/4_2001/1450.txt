Dear Joannie,

Minister Luhut Pandjaitan will be attending the USA
Meeting 2001 in Washington, DC over the next two days.
 He has requested a bilateral meeting with Mr.
Skilling, and would like to arrange a time (it is no
problem to find a meeting room here at the Chamber on
either April 4 and 5). If it is easier, you can reach
the Minister's accompanying advisor, Mr. Mani Maren,
directly at the following mobile number:
++62-81-693-0637. Alternatively, please feel free to
call me in order to confirm a meeting time
(++41-79-615-1612). The Minister is available
throughout the day on Wednesday, or early on Thursday
morning.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,
Swathi Kappagantula
