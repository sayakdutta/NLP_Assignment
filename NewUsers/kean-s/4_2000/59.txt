do I need to do anything?  I believe the only transaction I had was related 
to a set of shares which were released to me earlier in the year.  Some of 
the shares were sold at that time to pay the income tax on the distribution.  
We discussed this before and my recollection is I did not have to make a 
filing.  Could you confirm by e-mail?
