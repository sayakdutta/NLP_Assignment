Steve, I think we have consensus on how we would like the part ttime people 
handled in the PRS process for mid year.....okay.

Cindy I chatted with Elyse (Elizabeth Labanowski never returned my calls or 
messages) on the pt/rh issue.   Elyse is in favor of having the pt/rh 
employees in the regular PRC process, with education for managers and at 
facilitator training and a statement in the ground rules to ensure that they 
are not penalized or otherwise disadvantaged by the process.  

David and I discussed this option which he is in favor of it as well.  In the 
meantime for year end we will be ready with a system change to allow us to 
see pt/rh employees on the screen segregated from the full timers- and to 
have a live chart of pt/rh employees as well as the full timers.  We can't do 
that for mid-year because it requires a good deal of programming, but it is a 
feature we can incorporate at year end.  

what do you think?
