Sorry for the delay.  I have asked the question and should have an answer in 
a day or two. . . .  don't do anything rash in the meantime.

Hi Steve.  I know you are extremely busy  but I was just  wondering if you 
found out about whether the 3 year period apllies to all  options or just the 
ones in that program.  Question 2)  does the 3 year time frame apply to only 
options that are vested at the time of departure or does it apply also to 
options which vest over the 3 year time frame.  I look forward to hearing 
from you.  Thank you.
