We are concerned about leaks to the press which may have ocurred from our 
Washington office over the last few months (including leaks from a former 
employee).  Could you put someone in touch with Rick and Linda Robertson 
(head of our DC office)?

Should I also talk to Brindell about possible inside leak?  anything else I 
need to do relative to security ?
