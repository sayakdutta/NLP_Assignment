Sorry, I got overwhelmed by California.  I have not talked to Ken yet and 
will be in Japan until Friday.  Perhaps we can hook up then?




Steve,

We never closed the loop on Kissinger.  If you are around next week, why 
don't we talk and resolve what we want to do so that I can proceed?  Does 
that work for you?

Rebecca
