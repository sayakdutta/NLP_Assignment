I'm envious.
See you when you get back




We're going to be two ships passing here.  I leave town on Friday and return 
to the office on Wednesday morning.  How about I give you a call when I get 
back.  I am only in a few days and then I am heading to DC for my son's 
college graduation exercises.  ( I know exactly what you are thinking - 
Lordy, she's old!!)

Talk to you then, okay?

Rebecca

 

Sorry, I got overwhelmed by California.  I have not talked to Ken yet and 
will be in Japan until Friday.  Perhaps we can hook up then?




Steve,

We never closed the loop on Kissinger.  If you are around next week, why 
don't we talk and resolve what we want to do so that I can proceed?  Does 
that work for you?

Rebecca
