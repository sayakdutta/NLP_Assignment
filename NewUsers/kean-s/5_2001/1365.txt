PLEASE LET US KNOW YOUR AVAILABILITY!

The Environmental Strategies Group will convene an "Emissions Strategy 
Meeting" in mid-May to discuss global emissions issues -- such as climate 
change and U.S. multipollutant legislation -- and explore some of the 
potential business opportunities for Enron commercial groups.

The primary objectives of the session are to 1) provide you with the latest 
information on emissions regulation, markets, and Enron's advocacy efforts 
worldwide and 2) receive feedback on your commercial interests and input on 
policy options so that we may develop the best business and policy strategies 
for Enron in both the short and long term.  We invite you or a member of your 
group to participate in this important strategic discussion.

Our target dates are May 16, 17 or 18 in Houston (likely time is 10 a.m. - 2 
p.m.).  Please respond immediately with your best available dates so we can 
finalize our arrangements.

Please review the attached invitation and preliminary agenda.  If you have 
any questions or suggestions in advance of the meeting, do not hesitate to 
contact me of Jeff Keeler.

We look forward to your participation.
