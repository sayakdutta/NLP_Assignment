Thanks for your interest.  We have asked Cindy Olson to take the lead on forming this group, so I am forwarding your message.

 


Hi,

I would like to participate on the Employee PRC Committee. I am an analyst who has been at Enron for two years. I have recently come out of a group where I think the PRC process has been misapplied not only to me but many others. I think there is too much "smoke" in this process, especially at the analyst level where we don't participate in PRC meetings even at the group level. I have many other concerns about the current process that could have me typing away here for the next hour , so please consider including me in this.

Thanks,

Avinash Jain
