Steve - 

Attached is suggested language for our updated travel policy.  Our plan is to send out the update via email and to post it on home.enron.com under "new and notable" as well as on the Corporate Security website under "bulletins."

Please let us know if you would like us to change anything or if this is what the management committee had in mind.  Thanks!

Laura
