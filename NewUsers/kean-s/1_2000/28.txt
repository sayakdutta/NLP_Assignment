I won't be able to attend.  Let me know if I need to be hooked up by phone or 
if you will just brief me afterward.

Sierra called today to inform us that they intend to complete their internal 
review of the Oregon PUC filing by the beginning of next week.   They want 
our input by the end of next week, and to that end are scheduling a meeting 
in Reno for either 1/5 or 1/6.  Please let me know if you plan on attending 
the meeting.
