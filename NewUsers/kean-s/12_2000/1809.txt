The Governor cancelled the meeting at the last minute.  Apparently, he was 
trying to schedule a meeting with Clinton and our meeting conflicted, so we 
were bumped.  We are trying to set a new time.  I will share with the 
Governor's energy advisor the information and recommendations all of you 
helped put together.  Thanks
