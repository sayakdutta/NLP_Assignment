I like it.  Do you think we could aggregate information regarding EES' demand 
side management opportunities and prepare a release announcing the results of 
those efforts?  Normally, we wouldn't do such an announcement without a 
specific deal to report, but in light of the special circumstances in 
California perhaps we should consider it.

The CEC is scheduled to vote tomorrow on ENA's Pastoria project.  The 
attached news release has been prepared in anticipation of CEC approval of 
the project.  Although the CEC will issue its own release, ENA's release 
references the Pittsburg project and also our other plans for generation in 
the state (which will give us a chance of better coverage from California 
reporters).  If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know by 10 
a.m. Wednesday.

Thank you.
Karen
