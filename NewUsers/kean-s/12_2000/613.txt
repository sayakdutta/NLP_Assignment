Attached is a brief overview of the EGM business (I realize you probably 
already have this, Lisa).  This organization represents perhaps the biggest 
near term earnings growth opportunity we have as a company and one that will 
require our organization to develop expertise in new markets, new regualtory 
fora, and perhaps new countries.  From time to time, I'm sure we will all be 
called on to help out, so I'll endeavor to pass on any info I receive.

Steve,

Attached, for your information, is  a copy of a general presentation that I 
prepared to illustrate and describe EGM's businesses.  This is a presentation 
that will become a "living" document to communicate our businesses and 
growth.  I will be making numerous changes as we move closer to the analyst 
meeting in January but I wanted to give everyone a copy of this version.

Please don't hesitate to call me if you have any questions or comments.

Mike
