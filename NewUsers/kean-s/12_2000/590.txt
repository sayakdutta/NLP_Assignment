Steve,   As we just discussed, this is the transition memo suggesting that  
you place a call to Clay Johnson.   As noted in the memo, we are still 
working through with the lawyers what leave status our employees would be 
required to take while serving on the private transition and the publicly 
funded transition.  The answer to this question may determine their 
willingness to serve, in some cases.
