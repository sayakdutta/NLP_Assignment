Rich, I am on a leave from LeBoeuf and working on the Transition Team as part 
of the Energy Policy Group for the next few weeks.  We request Enron's views 
on electricity issues.  I regret the short notice and tight deadline for your 
response (Monday COB), but time is short and there is a need to flesh out 
Administration positions and prepare nominees.  Please consider responding to 
the questions as an attachment to your response, which should use the 
requested template.  Until we move in the D.C. Transition office on Monday or 
so, the best way to reach me is cell phone (202-255-6803) or email.  
Regards.
