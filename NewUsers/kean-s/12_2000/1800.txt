Michelle - I think Linda would fill the spot you and I talked about very 
well.  Linda is the new head of our DC office; she was asst secy of treasury 
under Bentsen, Rubin and Summers.  She is very well respected in 
washington.  She received the Alexander Hamilton award fro Secy Summers -- 
the highest award presented by the US Treas dept.  She has gotten up to speed 
very quickly on our issues and I think would serve the progam well (and she's 
already paid for!!).

Linda and I made a courtesy visit to Jim Derrick last Friday.  Jim suggested 
that we contact Michelle Cash about participating in the law conference on 
the program.  I called Michelle to inquire about the program and she told me 
that you and she had already spoken.  Linda is not seeking a place on the 
program, but will be pleased to participate if our decides to make a 
presentation.  Let us know how you want us to handle.

Thanks - Chris
