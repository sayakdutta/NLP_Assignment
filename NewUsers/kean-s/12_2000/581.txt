key members I recall are: andy fastow, gene humphrey,cliff baxter, ken rice, 
rick causey, lou pai, kevin hannon.  it's easier for me to remember those who 
are still around and in leadership positions as these folks are.  it's also 
interesting to note that with the exception of rick, gene and andy, all of 
these guys were in other parts of enron but were attracted to jeff's team by 
his vision for a new approach to the energy business.

Hi Steve,

Cindy Olson referred me to you, suggesting that you would have the 
information mentioned below.  Enron University Affairs, Ken Lay, Jeff 
Skilling, Andy Fastow and Gene Humphrey have been working with Harvard 
Business School, specifically Chris Bartlett and Meg Wozny of Harvard, on a 
case study of Enron.  This study is in its last phase and the only 
'roadblock' is gathering additional information.  In particular, Harvard 
would like 'a listing of key members of ENA, particularly Skilling's early 
hires.'  

This information will help facilitate drawing an effective comparison of the 
'old' Enron and the 'new' Enron.  

Let me know if you need any additional information.

Regards,

Cindy Derecskey
