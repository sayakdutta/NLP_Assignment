URGENT ACTION REQUESTED

On Thursday, September 14, the Subcommittee on the Constitution of the House
Committee on the Judiciary is slated to consider H.R. 4908, the Notice of
Electronic Monitoring Act.  H.R. 4908 is sponsored by Subcommittee Chairman
Charles Canady (R-FL-12) and cosponsored by subcommittee member Bob Barr
(R-GA-7).  The bill would require employers to notify employees about
electronic monitoring.  The National Association of Manufacturers urges its
members to notify their employees about internal monitoring practices.
Nevertheless, H.R. 4908 is being placed on a fast track that could allow for
many unintended consequences.  The NAM urges you to contact the Subcommittee
on the Constitution at (202) 226-7680 and subcommittee members (see below)
to urge postponement.

Message:

The September 6 hearing on H.R. 4908 was not well advertised and did not
include the views and concerns of employers.

Because of the nature of computers and other electronic equipment, any
"electronic monitoring" bill has to be carefully written so that it does not
interfere with other fiduciary and legal responsibilities of employers.

This is far too important an issue to "rush through" the process.

For more information, call Larry Fineran at (202) 637-3174 or e-mail him at
