No special requirements, but it's good to keep track of in case we want a 
point of contact.  Thanks

Steve,  a recent hire within my group of Risk Management ,  Samuel  Harrell  
is on two energy associations.   They are the  Association of Energy Services 
Professionals International (AESP) and the American Association of Blacks in 
Energy (AABE).  Sam is a member of good standing in both and has recently 
been nominated to join the Board of Directors for the AESP.   I was not sure 
if Enron had any special requirements concerning registration of employees in 
associations or not.    If I need to do anything specific I would appreciate 
your guidance.  Hopefully this will work as the needed notice.    Thanks
