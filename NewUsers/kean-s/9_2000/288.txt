attached is a copy of my california testimony.  The proceeding was somewhat 
productive, but turned into a witch hunt at a couple of points.  Our view on 
this is:  the problem is fairly straightforward (demand increases and new 
supplies are inhibited so prices go up and shortages ensue ... sound 
familiar?) and the solutions are straightforward (site the power plants 
suppliers are begging to build, let the utilities hedge outside the exchange, 
and finish the job of opening the interstate grid so power can get from where 
it is to where it is needed).

What it comes down to at this point is FERC is the only entity with the 
authority to start fixing this problem now:  Congress isn't going to get 
anything done this year and the California legislature is (thankfully) out of 
session now.  Our political leaders need to give FERC the room they need to 
act.

Good luck on your speech and give me a call sometime.
