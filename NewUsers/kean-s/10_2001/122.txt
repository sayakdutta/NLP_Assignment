What do you know about this guy?




Hi, Steve.  I hope all is well.

Jeff wanted me to ask you about Wallis Jefferson.  Apparently, he's running 
for Texas Supreme Court and he wanted to know if this guy "lives the 
values," so to speak.  He hasn't called him yet, but just wanted your 
perspective on him when you have a chance.

Jeff is traveling at the moment, but you can e-mail me or Jeff directly at 


Thanks for your help.  SRS
