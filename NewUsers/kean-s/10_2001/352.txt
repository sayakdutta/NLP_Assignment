Yes.  Irwin knows Enron and is very amusing




Steve,

I'm looking into Siegel's availability now.  Do you consider Mr. Stelzer a strong alternative to Freund or Siegel?









Freund is very good, but Siegel is more on top of things; his book is very 
good. I am better than both and wouldn't have the nerve to charge you.
