Thursday is fine.  Let's talk about the proposed expenditures.  We will need to prioritize.
 

Steve - the upper part of the document was prepared by my group.  The lower half was done by Donovan.  We were scheduled to meet with you on Monday and were going to incorporate the oil spill cleanup meeting.  With respect to that, we have the international solution ready.  We took it upon ourselves to address the same issue with the domestic pipes and Kyle found Phil Lowry to be extremely interested.

Regarding the meeting with our group - could we do it Thursday if convenient?  A couple people will be out tomorrow.  Thanks again very much Steve.
