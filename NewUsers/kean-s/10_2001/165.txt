Redraft (confirm):

	Late on October 25th, we received information about a possible threat to the Enron Center.  We are in communication with law enforcement authorities who have informed us that the threat is not specific and is unsubstantiated.  Nonetheless we take all threats seriously and have increased the security presence at the Enron Center still further.  In addition, today's Big E Cafe event has been cancelled.

	Once again, if you observe suspicious behavior, please call security at 3-6200.

Therefore, we have increased the security posture at the Enron Centers, including an increased HPD presence.  

	We will keep all employees apprised of any new developments as they occur.
