I assume you get these; if not, you should make sure you are on the list.
 

We have been notified by Trizechan Properties that there will be a scheduled shutdown of all electrical service at 3 Allen Center on October 27th at 4:00 P.M. The outage is scheduled to last for approximately 4 hours. I will forward any additional information I receive.
