From Dan Leff:

A California discussion meeting has been scheduled for Monday, January 22, 
immediately following the Executive Committee Meeting (approximately 12 
p.m.).  
Thank you.

Dan Leff


Rosalee - Can you please let me know if the Board Room is available for this 
meeting (it's late Friday afternoon and I am unable to find out this 
information).   I will call you on Monday.  Thanks for your help.
