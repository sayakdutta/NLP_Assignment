I spoke with Ken about the Business Council.  He agreed: errors of commission 
are much better than errors of omission.  H e does want to be personally 
involved in the invitations from here on and he is very willing to make calls 
next week to help get some confirmations.  Deal directly with him . . . 
there's no need for me to be in the middle.  Also, a bit of background:  
Greenspan is always invited to the reception the night before, but they don't 
want to offer him a speaking spot because he won't speak without the press 
present.  

Thanks again for all your work on the Senate hearing.  I felt overprepared -- 
which is just how I want to feel -- and every bit of information I needed was 
at my fingertips.
