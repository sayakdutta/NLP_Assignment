I think the documents look good.  I will discuss with Ken and Jeff (after 
finalizing a few outstanding items with these individuals).

Attached are the proposed letter to employees and response statement for any 
media inquiries.  Your comments and approval would be appreciated.  FYI, we 
have not had any more inquiries about Sanjay over the past two days and will 
not use either of these until you tell us to proceed.
