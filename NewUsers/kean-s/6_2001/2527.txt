Ken left a msg for me on Sunday.  He was able to return Bryson's call.  Not 
much new:

Ken got Jeff's paper
will try to reach Hertzberg on Monday.
Bryson gave an update (very consistent with yours on Fri)
Wants us to think creatively about "how to keep DWR contracts from preventing 
the comprehensive solution" and how to address the concerns of the state 
treasurer.
Ken tried to reach Pete Peterson (Blackstone) but did not make contact.
