I am contacting you on the recommendation of Pug Winokur, who is on our Board 
of Directors.    Enron has formed an Advisory Council which consists of 
academicians, public policy thinkers and media, together with Enron 
executives.  I would like to invite you to address the group on E-Commerce 
issues at our next meeting  (Friday, September 8th in Houston).

Attached is a list of our Advisory Council members.




I think you will find this group interesting and thought provoking.

Please contact me at your earliest convenience at 713-853-1586.
