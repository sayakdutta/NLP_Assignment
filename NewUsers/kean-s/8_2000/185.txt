See attached WSJ article, particularly the last paragraph.  The message is: 
there has not been enough deregulation;  the government is still very much in 
the way.  California is a perfect example:  the market has responded to 
demand increases with thousands of megawatts of new generation, but state and 
local officials have not sited them, and companies like Enron are offering 
price protection, but utilities are not allowed to take advantage.

Attached is an article about deregulation, price volatility, California power 
issues and how EES and other energy management type of companies are helping 
with solve these problems. 



Attached is an article about how PG&E is offering incentives to its larger 
customers in California that which asks them to use less energy, in turn the 
customers are guaranteed to be blackout free. There is a little controversy 
over this issue because the incentive is not offered to small business or 
residents.
