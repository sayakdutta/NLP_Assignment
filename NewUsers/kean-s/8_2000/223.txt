You probably saw the announcement that Mike Mcconnell is now CEO of Enron 
Global Markets.  EGM will be focussing on a number of new and existing 
markets (including coal, LNG, crude and products, interest rates, 
agricultural commodities, equities, weather, etc).  One of the markets Mike's 
group is actively considering is transport capacity.  I mentioned your work 
in the area.  He is anxious to see it and meet with you after he has had a 
chance to review it.
