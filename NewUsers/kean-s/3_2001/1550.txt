I just checked with Jeff and Ken.  They are both out of the office that day.  
Sorry it didn't work out.

Steve -

With respect to CK Prahalad's visit to Rice. As you know we are having a 
breakfast for the business community the morning of March 19 and he gives 
the Neuhas Lecture on Campus at 9:45 am.  Following the lunch there is a 
lunch with Mrs. Neuhas the donor of the fund and faculty.  That should be 
over by 1:15.  He has a date from two to five at Enron with Yeager (Steve 
or Scott).  He would like to meet with Ken or Jeff sometime that afternoon 
if at all possible.

Thanks for your help.
