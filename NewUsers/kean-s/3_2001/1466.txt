I would hold off for now.  I think, based on our discussion, that Ira might 
be a fit for my organization or EES.  Unfortunately, I am heading out of town 
with my family on the 12th (unfortunate for meeting with Ira , not 
unfortunate for me) and EES has new leadership who is trying to assess the 
state of things before making new senior level hires.  So, let's wait a bit.  
Thanks

Help -- pls help me to unscramble my calendar.
We had discussed Ira Jolles, now a vp and general counsel of GPU, due to 
resign when its merger is completed and the execs move to some God foresaken 
place in Ohio, or some such state. Ira is smart; innovatived; honorable; very 
knowledgeable about Pa. Nj, NY and Ferc regulation. In short, like no other 
utility executive I have met. He would be perfect for Enron, perhaps 
operating out of one of your offices in one of the states I have mentioned. 
You said that you would set up meetings with the appropriate people in 
Houston, and I propose April 12 -- I would stay over after our meeting and do 
the introductions. PLS let me know that this is ok.
