Steve's on vacation on April 4, 5 & 6.

Would the week of April 16th work?

I am working with Karl Gallant and Terry Allen (our outside counsel) to set 
up a day of meetings for Steve Kean with Republican Members of the California 
delegation.  Could you give me a couple of target dates?  Does April 4th 
work?  Congress is in recess the week of April 9th.  Thanks
