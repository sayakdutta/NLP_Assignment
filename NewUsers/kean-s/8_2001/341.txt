This is still confusing to me.  I have made a couple of suggestions, but I still have some questions (see attached).

 

 

Steve and Kevin, 

the following is a draft of an announcement communicating the transfer of responsibility for the corporate facility operations audit program to me.  Previously the program, although corporate in scope was administered in the ETS group.  Please review  draft and provide comments.  Thanks Mike Terraso

DRAFT


Responsibility for the corporate operational, environmental, safety and social audits of facility assets has been transferred from Enron Transportation Services to Corporate Public Affairs under Mike Terraso, Enron's Vice President of Environmental, Health and Safety and Chief Environmental Officer.  Directors of Facility Audits, Chuck Goode and Steve Allen will report to Mike and be responsible for leading the corporate operations management system audits of assets.  Technical experts from business unit operations and engineering will continue to serve on the multidisciplinary audit teams.
