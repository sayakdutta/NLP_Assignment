Steve..
 
I.m travelling and just picked this messahe up.
 
I don't know if Vince called you, but from a University Affairs perspective, (and I'm pretty certain A/A would agree) , Unless you just happened to be planning to be in Philadelphia, I would NOT feel any pressure to accomodate this 'Wharton energy club' speaking engagement request.  We've got a lot of exposure at Wharton already and I'd just assume save a request for your time for a more strategic opportunity.
 
In either case, let me know if you want me to respond for you.
 
Thanks!
 
--Christie.
