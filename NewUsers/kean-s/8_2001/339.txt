I've been thinking about the need to recast the "e-commerce" position as well.  I'm asking Maureen to get some time for us to meet (at Rice) in the next few weeks.




Steve -

We are beginning our planning for faculty recruiting for the fall of 
2002.  We tried hard this year to recruit a person for the finance (risk 
management) position and made an offer but he eventually chose to stay 
where he was for family reasons.  We will try again with him but will also 
widen the search again.

We will begin the search for the second Enron Professorship which was 
described as E-commerce.  Since we initially discussed this a lot has 
happened in the E-commerce world and we think it might be useful to 
re-designate the field a bit.  The use of the web and technology in 
business has become a critical part of the fundamental operations of the 
business and as we think that a professorship in operations management with 
a bent toward the use of the web and other related technologies might the 
educational needs of the students better and with better long term 
results.  Is this too far afield from the grant or do you think we would be 
in the general parameters?

Thanks.
