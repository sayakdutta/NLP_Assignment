I wrote some comments last night.  Maureen will fax this am.  As you will see, I have some deep concerns about the story -- content and the prudence of doing such a story.

Steve, you may be aware that we are featuring an article on the PRC process in the Enron Business that we're editing now. The issue is due to be published in two weeks.

Karen has made her comments on the story; I'd appreciate hearing what you have to say.

I haven't reviewed the story yet with HR (David Oxley is my contact).I've made sure that the story is balanced, accurate and fair. My fear is that HR will not want us to publish any negative comments on the process. If so, I think they would be overlooking an effective and credible method of communicating why the PRC process is so important to how Enron does business. 

Sarah has already discussed with Beth Tilney that we will publish another article in the next issue when the Culture Committee's recommendations on PRC are fully developed and ready to be implemented. 

We are working on a tight deadline, and I suspect the  review process will be lengthy. I hope you can return it sometime Monday.

Thanks,
Jeannie

Jeannie, et al -- I like this story.  I think it's very balanced, but very long.  Is there any way to break out a sidebar? Like maybe the PRC process -- what it's like in the room.  See my edits --- there are some holes, and i think it's too long on the anecdotes and quotes.  I'd like Steve to take a look at it.  Let me know if I can do more to help. thx. kd
