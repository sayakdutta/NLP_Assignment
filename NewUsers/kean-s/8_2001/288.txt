I seriously doubt it, but these people are relentless in wanting to schedule a meeting with Jeff (even though the dates they wanted to do it passed two weeks ago).  I received another call today.  If it wasn't E&Y, I'd just say no, but wanted to run it by you before telling them "absolutely not and please don't call here anymore!"  Thanks, SRS
