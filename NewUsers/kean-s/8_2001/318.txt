Somebody PLEASE help me.  How can Red Herring POSSIBLY give advice to Enron?!!!!

Red Herring's advertisement revenues in July were down 70% from 2K.  The pages that it runs ads on are down 77%. The circulation of 316,000 is lower than National Parks magazine, Muscle and Fitness, and 4-Wheel and Off-Road.

Enron lived up to its financial promises for almost 6 years straight -- EVERY QUARTER. Their revenues DOUBLED in 2K. They are # 7 on the Fortune 500.  They are moving 58% more product than 2K.  Their new weather, metals, lumber and steel divisions DOUBLED volumes in the second quarter from 2K.  Net income in the second quarter was up 40% from 2K.

Who's the "BURNOUT" here?
