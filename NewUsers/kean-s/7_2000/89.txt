In the underscored language added to the RTO section I would insert "access 
to" between the words "planning" and "maintenance".

I sent the following to Andy Black in order to ensure that we also discuss
the RTO/market power issues.  I'll bring copies to the meeting.  Please feel
free to take issue with the language.

Andy -

Thanks again for allowing me to participate in this afternoon's discussion.
As I mentioned, I believe discussions of transmission issues must include
both jurisdictional and RTO.  I understand that the RTO discussion is more
difficult in the absence of paper.  For that reason, I have taken the
liberty of drafting language that I believe mirrors (at least my view) of
one possible construct of RTO Proposal I.

I hope you find this helpful.  I will bring copies to our meeting tomorrow.
