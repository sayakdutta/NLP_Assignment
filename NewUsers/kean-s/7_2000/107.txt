The fellow from GE, Tim Richards, on this e-mail, is the person I have 
mentioned to each of you might be a worthwhile candidate for heading the DC 
office.   mcs

Joe,

Although I don't have his bio, I've known Herve Joanjean for about 10 years.
He has served in the EU mission t the WTO as a mid level market access
negotiator and in Brussels mostly on industrial goods market access
negotiations.  His move to Madelin's job is a lateral one from the
industrial goods side to the services side of DG-Trade.

In the mid 90s, I worked with Herve quite a bit and found him to be
trustworthy and conscientious.  He was a pleasure to work with, and although
we will miss having Robert in the Services position, Herve is a good
replacement.

Bob Vastine reports that Robert Madellin will be moving from the Services
portfolio this fall to Agriculture and some other high sounding
responsibility. He is being succeeded by Herve Jouanjean with Michel Servoz
as number 2. Does anyone have biographical information on Herve
Jouanjean???

Andrew Buxton who heads the European Services Network will be here for
meetings with CSI and ISACs this week and also in NYC with CSI and
Japaneese counterparts. Bob told me that Vivendi is the only energy
interest involved as members of Andrew's group and they have expressed no
interest in liberalized energy services. This would seem to be an
opportunity for the UK electricity association to advise him of their
interests and possibly the drilling people.

During the ISAC 13 meeting last week, USTR Peter Collins reported that the
WTO Working Party Dealing With China's accession had expressed concern with
the recent negotiation in which the Chineese won a series of exemptions and
in the case of energy services and possibly e-commerce there are price
controls.  We were told that a number of law firms in Washington are
opposing any USTR acceptance of this provision and Bob Vastine informed
ISAC 13 members should they have a view on price controls.

Trade Ministers will meet in September and are likely to ratify the China
accession regardless of the WTO Working Group issues.  You need to let us
know if Enron should consider filing a statement regarding price controls
for energy services and e-commerce services.

Joe
