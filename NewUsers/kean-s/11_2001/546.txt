Some good news.  Your call to Gov Rowland was helpful.  We are not finished yet, but we are on our way.

Steve/Rick - It appears that Gov Rowland is going to move this ball forward as he promised to do.  I have had several meetings since the Kean/Lay call with Rowland and the message from him has been consistent.  This is further confirmation.  Please call should you wish to discuss further.  SM
