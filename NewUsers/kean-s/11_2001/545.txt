In preparation for this Friday's Bank Meeting, we are in need of a comprehensive Question & Answer List for the Q & A session at the end of our presentation.  If you have such a list right now, could we use that as a basis for ours? Cheryl Lipshutz is spearheading our efforts.

The Bank Meeting is still scheduled for this Friday at the Hyatt, beginning at 8:00 a.m. and all of you are encouraged to attend.
