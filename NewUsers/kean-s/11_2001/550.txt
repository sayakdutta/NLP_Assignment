Steve:

Corporate Business Controls - Position Elimination - Portland Office 
I wanted to ensure that you were aware that John's group has one (1) employee (Chad Beers) in the Portland office who will be asked to relocate to Houston no later than 01/02/02, as the position in Portland is scheduled to be eliminated effective 01/02/02.  
Therefore, if the employee elects not to accept the position in Houston his employment would be terminated on 01/02/02 and he would be scheduled to receive the current business reorganization severance.

Based on this request, I plan to send Chad a Relocation Offer letter which also includes the information summarized above along with a severance calculation estimate.  

Could you please respond to this e-mail to indicate your concurrence.  If you do concur, I will proceed with associated paperwork.


Thank you Steve,
