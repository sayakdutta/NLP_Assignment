Thanks for thinking of us.  We have retained a crisis communications firm  -- Kekst &CO. -- to assist us.  They have extensive experience with the various challenges we are facing now and have been most helpful advising us and Ken.

defer to them.
As so, I?m including Steven Kean on this e-mail, because he is the one in
