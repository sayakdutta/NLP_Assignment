Irwin is on Enron's advisory council.  Could one of you send him a reply?




Sorry -- I was not cleaqr. I am after the company's value in the olden days 
when Ken appeared on the scene and you guys were still a small pipeline. My 
recollection is that something like $2 billion is the number, but I could be 
way off. What I am hoping to be able to say is that those investors who 
bought in at that long-ago time and stayed in have had their investment 
quintuple. Right?
