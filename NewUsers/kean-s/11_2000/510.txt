I will be getting back from Washington late today, but will be in early in 
the morning (evening your time).  Give me a call

Steve, 

Is it possible to have 30 minutes of your time sometime this week to discuss 
by phone an issue relating to the performance evaluation process?  Apologies 
for being cryptic - this is something that I had hoped to talk with you face 
to face about when you were in Tokyo.

kind regards





congratulations on a great launch!  The US press on the office opening has 
been great.  If you haven't seen it, get in touch with Ann Schmidt.

Preliminary figures for the Enron Japan website are looking promising. Since 
its launch on Tuesday, we have had 4000 page hits, with an average of 320 
site hits per day and an average stay of 20 minutes.

Advertising to date has been limited to the 300 guests at the office opening 
and the office opening press conference. We will be increasing awareness of 
the site over the coming weeks, mainly through word of mouth, and will 
finalize the articles for next month's edition in a couple of weeks.

kind regards
