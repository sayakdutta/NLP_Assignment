     Dan & Steve,
     
        This meeting is scheduled to be held on Friday 1 December at 
     McDonalds Headquarters in just outside of Chicago. People are flying 
     in Thursday night and we plan to go through most of Friday - maybe 
     with a tour of Hamburger University. The participants are General 
     Motors, Dupont, McDonalds, NASA, and hopefully Enron. I will be 
     traveling on Tuesday, but could we arrange a time to discuss this on 
     Wednesday?
     
     Rick Jones
