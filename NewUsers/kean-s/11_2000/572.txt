 There seems to have been a lot of confusion generated by the Worklife 
meeting announcements I've been sending. For some reason the dates and times 
I send are not the dates and times you all are receiving. At this point I'm 
not sure how many, if not all, of you have the wrong info. The meeting is 
scheduled for Dec. 5 from 9:30am to 11:30am in EB50M. There is no Worklife 
meeting today, Nov. 29. I apologize for the confusion. Please let me know if 
you are available to attend. Thanks, -Luke-
