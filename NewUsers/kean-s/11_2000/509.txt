Dear Mr. Kean,
In the effort to schedule the first meeting of the Advisory Board of the 
CEC's Initiative on North American Electricity Restructuring and the 
Environment we are proposing the following three dates:
1. Thursday January 11th, 2001
2. Tuesday January 16th, 2001
3. Thursday January 18th, 2001

Due to the difficulties with finding one date that will allow everyone to 
attend the meeting, we will select a date based on the greatest number of 
participants who can attend. For those who will not be able to attend the 
meeting on the selected date, we will try and find an alternative such as a 
conference-call link. 

The one-day meeting will take place at the CEC's offices in Montreal, Quebec, 
Canada, and the CEC will be happy to cover the costs associated with your 
attendence at the meeting. 

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact me at 

January.

Regards, 
Andrew Horsman
