Mr. Mitchell will not be able to attend the meetings in Texas on November
10, 2000 that were scheduled earlier this week.  He is assisting the
National Republican Party in resolving the issues that have arisen in
several counties here in Florida and has been asked to attend to those
matters again on Friday, November 10, so that the election process can be
completed.  Mr. Mitchell's assistant (Naomi) will call you on Monday,
November 13th, to reschedule this meeting.  Thank you for your attention to
this matter and we apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.
Naomi Olson, assistant to Stephen J. Mitchell
