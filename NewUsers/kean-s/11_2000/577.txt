Steve -

I think you sent this back to me by mistake and were intending it to go to 
you assistant.

I am scheduled to see you on the 5th.  I was just looking to get a little 
advice.  Rebecca has asked me to join her in EGA and I am fine with doing 
that.  I just wanted to pick your brain on longer term career things I should 
be thinking about.

Look forward to talking with you.

Chris





Thanks, I also need to get some time with Shawn Cumberland... please schedule 
that too.

SK - I emailed him and asked him to call me to schedule some time with you 
next week.  mm

Steve -

I was hoping to grab you for a few minutes in San Antonio to get some "Enron 
career advice" but wasn't able to find you at a time when both of us were 
free.  Any chance I could grab 20-30 minutes this week or next?

Chris
