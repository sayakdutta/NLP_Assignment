Michael Tribolet held a conference call this evening to discuss Enron Wind's 
legal obligations given SCE's non-payment.  In general, given the legal 
structure of Enron Wind, some action may be required from a partnership 
perspective.

The key next step is action on SB47 - Interim Short-Term Avoided Cost 
Methodology.  Enron Wind is unlikely to take any action if real progress is 
made by this Friday.  If not, a different action plan will occur.   This may 
change if other renewable QFs sue (for instance FP&L - who has retained 
counsel but don't want to be the first to take action).

They will begin to draft some pleadings to prepare for legal action (in case 
this is necessary).  

Michael Tribolet is on point to hear if EWC takes any action and we should be 
apprised before they move.
