Do we still want this?

I note that the HAWC and the Northeast Water Plant is on the Infrastructure 
Committee's agenda tomorrow at Houston City Council.

I am concerned about the proposed Azurix project with the Houston Area 
Water Corporation and the City of Houston. Two weeks ago I met with the 
Mayor and City Attorney on the Mayor's political business and they told me 
of their concern about the future of Azurix.  They wanted some assurance 
from Ken or Jeff that Azurix would be around as a part of Enron if it were 
awarded the Northeast Water Plant Project.  I believe they had some 
communications with Azurix officials but they really wanted to hear from 
someone at Enron.

I sent the word back to Enron through Joe, that someone high up should 
contract the Mayor and the City Attorney to give them whatever assurance 
they could concerning their concerns. I believe Joe discussed this with Steve.

Last Wednesday night I saw the Mayor and asked him if his request through 
me had any results.  Had he heard from Enron?  He said no, and that he 
needed to have some better feeling about the future of Azurix.

I assume we are working hard to get this project but based on my 
conversation I would think we need to give some communication to the Mayor 
from someone high up in the Enron organization.
