Steve,

Attached is Greenspan's prepared testimony before the Senate on monetary 
policy today.  I"ve highlighted the sections where he specifically addresses 
the impact of higher energy costs on the U.S. economy (manifested more 
through depressed aggregate demand in the economy rather than on inflation, 
which has remained well anchored).
