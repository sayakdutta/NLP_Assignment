ABX1 60 (Hertzberg) was just scheduled for hearing this afternoon in the
Assembly Energy, Costs and Availability Committee.  In brief, the bill
does the following:

Require, as a condition of certification by the CEC, that an applicant
offer to sell to an electrical
corporation, a municipal corporation, or the Department of Water
Resources, at a just and reasonable cost base price electrical power
generated by the facility.

This bill would also prohibit a person or entity, as defined, from
operating an electrical generation facility unless the person or entity
has submitted to the commission, within the time prescribed by
regulations adopted by the commission, a maintenance and outage
schedule, and the commission has approved that schedule.
