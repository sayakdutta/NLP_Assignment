Great summary.  I think the two main issues you raise are the right ones, b=
ut I have one other thought we should discuss internally.  Do we want to cr=
eate a set of incentives for the management of PJM that would entitle manag=
ement to incentive compensation to the extent they meet certain goals -- eg=
 relieving congestion on the grid, increasing throughput across the transmi=
ssion system, expediting interconnection (measured in terms of actual inter=
connections not just applications approved), etc.  This way we could create=
 an organization that would have the incentive to make a workable and open =
transmission system.
































Attached is a summary of the PJM RTO order.  While it is somewhat lengthy, =
the order has a lot of good information in it that I wanted to share with t=
he group, particularly the Commission's statements regarding the existing c=
onfiguration of the northeast and the need to expand it.

We are working on summaries of the New York and New England RTO orders and =
will have those out shortly.  If you would like copies of the orders, just =
let us know.

We expect the mediation proceeding to begin within the next week.  We will =
keep you updated.
