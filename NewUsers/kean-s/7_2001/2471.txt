See last point:  MIT would like to talk to us about energy procurement and 
management.  Could you put someone in touch with them?

Dear Jeff,

Thank you for inviting me to participate in the energy policy forum event
in Washington, DC on October 3-4.  Ordinarily, I would be happy to
participate.  However, my wife is scheduled to have hip surgery (#2) on
October 1.  Judging from the last time she went through this I will have to
stay around until she is out of the hospital and settled back at home.
Accordingly, I am not planning any travel before October 10.  Too bad.

On another matter, can you ask someone in your energy services company to
get in touch with me?  I would like to set something up with MIT's
executive VP in charge of the business side of running MIT, including
energy purchases and management.  We have a 22 MW cogenerator, buy gas and
electricity at wholesale and use lots of heating and cooling on an ever
growing campus with 8,000 students, as many employees, many computer
facilities and laboratories.  I'm sure that we can do it more efficiently
and I have been encouraging the management to look for opportunities to
out-source some or all of these activities.  I would like to put them in
touch with someone at Enron.

Thanks

Paul
