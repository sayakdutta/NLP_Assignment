looks fine







Steve and Cindy,

Attached is the electronic "Save the Date" memo for the Management Conference.  We are preparing to send it out next week.  Please let me know if you have any comments or concerns on the e-mail.  

As for distribution, we've worked with HR on the distribution list for VPs; but will circle back with David Oxley's team to ensure we have the most up-to-date list.  Since some VPs in redeployment will most likely find positions within Enron by November, I don't plan to exclude them from the distribution ... unlike United Way, where we are not soliciting employees in redeployment for a contribution.

I look forward to any feedback.
