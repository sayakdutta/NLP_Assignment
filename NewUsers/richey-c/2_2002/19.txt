try having no work to do for two months and then having to stick around and "appear" busy...  i know what you mean, in some ways its harder when you're not used to not doing things.  i've gotten good at finding things to do with my time, but when i first had nothing to do, i was going crazy.  fridays are always slow around here and i'm guessing its the same there, although i don't know cnrl specifcally, oil and gas producer/marketer?  

in terms of what i do, before enron went under, i was the short term alberta power trader.  since then, i have been champion internet surfer and investigating local coffee shops in an ever-widening circle.  although, things are looking up.  

eze is (i think) an earls nickname -- pronounced easy-e.  although, they may just call her easy for short.  i'm sure she loves both names very much.  

i have a very important meeting at 5 with my massage therapist and i was thinking about stopping by after that.  should i call eze's cell?  or do you have a cell #? 




 


You know what the worst thing in the world is?  Having no work to do on a Friday but being unable to leave for hours.  I've been here for three months and this is the first day where I haven't been busy.  This is a Type A's worst nightmare.  E-mail is my sole consolation.
So what do I do, you ask?  I'm in Gas Operations, the marketer's right hand man.  I do logistics, volume and supply/demand analysis, nominations, monitoring of accounts, damage control...you know, more or less hold the company together.  What exactly do you do over there?
Everyone always sees Emmy at Banana Republic.  She's a staple there.  Where did you get eze from?  I'm sure she loves it.  She never gets very flattering nick names.
Well, I'm going to take off for lunch.  What time were you thinking of coming down for drinks? 
Talk to you soon

hmm, synapses not jumping - i know the feeling,  i think i have three 
neurons firing in my brain this morning... 

i know what you mean about getting soft - when i went home to virginia for 
christmas, my mom was like "it's cold out, shouldn't you put a jacket on?" 
and having been toughened by the brutal calgary winters (in addition to 
being the super tough guy that i am) i did go out --- naked almost every 
day. 

let me know when you'er heading over to bass brothers and i'll meet up with 
you - i have a few things to do but drinks after work should fit in. 

i ran into eze (aka emily) at banana republic last night - its such a small 
town! 

hey, what do you do at cnrl anyway?

   Good morning Cooper! 
   I've been at work for almost an hour and the synapses are still refusing 
   to jump.  So, a short e-mail break is needed. 
   No, I didn't wind up going to see Black Hawk Down.  My parents are in 
   town from Kuwait so I've been spending time with them.  They've gone 
   soft since going over to Kuwait.  I don't thing I've ever seen two 
   colder people in my life. 
   Of COURSE I know Ian Cooke.  I hear he sits right by you at work. 
   You'll have to tell him I say hi. 
   I don't think this weekend is going to be a very exciting one on my 
   part.  My dad's leaving on Sunday so I'll be doing the family thing most 
   of the time.  Emmy said they're thinking of going to Bass Brothers 
   tomorrow and I think I'll try to go for a couple.  You coming? 
   Anyway, I should probably think about working.  Talk to you soon. 
   Jill
