eze:

its going well, thanks for asking - work is good - i'm getting excited to start trading again and i'm actually doing some real work!  feels good.  and i'm having fun with the whole exercise thing - i hope it sticks.  how are things with you - i know you are super busy, but it must be good to finally be starting a career?  

rockne is a special treat.  at least he isn't hairy.  i've found yoga to be a good antidote to modern life.  

i'm not excited to move at all, but i am looking forward to living in a new spot.  change is good.  i probly won't need your help moving, but i am planning on lifting some of those shelves from ikea, so i'll be sure to give you a ring for the install.  

great to see you last night at banana.  i can't wait to wear my blue pants, but it seems like they should follow the white pants rule, so i don't think i'll break them out until labor day.  definitely a good purchase, since i'll probably wear them twice (total).  

hope to see you tonight.

hey Cooper, 
How's it going?  
I just had coffee with Jill....so early!! 
Let me tell you,  you missed quite the yoga class last night.  Rockne was in the class,  about 1 meter to my right  (which meant that I was facing him for the most of the class).  He took it upon himself to take his shirt off.  It was quite a treat!  I am still trying to block that sight out of my mind.  The instructor was good.  I've never seen her before,  but she was very mellow.  I was so relaxed after the class,  it was just what I needed. I have been super busy and kind of stressed out lately,  so this was just what I needed.  I would like to go to core again.  I would like to take Yanny there.  Speaking of Yanny,  I don't have her e-mail,  but you should call her.  I know that she would love to hear from you (686-8815).
Jai told me you guys went to earls bankers hall,  and that the service wasn't nearly as good (okay,  I added the last part!!).  You guys should come to Tin Palace (remember 251??,  or has it been too long?).  I'm sure all the lounge girls would love to see you.  It would be a good opportunity to catch up on all the latest (and greatest) Earls gossip.
Are you excited to move this weekend?  If you need any help just let me know.  Afterall,  I have quite a talent for assembling furniture (especially shelves)!  Anytime after 2am,  when I'm done working at Earls will work for me!!
Have a super day.  Friday is almost here.......... 
Emily  
 
eze-  i got your message and i might be up for yoga tonight.  i went to 
core last night and it was nice and mellow.  do you have any idea who 
teaches the 7:30 class?  i went a while back and it this hyper-active guy 
taught the class and it wasn't so good - adding that to the rockne risk 
makes it a dangerious proposition. 
do you happen to have janice's email address?  jai and i haven't been to 
earls in a long time and i was wondering how she was doing.  if you see her 
when you're working, tell her i said hi.
