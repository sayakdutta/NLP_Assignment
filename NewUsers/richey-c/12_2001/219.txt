definitely!  what more could you ask for?  

 

This is the response.  What do you think?

Glad you could come. Im sure we will have another soon! I really love

having friends over on that scale. We usually have a few in the summer.

You'll have to meet Andrea and I for a beer at Ceili's some Friday night- we

seem to be having as few too many these days.
