yah, it's amazing how quickly christmas sneaks up on me.  

i'm hoping i won't have to come into work next week and feeling
very good about leaving work for awhile.  almost like being an 
undergrad at the end of a semester.

so, i'm flying out on wednesday and wondering if you'd like to get
together before i go?  i'm more or less free from sunday until i go.  
coffee sometime?  dinner?

Cooper:

Hope that your last day of work (prior to the holiday) is going
smoothly.  Only 11 more days till Christmas!

Nicki.
