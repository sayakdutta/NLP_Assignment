how about mon eve then?  i'm not sure how much time you have - sounds like you still have work to do before going home, but I'm up for anything - dinner or drinks/coffee later on?  or maybe something more seasonal - i don't know if you still have any shopping left, but I always leave it to the last minute and do a horrible job.  
 
i'm running around today but i'll try phoning tonight to see what you think.
