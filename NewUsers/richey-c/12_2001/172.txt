IT never got the box up


 

If you're part of the CalData_GasFund NT group, you will have full access to Alberta Gas.

As for AlbertaPower, you have full access to the dev database, and the same access as Colin has for the Prod database.

For getting server access on OLAP, you'll have to talk to Greg, I believe.

That reminds me, how did your test of SQL Server 2000 OLAP go?

Chris,


I need to get whatever access Greg and Colin had to AlbertaPower and AlbertaGas databases on dev and prod.

I may already have it, but I'm not sure, especially about the AlbertaGas database.  

basically, their accounts have been cleared from the network and I need to run things under my own account, 
rather than theirs.  

Also, on dev db, I need to admin rights as Colin had these to do some OLAP stuff.  I'm guessing you are not the
person to talk to about this?
