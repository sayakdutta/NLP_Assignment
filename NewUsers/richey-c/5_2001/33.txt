I've made the appropriate change in the AlbertaPower database, but it won't 
be automatically pushed to PETE since the pool doesn't change the data they 
have on the web (they just send out the letter.)  i.e., you may have to pull it in by hand.






Cooper/Willie, can you arrange to re-scrape the Pool Price for the Pool's web site.
Rob/Karim, can you discuss with John P to ensure that this change is picked up in his DPR.

Everyone else - FYI

Thanks

Mark
