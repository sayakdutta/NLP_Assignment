Lisa,

I will send a check today, but I'm in Canada and it may take a few days to get down there - can 
you reserve a spot for me contigent upon getting a check this week?  I've tried (unsuccessfully) 
to reserve a spot on this retreat for the last two years!  

thanks!

Hi Cooper,
Spaces are going fast but if you get a check in soon, you can reserve a
spot!
Send $500 deposit to Piedmont Yoga Studio, P.O. Box 11458, Oakland, CA  94611.
Do you have a brochure to fill out a registration form?  If not, just make
sure  I have your address and phone number.  I will send you a brochure later!
Hope you come along!
Lisa
