thanks Kathy, that would be great.  





I will have an extra fleece size Large, color Black in about a week.  When it gets hee I will mail it to you.

 

Hi Kathy,

I was wondering if I could order an Enron Fleece through you.  They don't have them up here in Calgary
and I was hoping to pick one up when I was down in Portland last week, but it seems like you were mostly
stocked up for summer gear (no fleece).

Would it be possible to do this?

thanks,
Cooper
