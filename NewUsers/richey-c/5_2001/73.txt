I sent the check to reserve a spot - it may take a while to get there from Canada, so 
please keep me in mind!

	thanks,

Hi Cooper,
Spaces are going fast but if you get a check in soon, you can reserve a
spot!
Send $500 deposit to Piedmont Yoga Studio, P.O. Box 11458, Oakland, CA  94611.
Do you have a brochure to fill out a registration form?  If not, just make
sure  I have your address and phone number.  I will send you a brochure later!
Hope you come along!
Lisa
