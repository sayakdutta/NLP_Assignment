Cooper,

There is a great Indian buffet a couple blocks from here.
I suggest that we go there for lunch.

Do you want to see the new offcies before or after lunch?
We can always decide in the morning depending upon how the 
day is going.

How was the weekend?

I was in Canmore and the weather was great!
The climbing was a bit shakey...

Craig
