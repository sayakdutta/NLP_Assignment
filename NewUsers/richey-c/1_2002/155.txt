Thanks Cheryl.

 

A cheque was mailed to them yesterday

 

Cheryl,

Nancy Taylor at Cognicase has asked me to check into payments for 2 IT Contractors.  I have the invoices and understand that you have them as well.  It's about 60 grand C$.  Are there any issues surrounding paying them?  

thanks,
Cooper
