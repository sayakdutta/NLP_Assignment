don't worry i'm certainly not blaming you for any of this. i have a short fuse when it comes to Houston IT.  

 



Okay.  Sorry for all the hassles!!  Seems like we get jerked from pillar to post complements Houston.  Just talk to Steiner if you want to hear frustration!!
 
Anyway, if we can do anything to help, just let me know.  We're all an the same team here!!

looks good.  i'm working some stuff now that is writing to the z:\ drive for publishing on the web -- i will have it write to i: and set it up so it will be easy to change from now going forward.  should be able to tell if it works from that.  i think your idea was a good one.  




Cooper,
 
Have a look.
 
How should we test this?
 
 
Thanks
