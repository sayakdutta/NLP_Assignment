oops, i just sent you a note w/o reading this one.  i might stop by ceilis for a bit.  

 


Finally...it's Friday! 
This week has flown by..the first week at work and I'm still here! (that's an accomplishment in itself) 
I just wanted to remind you that we (Jaimie and I and a few others) will be going to Ceilis around 5pm for a drink.  I was thinking about going to Janice's get together at the Auburn around 9 or 10.  I want to go home and chill out and change before I go to Yanny's...but I guess it depends on what happens at ceilis!
I hope work is going well and that your feeling better!

i'm glad you made it to yoga last night.  how did you think the space 
compares to YIM?  don't worry, you won't hurt my feelings...  they're very 
different and i'm always surprised when people prefer something like YIM, 
but yoga tastes vary widely.  i thought last night's class was excellent 
and i'm glad we all got to go.  i'm not sure why jai goes to yoga - i've 
been to a few classes with him and it's always the same deep frustration 
with poses, but ... 
yah, the jump thru to seated is fun, eh?  last night i was playing around 
with it following her directions and i realized how terrible it is to not 
be able to jump thru smoothly.  once you do it once you can do it forever. 
also fun is to do the reverse - i think the mechanics are easier on the 
reverse and then you'll be able to do full vinyasa smoothly. 

ceilis could be fun tomorrow.  let me know when you go.  this week has gone 
by quickly.  i can understand how you didn't see the scooby stickers on my 
car because it was dark, but what about the one on my forehead last night?
