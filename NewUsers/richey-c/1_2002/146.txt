sweet.  

 

$700




it looks like there are alot of places in the herald classifieds.  i need
30 days notice according to my lease.

did you do any thinking about how much you can spend on a pad?



    
            
   I don't think she checks email right now because it is a school account.
   Her phone number is 284-9898 (cell 650-1908).

   
            

   can you send eze email then?  not a disaster if you don't come.  based
   on
   the way you two got along last night, its probly better if you don't ...

       
                        
      I can decide last minute.  Set it up anyway.  Would it be a disaster
   if
      I
      decided not to come?  I love how Earls is classified as part of the
      curriculum.

      
                        

      do you want in on yoga w/ eze?  i'd like to set it up, especially
   since
      it
      may involve jamie, but not sure if you're interested in spending
      extracurricular time w/ eze
