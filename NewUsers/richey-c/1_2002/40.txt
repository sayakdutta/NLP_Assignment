it says its general admission, are there no seat assignments?  do you want to go sat or sun?

 

I'll go to Nelly.




dude.  you're over-reacting.  i think she was flustered by your voracious
flirting and pulled the chute.

i hope kryptonomicon isn't this boring in real life.

dude, are we done on nelly?

    
            


   
               That does sound nice.  I have to run now, I have  yoga.
   Have a good night!
   
               Gym  goodbye's are not necessary, I'm just a little excited....my boss
   left for  holidays just now and he's not back until Feb. 20.  It's going
   to be  nice.




   
               I am sure you are fine.  Sorry for not saying  bye.
   
               I got back to the office at about 1:45, I think.  It doesn't  take me
   too long to get through my work out.  But, thanks for saying  bye.  I
   looked up, all excited to present you with what was to be  your new
   book....and you were gone.  I just looked down at the book,  tear
   welling up in one eye, tried to keep myself together, and headed for
   the shower....dissapointed.
   
               I'm very sorry I missed it, I might have  trouble sleeping tonight and
   it will be all your fault!  We'll have  to hook up soon so you can give
   it to me.

   Are you just getting back from the gym, if so  I'm impressed.  It was so
   hot in there today I thought I was going  to pass out from heat
   exhaustion, yes, I'm  wimpy.

   Don't work too hard.

   I brought you a book, but I never got a  chance to give it to you.
   You're going to be excited.....it's  the January Peters & Co. book.  I
   figured you'd be addicted  after the reading you did on the weekend, so
   I was trying to ease your  nerves.  Your welcome.
