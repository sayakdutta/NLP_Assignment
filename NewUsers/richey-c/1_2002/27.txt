Good morning Cooper! 
I've been at work for almost an hour and the synapses are still refusing to jump.  So, a short e-mail break is needed.  
No, I didn't wind up going to see Black Hawk Down.  My parents are in town from Kuwait so I've been spending time with them.  They've gone soft since going over to Kuwait.  I don't thing I've ever seen two colder people in my life.
Of COURSE I know Ian Cooke.  I hear he sits right by you at work.  You'll have to tell him I say hi.  
I don't think this weekend is going to be a very exciting one on my part.  My dad's leaving on Sunday so I'll be doing the family thing most of the time.  Emmy said they're thinking of going to Bass Brothers tomorrow and I think I'll try to go for a couple.  You coming?
Anyway, I should probably think about working.  Talk to you soon. 
Jill 
 

did you see black hawk down?  i didn't like it that much, but i read the 
book awhile ago (really good) and its a hard subject to make a movie about. 
my brother is in the special forces, so it's scary to think he could be one 
of those guys. 

just finished playing squash with ian cooke  i'm guessing you know him too? 

i have so little to do at work these days, its hard to be motivated, but i 
suppose i could have worse things to complain about.  what movies did you 
rent? sorry if i'm nosy, but see previous sentence.

   Hi Cooper, 
   Friday night is always a good one.  This was a little better then some, 
   however, my Saturday morning made me regret the increase in the fun 
   factor. 
   My Saturday night makes your Friday look like a huge shaker.  I rented 
   movies and rarely left my couch.  I haven't had a Saturday like that in 
   months but its nice to take it easy once in a while. 
   How's Black Hawk Down?  I was going to see it tomorrow. 
   Have a good night. 
   Jill 
      
                    
     Hi Jill, 

     how was ceili's? 

     i ended up going home and taking a nap and then going to see black 
     hawk 
     down.  i think i was in bed by 10:30...  i'm sure you had more fun 
     than me. 
     overall, my w/e was fairly uneventful. you? 

     should go another time. 

     cooper 

          
                                
        Hey Cooper, 
        I wanted to thank you again for asking Emily and I to the wine 
     tasting 
        last night.  I had a great time (or as much fun as an uncultured 
     Calgary 
        hick can have) and think we should all do it again soon. 
        Also, I have been enlisted by Emmy to make sure you are coming to 
        Ceili's tonight.  She didn't get a chance to write this morning but 
        wanted to extend the invitation to you one more time.  She won't be 
     done 
        until 5 and so I think we'll head over around then. 
        Ah Ha!  Lunch time!  Hope to see you tonight and have a good rest 
     of 
        your day. 
        Jill
