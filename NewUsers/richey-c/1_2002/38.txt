did you see black hawk down?  i didn't like it that much, but i read the book awhile ago (really good) and its a hard subject to make a movie about.  my brother is in the special forces, so it's scary to think he could be one of those guys.  

just finished playing squash with ian cooke  i'm guessing you know him too?  

i have so little to do at work these days, its hard to be motivated, but i suppose i could have worse things to complain about.  what movies did you rent? sorry if i'm nosy, but see previous sentence.

Hi Cooper, 
Friday night is always a good one.  This was a little better then some, however, my Saturday morning made me regret the increase in the fun factor.
My Saturday night makes your Friday look like a huge shaker.  I rented movies and rarely left my couch.  I haven't had a Saturday like that in months but its nice to take it easy once in a while.
How's Black Hawk Down?  I was going to see it tomorrow. 
Have a good night.

Hi Jill,

i ended up going home and taking a nap and then going to see black hawk 
down.  i think i was in bed by 10:30...  i'm sure you had more fun than me. 
overall, my w/e was fairly uneventful. you? 

should go another time.

   Hey Cooper, 
   I wanted to thank you again for asking Emily and I to the wine tasting 
   last night.  I had a great time (or as much fun as an uncultured Calgary 
   hick can have) and think we should all do it again soon. 
   Also, I have been enlisted by Emmy to make sure you are coming to 
   Ceili's tonight.  She didn't get a chance to write this morning but 
   wanted to extend the invitation to you one more time.  She won't be done 
   until 5 and so I think we'll head over around then. 
   Ah Ha!  Lunch time!  Hope to see you tonight and have a good rest of 
   your day.
