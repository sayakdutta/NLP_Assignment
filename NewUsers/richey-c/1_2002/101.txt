glad to hear you are finally putting in an honest day's work!  let me know if you're planning on going to yoga tomorrow (wed).  i did like tuesdays with morrie, do you want me to pass it on to jai or give it back to you?  are you still planning your wine event on saturday?  i want to come, but i think jai is going to a hockey game for work that night.  hopefully i see you tomorrow night at yoga.
