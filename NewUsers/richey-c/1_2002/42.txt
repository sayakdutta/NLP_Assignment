dude.  you're over-reacting.  i think she was flustered by your voracious flirting and pulled the chute.    

i hope kryptonomicon isn't this boring in real life.  

dude, are we done on nelly?  

 


 

That does sound nice.  I have to run now, I have  yoga.
Have a good night!

Gym  goodbye's are not necessary, I'm just a little excited....my boss left for  holidays just now and he's not back until Feb. 20.  It's going to be  nice.
 
 
 
 

I am sure you are fine.  Sorry for not saying  bye.

I got back to the office at about 1:45, I think.  It doesn't  take me too long to get through my work out.  But, thanks for saying  bye.  I looked up, all excited to present you with what was to be  your new book....and you were gone.  I just looked down at the book,  tear welling up in one eye, tried to keep myself together, and headed for  the shower....dissapointed.

I'm very sorry I missed it, I might have  trouble sleeping tonight and it will be all your fault!  We'll have  to hook up soon so you can give it to me.  
 
Are you just getting back from the gym, if so  I'm impressed.  It was so hot in there today I thought I was going  to pass out from heat exhaustion, yes, I'm  wimpy.  
 
Don't work too hard.
 

CATHY! 
I brought you a book, but I never got a  chance to give it to you.  You're going to be excited.....it's  the January Peters & Co. book.  I figured you'd be addicted  after the reading you did on the weekend, so I was trying to ease your  nerves.  Your welcome.
