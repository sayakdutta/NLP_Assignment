hi emily,

i left fairly quickly on friday night - sorry i didn't say goodbye - i was in a strange mood, maybe being sick and drunk?  anyway, i feel like i should have socialized more there and regret not talking to janice more, but it was great to see earls people outside of earls amongst friends.  

why don't we go to YIM instead of the Space?  i'm happy to go to yoga with other people instead of alone and i can go to any yoga class and enjoy myself, although rockne gets on my nerves if i let him.  i think janice wants to come too?  

congratulations on passing all of your courses.  i found graduating to be somewhat anti-climactic - i wish you had a ceremony to go to, but maybe things are different in canada.  

i finished reading tuesdays with morrie - great book - it's good to be reminded of certain things in life.  

i did get your call last night but deleted your home number.  i called your cell, but no one answered and there was no voice mail for some reason.  can you send on your home number?   

	- c -
