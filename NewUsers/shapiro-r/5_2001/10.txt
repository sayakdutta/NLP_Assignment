I heard more about Viviana before I left London last week and apparently her 
concern she was'nt being properly guided or mentored- despite her apparent 
current performance and your  lack of time, I think we do owe her an action 
plan at mid-year at the latest and a decent opportunity to redeem herself. 
Please let me know how I can be of assistance. Thanks.
