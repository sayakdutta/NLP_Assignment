Dutch,

Attached is a file with volumes for the EEX VPP.  Remember, we will simply do an incremental VPP with additional volumes (column C), but our "pitch" to EEX is to tell them how much they would save by doing the incremental with us and not another company.  So, we want you to quote up the unwind of the existing VPP (offer in column B) as well as the Bid for the entire volume (column A).

Please provide the quote based upon where you set tonight's curve.

Per my model ...

A: Total Volume - Adjustment is -.1259
B: Existing Volume - Adjustment is -.0548
C: Incremental Volume - Adjustment is -.0475

Thanks!

Eric
