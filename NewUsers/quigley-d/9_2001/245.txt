Kay,

 

Thanks for your message - don't worry - according to the leukemia info, jackie will be in and out of the hospital many times over the next two years - most of the time it will be routine trips for chemo (4 to 8 hour visits) and getting rid of infections (up to 1 week visits) - if it ever looks serious, i'll let you know. Thanks for thinking about us and especially my little Jack.

 

Robert
