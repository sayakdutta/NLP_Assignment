no to the snake


 


Chris  don't do it!!! KEEP THE ALGEBRAIC MEAN SEQUENCED DRAFT ORDER.   

As  the creator of the algebraic mean sequenced draft order that was built to  eliminate the inherent advantage that the #1 & #14 teams had by getting  back to back picks every other round, I think the time for mathematical  preciseness has passed.  I'm all for going to a simplified traditional  snake system.  Frankly, at this point I think there are as many  disadvantages to being 1 or 14 (or 2 - 13) as advantages that it all works  itself out.  Hell, if it makes preparing for the draft any easier (or  administering the league), I'm for it!
 
PS -  I'm for keeping TE's too!

The following is the list of franchise players  that have been kept:
 
Grant Johnson - Eddie George
Jeff Smith - Peyton Manning
Michael Deluke - Marshall Faulk
Michael Currie - Edgerrian James
Jeff Ullrich - Kurt Warner
 
I know this was brought up last year and we  kind of decided much of nothing...but does anyone object to going to a snake  system for the draft.  1-14, 14-1 for the whole draft?  We will  still have a supplemental round for those that do not keep franchise  players.  Then the non-franchise teams will pick in opposite order of  the supplemental round for round one...thus if you pick first in the  supplemental round, you will pick last (for those that did not keep  franchise players) in the first round.  Then, the teams that kept  franchise players will be randomly selected to pick at the end of the first  round.  After the first round, the draft will snake back the other way  with the last pick in the first round getting the first pick in the second  round and the draft will continue in this snake order until the end of the  draft.  Let me know what you think or if you are confused.
 
See everyone at the draft!!!
