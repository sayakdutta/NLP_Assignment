no change on the numbers i gave you the last time
the settlement last night was about 0.025 cents to low for that term 
the settle was 3.196

 

This is the same deal Russell has been pricing up with you.  It is a big VPP with Hilcorp and Lehman is recommending they proceed with Enron and we plan on meeting on Monday.

So, can I get a refresh BID on the following....

Thanks!

Eric
