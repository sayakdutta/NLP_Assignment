Sorry to hear that Richard , Will send prayers now and gifts later

Hopefully everyone got their invitation to her party and now you can all
throw them away.  If you were coming to the party it has been cancelled b/c
Michaela is very sick.  Carrie took off today to take her to the doctor with
my mom and I'm not sure how she will be feeling by this weekend.  So we
think the best thing to do is just cancel and she just wont get any cake.
We are a little worried about her so say a prayer and hopefully all will be
okay.

Richard
