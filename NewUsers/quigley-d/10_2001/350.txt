i shared with you the fact that people on this floor see me as a likeable person and that the give me a hard 
time when it cames to some woman on the floor , the fact that they will stop by and chat

Mo is a friend of mine that nothing has nor will ever go any farther than that , just a friendship

I did tell you about this and i am sry that you did not remember , you only compound this by cancelling dinner
with RK and Heather & i do not know how these things get so turned around between us






 

all you are doing right now is promoting my illwill towards
certain things I do not like about you know what
I would have been just fine if it had not been so pronounced
so now I feel that you are specifically hiding something
which is really uncool
