One of the questions posed in Don?t Sweat the Small Stuff is, ?Will this
matter a year fromnow?? Some things will, of course. But so many
others--perhaps most things---won?t. There is something very comforting in
knowing this. When the computer crashes, the keys are misplaced, the house
is a mess or the call isn?t returned, it is annoying, but it?s not the end
the world.
