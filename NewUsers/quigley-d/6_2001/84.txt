Hey Lee,

I was checking my msg for the claims adjuster and realized you left a msg , anytime you want to get a hold of me
just email me or stento me at 5952 , I never know when I have a msg on these phones

the market was weak this morning mainly due to power and then cash came in strong around 9:45 then that was followed by
short covering and stop losses , during this the front was strong and the back was weak and then the back picked up support
when the front got over 4.30 and the back pushed it up from there

All of this in front of aga

what a day
