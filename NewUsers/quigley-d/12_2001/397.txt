Hey Bro,

My wife worked here also and has been let go.
I work for the Natural Gas Trading group that they are trying to sell.
Should know by the end of the week about my job.
I was just talking to Kevin Crawford about you 2 weeks ago when we were in Vegas. 
Good to know that you are still out there.
How are you doing these days ?

I thought about you when I heard about Enron.  Were you affected? Give me a
call and we can meet up sometime.
