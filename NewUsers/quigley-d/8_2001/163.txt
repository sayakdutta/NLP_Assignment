kay i told you last week that i did not want to go
if you perfer to go alone than this is not a problem
if you would like tio share with me why you are on edge
i am happy to listen but lets not argue about other things
i am sorry if i did not make myself more clear i will in the future

I realize that to decline an invite is no big deal to you
and actually I prefer to go alone tonight anyway
but could you please be more considerate in your approach
and not wait until the last minute to give me your decision
thank you
