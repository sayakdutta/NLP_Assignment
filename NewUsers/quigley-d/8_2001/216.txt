 Kevin,

There have been several things change as of late in my life.
One ,  we are not buying a townhouse anymore, we still have to sell our lot.
Kay is going to stay at a townhouse near downtown and as of today i am looking for an apartment.
I came to the realization that I got way off track , as I usually do , with the plan of both of us
getting a place on our own for six months and going from there. I can not tell you how grateful I 
have been for the support both you and Nancy have given me during this time in my life.
I know i have not been at your house as of late and that is due to being off track of the plan.
Is it ok for me to be at your house on and off for the next couple of weeks as i get an apartment set up ?
I will be working on renting a place that starts the 1st of the month.

Let me know
