i saw that too and i really appriciate the though on the unlimited golf but i really think i can just pay green fees and not spend
the money for "the package" b/c Friday i will not be able to play and i will only play twice i want you to be able to
enjoy the spas also




 

here is a link to a golf package in Four Seasons Scottsdale- I ran airfare on Expedia and it's not too bad $220 per person roundtrip
