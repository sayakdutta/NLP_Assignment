Dutch,

Can you please tell me the conversion of nat gas price per mmbtu to price per gallon or bbl.  For example, if nat gas is 4.891/mmbtu for May, how does it convert to $/gal or bbl?

Thanks for your help.  I appreciate your time.

We do not know what the conversion is.  I can check w/Errol first thing in the morning if that is o.k.?
Sorry,
Sherry
