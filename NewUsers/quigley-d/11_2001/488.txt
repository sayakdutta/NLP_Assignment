Gerri,
 
Do you know who pays the brokers commissions each month ?
I am trying to gather the per transaction costs they we pay on the exchange.
 
Dutch




Good Morning!
 
We have excess of $4,498,358.00 with EDF Man.  I called and talked with Paul this morning and he said that he could not confirm the wire for today as of yet.  
 
I'll let you know asap.
 
Thanks!
