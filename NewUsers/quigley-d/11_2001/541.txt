I believe the dog is in the back of the KMB express truck along with all the flees I picked up from Pierre's circus

Once again, someone thought they could hang with the big DOG and ended up
with Canine Teeth marks on his ass.  Sorry Richard!  Marshall Faulk just
wasn't enough.  Don't take it personnal it's just the way it is.  Who dare
try to come to my yard next?

Fear the DOG!

Is anyone on the Red Division ever going to take control?

BTW Mark - You got knocked the f**k out!!
