okay - here's what i know -- we are trying to hire some of the best

people out there at whatever they may do -- one position that we are

looking at is kinda what you are already doing -- our nymex trader is

bob shiring -- take that however you wish -- but that's who you  would

be working directly with so that's who you would need to talk to.  i

know this position is in the budget for this year but i'm not sure what



can tell him that you got his name from me and then i'm sure he'll

approach me about it -- that is, of course, if you are interested and to

the extent that you do not have any contractual issues in talking to us.









Hey Tori,

First of all Congrats on the new job.

Thanks for telling Susan and thinking about me.

So tell me a little about what the opportunity is all about.

If there another person that I should talk to just email me

the Name and number and I can talk to them.
