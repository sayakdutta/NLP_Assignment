Hi Mike,
 
How is everything?
 
I know That you tried getting back to me a couple of weeks ago after I sent you the earlier email, and we just keep missing each other!
 
Things move fast over here, the race season is going OK and I've managed not to kill myself yet! We have had an offer of some sponsorship in the states to race in the Speedvision Touring Car championship, so far we've got about 30% of the $600,000 that we need. I am trying to get hold of the names of some companies in th US who sell to end users (Joe Public) and perhaps are not normally associated with racing, big retailers, that sort of thing. I was wondering if you had any idea's, all I need is about six or seven company names, I can research the rest over the internet and send them some proposals via email. If you have two minutes to email them to me that would be great.
 
Cheers
 
John

Hi Mike,
 
Well, I did it, got the deal to do BTCC Touring Cars, it has a similar profile here in the UK to Nascar, but is actually very closely related to The Speedvision Touring Car Championship in the US.
 
Here's me and my team-mate racing;

We are having a very good year, but would like to do it in the US in 2002, can you give me a call on either 01625 520997 or my cell phone which is 07710 769289, I'd like to pick your brains on a couple of things. Can you believe people actually line up to get my autograph!!!! how weird is that?! Hope the family are well and look forward to talking to you soon.
 
John B&Q (it's a long story...but I changed my name AGAIN to match the sponsors name, so that when the commentary team on the TV talk about me....they advertise the sponsors brand!)
