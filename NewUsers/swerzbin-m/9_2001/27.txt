Tom thanks for getting back to me ... its great to have more alumni friends in the company.....  give me a call if you have any questions or interest in West Power.  Regards, Mike.

 

Hi, Mike,

I guess it must be somebody else with the same name. I just graduated (Dec'00), and in 1986 I was in London doing my undergraduate studies...

Sorry to disappoint you. Regards,

(Another) Tom Barkley
