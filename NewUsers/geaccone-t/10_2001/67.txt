Rod and Tracy:

Would you be able to meet with Jerry before the Budget Meeting with Mr. Horton?  Jerry said that a breakfast meeting would work for him.  Please let me know at your earliest convenience.  FYI, Jerry will be staying at the Doubletree Hotel the night before (Oct. 11).

Thank you, both.
