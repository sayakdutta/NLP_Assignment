I think you are right.  I will change the number.  Thanks

 

Tracy-

I will see if we have any updates, although I doubt we would change the number from last we met.  I believe the presentation of the numbers has caused some confusion.  We are forecasting a (5.2) recurring loss, plus a (13.8) loss on Marlin, totaling (19.0) loss.  I think you added the 19 and the 5.2 to get to the 24.2 you have listed below.  The correct total is (19.0).  







Rod and I are meeting with Stan Monday afternoon, October 22, to talk about the 4th Quarter.  I have listed below the latest IBIT impact to Enron for the 4th Quarter that I have.  Please let me know if there are any changes and provide any variance explanations if necessary.  

PGG  $28.0
EREC $53.2
Azurix  ($24.2) including Marlin
Clean fuels ($21.1)
EGAS  ($14.1)
EEOS ($26.6)

Thanks

Tracy
