I have some errands I need to run at lunch.  I can pick my things up then.  About Las Vegas,  I never received a confirm on Danny Gains last week.  I am not sure what happened, however, I called the Mirage directly and he is sold out that weekend.  Anything else you would like to see?  What about for dinner, any place special you would like to go? 

 

If you don't mind that would help out. Does that mean you would stay at my house tonight? Do you need to go home and get your things? I can't wait to see you again.

 

I can't wait to see you tonight.  If you have alot of things to do at home, I don't mind driving to your house after Jackie's conference.   I have an Azurix 2002 Plan review from 2:30-4:30, so I will not be at your staff meeting.  I should be around until then.

Love you,
