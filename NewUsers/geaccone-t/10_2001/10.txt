Tracy,

Hoang will not be available the week of 10/29.  Please let me know you have
any concerns about this.  

I've also talked to Joe about using Riaz to assist with the remaining work
for Corporate and based on our discussion both Riaz and Dennis are reserved
for Enron for the remainder of the year.  Please let me know how you want to
utilize Riaz for ETS for the remainder of the year.  

Thanks.
