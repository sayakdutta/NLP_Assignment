I believe in 2001 it was $5.5.  Clean Fuels and HPL received some in 2001 and not any in 2002.

 

Our budget for SAP was $700,000 for 2001.  Has it really gone up that much ($6,000,000 divided by four is $1,500,000)?

The SAP costs were included in the ETS overhead in Adaytum.  We have taken that out and added to each pipes Corporate Direct.  The cost of $6.0 million will be divided equally amongst the four pipes.  Mary will change all but NBP.  Cheryl please make change for NBP.  This is per Rod's instructions.  When we get the user list we will revise.


Thanks
