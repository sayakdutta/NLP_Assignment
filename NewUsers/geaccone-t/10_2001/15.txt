When is Stan available?  Probably will take no more than 2 hours.




 

Yes we do.  We were thinking the week of the 15th.  Can you find us a time?






Rod mentioned to me last week that we would only review Wessex on Wednesday.  Do we need to schedule something for the rest of Azurix?

Thanks

Tracy
