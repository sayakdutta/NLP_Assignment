Of course, shortly after my previous email, there were a few changes in the allocations, so please refer to the file attached here.  The changes were to Cost Centers:

100034 - Health Center
100141 - Body Shop
100142 - Employee Recreation

The changes were, for the most part, very minor.

Thanks,
Steve
