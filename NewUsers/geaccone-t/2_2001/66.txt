I was hoping to find out the team colors before odering practice shirts.  Do we know what they are?










What a great group of kids! All 11 kids showed and gave a great effort. 

3 items to address: 

      1. Practice each Saturday has now been changed to 9am not 9:30. Same  
Location. Please show this Saturday at 9 so that we can start on time. 

      2. Please fill out and bring your child's medical release this  
Saturday if you haven't already. 
       
      3. Please contact Tracy (Team Mom) about ordering a practice jersey if  
she doesn't contact you first. 

P.S. I know Tracy is planning a fun team get together for the parents and  
kids soon so if anyone has suggestions, now is the time! 

       Thanks everyone, Cliff Lee Roberts
