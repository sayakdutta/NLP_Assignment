Can you help me out ?  I thought you were going to process and close it out.  Let me know.
                                                                                                                        Stay in touch,

Bob,

I have checked with Sandy Sheffield in credit and she says that Enron Liquid Services has not yet paid that $16,000.00.  Could you please give Tracy Geaccone a call.  We would like to get that off the books.  Thanks for all your help.

Karen
