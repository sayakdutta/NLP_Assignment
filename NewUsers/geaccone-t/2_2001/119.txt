Fire authorities in California found a corpse in a burned out section of
forest while assessing the damage done by a forest fire. The deceased male
was dressed in a full wet suit, complete with SCUBA tanks on his back,
flippers, and face mask.

A post-mortem revealed that the person died not from burns, but from massive
internal injuries. Dental records provided a positive identification.
Investigators then set about to determine how a fully clad diver ended up in
the middle of a forest fire.

It was revealed that, on the day of the fire, the person went for a diving
trip off the coast some 20 miles away from the forest. The firefighters,
seeking to control the fire as quickly as possible, called
in a fleet of helicopters with very large dip buckets. Water was dipped from
the ocean then flown to the forest fire and emptied.

You guessed it. One minute our diver was making like Flipper in the Pacific,
the next he was doing the breast stroke in a fire dip bucket 300 feet in the
air. Apparently he extinguished exactly 5'-10" of the
fire. Some days it just doesn't pay to get out of bed!

STILL THINK YOU ARE HAVING A BAD DAY?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A man was working on his motorcycle on his patio and his wife was in the
kitchen. The man was racing the engine on the motorcycle when it
accidentally slipped into gear. The man, still holding on to the handle
bars, was dragged through the glass patio doors and along with the
motorcycle dumped onto the floor inside the house.

The wife, hearing the crash, ran into the dining room and found her husband
laying on the floor, cut and bleeding, the motorcycle laying next to him and
the shattered patio door. The wife ran to the phone and summoned an
ambulance. Because they lived on a fairly large hill, the wife went down the
several flights of stairs to the street to escort the paramedics to her
husband.

After the ambulance arrived and transported the man to the hospital, the
wife righted the motorcycle and pushed it outside. Seeing that gas was
spilled on the floor, the wife got some paper towels, blotted up the
gasoline, and threw the towels in the toilet.

The husband was treated and released to come home. Upon arriving at home, he
looked at the shattered patio door and the damage done to his motorcycle. He
became despondent, went to the bathroom, sat down on the toilet and smoked a
cigarette. After finishing the cigarette, he flipped it between his legs
into the toilet bowl while still seated.

The wife, who was in the kitchen, heard the loud explosion and her husband
screaming. She ran into the bathroom and found her husband lying on the
floor. His trousers had been blown away and he was suffering burns on the
buttocks, the back of his legs and his groin. The wife again ran to the
phone to call the ambulance.

The very same paramedic crew was dispatched and the wife met them at the
street. The paramedics
loaded the husband on the stretcher and began carrying him to the street.
While they were going down the stairs to the street accompanied by the wife,
one of the paramedics asked the wife how the husband had burned himself.

 She told them and the paramedics started laughing so hard, one of them
slipped and tipped the stretcher, dumping the husband out. He fell down the
remaining stairs and broke his arm.
