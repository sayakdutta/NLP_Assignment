Attached is an explanation of the revised capital charge that will be used for 2001.  It is substanially different from the methodology used in prior years and will be applied only on at the business unit level.

The 2001 Plan will be restated to include the revised capital charge.  The restated plan format file will be due on February 24.  We will send a template for calculating the plan capital charge next week.

The actual capital charge for January will be booked in February business.

If you have any questions, please let me know.
