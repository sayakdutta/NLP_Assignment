Rod has purchased two performances at the Houston Livestock Show & Rodeo in the Columbia Suites.  He would like to extend this offer to you and
employees in your group.

I will need a reply by Thursday, February 8, 2001.  When you reply please specify what performance you are interested in.  Once all replies are in we will be having a drawing.

FYI - Due to construction, there will be no parking at Reliant Park.



Thank You,
