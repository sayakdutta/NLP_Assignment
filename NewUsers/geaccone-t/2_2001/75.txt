I need to make a clarification.  Those Corporate and ETS charges which are headcount driven should be the only ones to stop being charged to Co. 0584 and instead go to 0012.  The non-headcount driven charges should continue to be charged to Co. 0584.  On these we can continue to earn a management fee.  Tracy, perhaps we need a sit down and we can identifiy those Corp./ETS charges that we determined are headcount driven.

Barney estimates that any participation of GCO in HPL Operations will end perhaps in June 2001.
