I still need to understand why we are at the 4.45% and what we can do in the future if anything to control it.   Can someone help me with this?

Thanks

I have attached a summary and schedules which indicate the following.

EPPI owes Oneok/GPM $339,158.69
Oneok owes NNG	$  92,774.99
Net amount due is	$246,383.70  Per Dan Fancler

Oneok invoices total $301,383.96.  Oneok has not recognized that some months they paid under the 4.45% and owe NNG.
 << File: GPM 101021  101073 Recalculation.xls >> Oneok is pushing hard for the money, so I am turning over the resolution of the differences to NNG marketing and the resolution of the cash payment to Tracy Geaccone and/or Jennifer Lev.
