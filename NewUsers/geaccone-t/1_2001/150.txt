As of December 31, 2000 I have  69  hours of vacation remaining. This exceeds the normal 40 hours allowed to be carried over due to:

- SAP implementation- was responsible for Cost center master data update and upload- May to July 2000
- EOTT Operations- Cost Center set up and 2001 Plan consolidation and reconciliation.

Thanks
