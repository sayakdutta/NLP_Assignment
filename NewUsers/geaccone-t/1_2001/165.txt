I will let you know when I have the company set up in SAP (the accounting system).  You can still do business, I just can't record any transactions.  This should only take one week.

Lillian, as I mentioned on the phone today, on the form I sent you I erroneously designated Mavrix as a subsidiary of Transwestern Pipeline Company.   Mavrix should actually be a subsidiary of Enron Transportation Services.  Mavrix has not yet done any business as a new entity.  Please make the necessary corrections as soon as possible, and let me know if you need further information.

Thank you!
