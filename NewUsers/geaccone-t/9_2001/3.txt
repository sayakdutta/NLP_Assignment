One of my favorites!  Just tell me when and where.

 

I have been thinking I want to do exactly what we did on Saturday (same way, same everything). I really liked it.

 

I miss you, too.  What exactly have you been thinking?  Kim set lunch up for Palu.  I thought that was really nice.  I guess that means we will have to behave ourselves. I love you.

Hey beautiful. I have been thinking about you all morning (and night). Can't wait to see you. I hear we are going to lunch tomorrow. Talk to you soon. Love you.
