Hey Peter, Could you pass this on to the proper person. For the past week or
so, we've been getting some very low prices from Enron in the San Juan
Basin. The non-Bondad and Bondad price have been the same, and non-Bondad
been very much below the rest of the market especially considering the
volume reported. Today, I understand you posted a 4.145 for your online
trading average. You reported 4.07 for 600,000 to us. What gives? Thanks. T
