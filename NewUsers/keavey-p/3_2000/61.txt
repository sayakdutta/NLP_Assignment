Dale,

To follow up on our conversation, our only problem is in the short 
description. We would like to make in simpler. 

Possibly  reading  " Gas Daily Index" as the product type

Also it seems that the long description in product manager  that we approve 
while  copying  a product does not match the long description after the 
product is created ???
