Mark --

Can you follow up with Mark Taylor to make sure he has everything he needs 
from us to help with the NDAs?  I am putting together a list of the 
appropriate contact people at each company.  We will start having meetings 
with these folks as soon as we have good NDAs.  The most immediate needs are 
Oracle, SAP, IBM, and Sun.  Thanks.

Hello Mark --

Here is the initial list of companies for which we will likely need new 
NDAs.  I believe that at least one Enron company has an NDA in place with 
each of these companies already.  

Ariba, Inc.
Commerce One, Inc.
EDS Corporation
IBM Corporation
i2 Technologies, Inc.
Microsoft Corporation
Oracle Corporation
PriceWaterhouseCoopers
SAP Corporation
Sun Microsystems, Inc.
TIBCO Inc.

Thanks.
