Please respond to "Wholesale Electric Contract Standardization Group" 




Please be advised that the meeting in June for the entire Standard Contract 
Group is now confirmed to take place on Tuesday, June 8th, from 9:30 a.m. * 
3:30 a.m. in EEI's offices at 701 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 
20004.  A revised contract and agenda will be forthcoming.

If you plan to attend this meeting, please inform Kathy Seaman at 
202/508-5757 or respond to this message by using your e-mail program's 
"ReplyTo" function.  If you have any questions or concerns, you can reach 
Kathy at 202/508-5757 or Andy Katz at 202/508-5616.

In the meantime, attached for the entire group is a Petition for Exemption 
filed with the CFTC on May 19 requesting that certain Electric Energy 
Contracts be exempted from CFTC jurisdiction under the Commodities Exchange 
Act (CEA).  The CEA contains an exemption for Energy Contracts for the 
purchase sale of oil and natural gas products which have certain 
characteristics.  The Petition asks that similarly situated Electric Energy 
Contracts be included in the exemption. For further information on the 
Petition, contact Michael S. Hindus, Cameron McKenna LLP, 415-954-8484,
