Dear Mr. Taylor:

I am putting together a conference on eCommerce:  The Law of
eBusiness, to be held in Houston, TX on May 17-18, 2001.  Hank Jones
of Fulbright & Jaworski is chairing the event, and he wanted me to invite
Enron Bandwidth's General Counsel to speak at the conference on B2B
issues.  Unfortunately, I have been unable to track this person down, so
I am wondering if you can help put me in touch with him or her.

Please give me a call or send a return email.  Thank you for your time.


Kindest Regards,
Ms. Kerry D. Mason
Program Attorney
