After discussions with the legal group, given the mandate about including the 
market opening and regulatory change conditions in all power transactions, 
whether physical or financial, it seems to be most prudent to hold off 
offering Canadian power products through the facilities of EnronOnline until 
the new year when we have more certainty around the Alberta market.

Thanks
