In case you haven't already looked at the Fee Agreement draft, here is a 
slightly revised version.  Also attached is a revised BETA.  The changes 
marked in the BETA are a combination of the commercial guy's comments and my 
revisions of those comments (hopefully marked separately).  Unfortunately I 
didn't get the changes in the Fee Agreement marked.
