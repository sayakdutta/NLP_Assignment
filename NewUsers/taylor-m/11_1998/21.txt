The alternatives are a net worth of US$1,000,000 or that all trades be 
guaranteed by an entity that meets the financial requirements.

Just a line to confirm that the capital requirements for the new trading 
company under CFTC rules will be the same as those applicable to ECTRIC- i.e. 
it must have total assets in excess of US$10,000,000.

Kind regards
