Edmund:

Rod Nelson has just informed me that Credit will not be approving Duke Energy 
Trading & Marketing as a reference entity.  I don't think it makes sense to 
review the various Duke confidentiality agreements at this point.  Please let 
me know if the situation changes.

There are a variety of CAs with U.S. Duke Energy entities.   

Mary J. Heinitz has provided me with a list of these which I'll forward to 
Mark for his consideration under the cover of a separate email.

Thanks, Edmund.

Unfortunately, it's not quite that simple.  Duke Energy Trading & Marketing 
is a marketing sub and does not prepare separate financials.  The S&P rating 
is based on an implied guaranty from Duke Energy.  Legal would also need to 
review this counterparty from the standpoint of confidentiality agreement 
violations. 

Also, as a trading counterparty, Sempra Energy Trading is not authorized for 
credit derivative trading, because the existing guaranty does not explicitly 
cover this type of transaction.  If Sempra wishes to transact out of this 
entity, we can look into amending the guaranty to cover this product.  This 
will require legal efforts and approval.

Both of  these entities have an E-rating of 3. Any issues?
