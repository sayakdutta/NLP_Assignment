I guess it depends on where you got the prices - were they from a particular 
publication?  If not, I would suggest that you go to the NYMEX website and 
check for older prices there and you can cite to that.  Let me know if that 
doesn't work.

Doug Leach said you were the expert.

I am publishing a chart using NYMEX settlement average prices by month in 
1998 and need to cite where the #s come from.  Doug said you would know.  Is 
there a data bank that has these prices or a hard copy that I can reference 
(publication, title, date, page).

Thank you very much,

ROB
