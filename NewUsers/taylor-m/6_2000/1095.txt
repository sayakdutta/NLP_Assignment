I agree with you 100%.  I hope that Mike can make it clear to John that it is 
never appropriate to criticize another department - whether Legal or anyone 
else - in such a public manner.  If he feels there is a problem that should 
be corrected, he should proceed through proper channels.  In this case, a 
direct one-on-one conversation with Andrea strikes me as the most obvious 
route and if that is not possible, not productive or just too awkward, he 
should have approached either you or Mike.  Sending out an e-mail that might 
be considered personally critical of Andrea in such a public way is clearly 
contrary to our core value of Respect.  I hope you are able to have some 
input into the review process for John and this should certainly be 
mentioned.  If you need my help in any way, please let me know.
