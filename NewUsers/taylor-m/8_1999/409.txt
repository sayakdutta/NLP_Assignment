Dear all,

As already promised to some of you, attached is a copy of the transaction
summary (very big picture) which we prepared for the purpose of distributing
among the senior lenders.  It includes a structure chart.

Please note that, also as already indicated to some of you, ECT Europe Inc.
is to play no part in the transaction.  In this respect both the attached
summary/chart and the documentation are out of date.
Instead, Enron Capital and Trade Resources Corporation will assume the role
expressed to be assumed by ECT Europe Inc.

This will need to be taken account of when preparing your opinions.

Kind regards,  Paul Coleman.
