I won't be able to attend the forum since I am travelling but do have a 
suggestion that would make TAP a bit more attractive.  When a traveller is 
placed on a "wait list" the agency should check back with the provider 
regularly and often to see if the wait can be cleared.  If you wait for the 
provider to get back to you, as appears to be TAP's policy, the chances are 
significantly reduced since the provider will almost invariably clear the 
person on the phone before anyone on the list.  Other agents have done this 
for me, I have done this for myself, and it works.
