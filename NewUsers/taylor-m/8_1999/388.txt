As discussed the table to be completed by August 4th in order for us to start 
loading the customer profiles into the system.

The following worksheet is split into two tabs for the counterparty groups 
suggested by the North America commercial versus those counterparties 
suggested by Europe commercial.  The US tab consists of the following 
information:  

Column A Fed Tax ID (needed for physical global products counterparties)
Column B Country where Headquarters is located
Column C State of Incorporation
Column D Country of Incorporation
Column E Counterparty Name
Column F Dunnes Link ID
Columns G-CU Product Types/Enron Legal Entity

The Europe Tab is set as follows:

Column A Country of Incorporation
Column B Counterparty Name
Column C Dunnes Link ID
Columns D-CR Product Types/Enron Legal Entity 



The matrix is blank assuming that all counterparties can trade all product 
types/Enron Legal Entity.  The above  responsibility groups will need to 
perform a detailed review by placing a "X" in the intersection of the 
counterparty/product types indicating that that Product Type should not be 
offered to that counterparty.

This review needs to be completed by no later than cob August 4, 1999 so that 
we can remain on our overall click trading schedule.
