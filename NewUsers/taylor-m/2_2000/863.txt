Too bad you didn't call when you got in - I wasn't able to find Mr. B until 
about 8 - we missed the first half but went anyway.  Have you guys been up to 
anything fun lately?  Did you know T has a new job?  He's at an internet 
start-up called iVita.








i've been meaning to email you.  thanks for the invite last week for the
rockets... i can't remember what we were doing that evening, i think we had

7:30ish..

thanks for thinking of us anyway.

hope all is well.
