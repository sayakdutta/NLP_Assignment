I have not received any comments.  I consider it final.  Let me know if you 
need to have it customized for any particular circumstance.  Since I don't 
know who (or for that matter what) the PCG heads are, I sugggest that if they 
need it you send them copies.

Mark,

Please let me know when you consider this letter finalised - one of us should 
send copies to the PCG heads.

Here's a draft of a termination letter.  I'd be happy to see what everyone 
thinks before we use it.  For instance, what tone are we aiming for?  If we 
want to be all legal and hard-nosed, I can throw in ETA section references, 
etc. or if we want to be softer we can emphasize other trading opportunities 
within Enron and possibly explain our reasons for the termination.

Let me know what you think.
