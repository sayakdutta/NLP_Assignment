 



Mark and Bob:

	Attached please find the revised license agreement, together with a
redline showing the changes that were made.  Specifically I added the right
of the licensee to distribute the data formats to facilitate communication
with the licensee.  And I removed bracketed questions and language.

	If you have any questions or require any further assistance, please
let me know.
