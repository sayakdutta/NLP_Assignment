While I am out next week, you can call on the following lawyers if you need assistance:

EnronOnline generally (including "enhanced limit orders") - Barbara Gray (x36832)
Private e-marketplaces - Anne Koehler (x33488)
Commodity Logic and hub issues - Mark Greenberg (x58897)

Tana Jones (x33399) may also be able to answer some questions, particularly relating to EnronOnline counterparty approvals, and is pretty good at tracking down the appropriate lawyer if you can't.
