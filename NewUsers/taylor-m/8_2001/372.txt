I have found a couple of other people who are interested in going, but tonight is Ted's last night in town before moving to Ft. Lauderdale so if you're feeling up to it maybe we could get together for a drink after the game.  Just let me know.

 

Hey Mark,
Sorry about the delayed answer.  We're in town this week and the game sounds
like fun.  My only problem is that my stomach is in knots and I'm not sure
if it'll be better this afternoon.  If you can give them away I'd say do
that, if not, can we touch base this afternoon???   By the way, do you still
have the sail boat??????

Gordon






I have tickets to the Astros game on Friday (tomorrow) eve.  Any
interest?
