We have left a message with Jeff McMahon to see if he will take commercial 
responsibility for either signing the docs, or if he is not authorized to 
sign for these companies, to give the OK to someone else in Houston to sign 
who is authorized.  In the past we have had Dana Gibbs help us out - which is 
another option.

We have been thru these issues before on other transactions, and ECT Europe 
takes responsibility as far as P&L goes.  I'm not sure it works from a tax 
standpoint though to have all these side letters floating around - because 
then it could get us in a tough spot with the tax man.  Our preferred 
approach is to get someone in Houston to stand up for London for signatory 
purposes.

Please advise if you have any comments.

Scott,

Mark Taylor wants to make sure ECT management is comfortable with assuming 
the risk of all these transactions.  Has anybody on your deal team obtained 
the proper ECT-NA support for these transactions.  If tax reasons are driving 
these deals to ECT-NA, perhaps we will need a side letter where ECT-Europe 
guarantees to ECT-NA performance on these transactions.

Let us know how you want us to proceed to get the necessary signatures by the 
end of the day.
