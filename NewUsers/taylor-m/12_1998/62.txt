Just for your background info, the other reason we use deemed ISDAs on the 
interest rate & currency deals is that the omnibus was really drafted with 
commodity deals in mind.  I'd have to go back and look at it to see if it 
would work at all for an interest rate or currency deal.  Do you think I 
should do that?  Hopefully not or at least not til after 1/1.

With respect to your request for a Deemed ISDA Confirm for the referenced 
counterparty, I checked with Yao, our paper guru, and he said there is no 
special reason or precedence for using the Deemed ISDA confirmations for the 
paper boys (unless maybe if they did a really long-dated trade).  He said we 
could go ahead and use the omnibus.  Just because we hope to sign an ISDA, 
doesn't necessarily mean we use the Deemed ISDA confirmations.  In practice, 
we tend to use the Deemed ISDA's for international counterparties, for the 
interest rate and currency desk (because a lot of their counterparties are 
banks and dealers and more familiar with the ISDA's, unlike our energy 
counterparties).

Call me with any questions...
