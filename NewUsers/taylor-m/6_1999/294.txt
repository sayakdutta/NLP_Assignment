I don't remember if I talked to you about this last month or not.  If not, 
would you mind giving Brent a hand with his broker agreement?

I am working on preparing a new form of Broker Agreement for Don.  Is there a 
form that ECT has used in the past?  The version we will be drafting will 
have certain non-traditional obligations on the broker such as the obligation 
to find a seller for the buyer's consumption requirements, guarantee to 
seller the buyers payment obligations and so forth.  Do you think Vicky may 
have prepared broker agreements for EES?  If my description is too vague call
me and I can describe it in more detail.  Thanks.
