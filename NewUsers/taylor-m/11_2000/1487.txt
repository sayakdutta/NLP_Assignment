Thank you for an overwhelming response to participate in ClickAtHome's Second 
Pilot.    For those of you who have signed up, we are excited to have you in 
this pilot.  We look forward to you testing our process and services and 
giving us feedback!

In order to be eligible for Pilot 2, please read and agree to the Pilot 

email box with the following statement:    "I accept the terms and conditions 
of this Pilot Participant Agreement." with the Pilot agreement attached.

Once we have received your acceptance,  you will be eligible and confirmed 
for Pilot 2.

Those who are confirmed for Pilot 2 will receive an email the week of 
November 13th on how and when they can access the ordering website.  Until 
that point,  the website will not be accessible.

Employees will have great options under this program for computers, 
peripherals, and Internet connectivity.   Your personal selections will 
determine your out-of-pocket expense, if any.  

We know you are interested in more details.  However, one of our primary 
Pilot objectives is to test the communication on the website.  We would like 
you to review more details about program offerings and related out-of-pocket 
costs, if any, once the pilot website is available.  After agreeing to the 
Pilot Participants Agreement and reviewing these materials on the website, 
you may choose to defer ordering until the All Employee roll-out in early 
2001 if you wish.




Thanks!
