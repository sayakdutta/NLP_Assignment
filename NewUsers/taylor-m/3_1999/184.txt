Thanks for your help - is Scott is in Houston today?  Maybe I could meet with 
him here.  Any chance he will be back in BA by Tuesday? (I am scheduled to 
leave Tuesday night.)

Scott Neal will not be in BA on monday (he will probably make it for 
Wednesday).

Don Black's agenda is open so I added this meeting on his schedule at 10:00am.

Have a nice trip and I will send you a car to pick you up.

C.
