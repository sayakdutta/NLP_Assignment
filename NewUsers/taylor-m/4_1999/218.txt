Scott:

I have a call scheduled with Martin for tomorrow morning to discuss these 
CFTC  issues.  I'll let you know how it goes.

I have also not forgotten your request for my view on Martin's tenure in 
Houston.  I have mixed feelings that are difficult to put down in writing and 
I'm hoping we can take a few minutes in New Orleans to discuss.
