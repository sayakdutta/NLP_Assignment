In this case I would say do whatever is easiest for you guys.  Since we know 
that Enron Canada is qualified, we don't really have to have the 
representation but if it is easier for you to not make an exception, it 
doesn't hurt to have it in.


   
	
	
		


Mark,

Concerning the representation language given to us recently for Canada 
based/located Counterparties; Should we also include this paragraph in Risk 
Management & Trading vs. Enron Canada deals?

I have spoken to Dale Neuner, who has since forwarded me on to you.  He has 
mentioned that, based on your conversation with him, we may not be concerned 
with an intercompany party needing this representation.  Let us know what you 
think.

Thanks,
Joe Hunter
