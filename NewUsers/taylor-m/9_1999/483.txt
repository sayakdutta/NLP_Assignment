All -

I'll be on leave from this coming Thursday 23 September through to next 
Friday 1 October.  Matthias Lee will be providing all the legal support for 
all the physical and financial trading matters and general Singapore-office 
related matters during my absence.  However, you may call me on my handphone 
(tel: 9670-4134) should you need to reach me urgently.

Thanks,
Anita
