Please note that Mark Dilworth's demonstration scheduled for tomorrow morning 
(11:00 EB2601a) will not be of the entire EnronOnline system but will focus 
on the portion of the system that builds the long descriptions.  The system 
now builds the entire long description from the various elements - most of 
which we have already reviewed - and displays them as they will be viewed by 
counterparties online.  It is particularly important that the lawyers 
responsible for the long descriptions and the GTC's attend so that we can 
complete the review process.  If you can not attend, please let me know so we 
can set up a time for Mark to show you how to access the system.

Thanks,

Mark
