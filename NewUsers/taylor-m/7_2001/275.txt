Here is the first of the no more confirms agreements.  Can you please handle this one?  Even though it came to me over two weeks ago I didn't realize this was ready for us until the back office and EOL people called asking for it (entirely my fault) so there is a certain urgency to it.  I also have counterparties for Francisco, Sara and Frank to get started on, but I thought you would be better for the urgent one since you have the most experience with these issues.

I tweaked the one that I sent you yesterday.  Here's the  final version.
