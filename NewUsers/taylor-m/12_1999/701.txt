I do have some issues with the proposed language and will be discussing the 
details with Dale tomorrow.

Mark,

could you please have a final glance at  Short and Long Descriptions for the 
5th of January EnronOnline launch.
In the file attached are the examples of the following product descriptions:

-  Emissions
-  Weather
-  US Liquids  Financial

If we do not hear from you by the end of the day Wednesday, Dec 22nd, we'll 
assume that the descriptions are fine as they are, and no changes are needed.

Thank you,
Elena
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!
