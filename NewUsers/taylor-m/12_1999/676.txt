Lucy:

Cemex has previously signed a confidentiality agreement with us based on our 
form of agreement.  Their form is significantly more burdensome for us.  I 
would prefer that we send our form and let them know that it is substantially 
similar to one previously executed in connection with another matter.

Morning to all,

Cemex would like us to sign this confidentiality agreement.  Would you please 
look it over and let me know if it is ok for Lynda to sign?

Many thanks,

Lucy

George,
      As discussed, attached are files containing public data on cement
consumption in S. Texas.  I will work on getting a confidentiality agreement
progressed.    Thanks,  GPB
