That's fine with me - I don't anticipate any problems at this point.  Don't 
worry about losing days, though.  We can always make under the table 
adjustments next month if necessary.

Mark:
I apparently have 1 1/2 days left.  How would you feel about me taking 
Thursday P.M. and next Tuesday off, assuming that I get these year-end deals 
closed?  Feel free to say no to Thursday if you are not comfortable having 
only 1 attorney here.
