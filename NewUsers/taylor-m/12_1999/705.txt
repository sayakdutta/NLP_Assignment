This looks fine to me.  Is this the way our confirmations read for telephone 
trades?  If not, do we need to make this change there also?

Dale,

I have discussed the wording with Rudy and agree that we could change the 
wording in the Index long description for Gasoline, #2 and WTI as follows:


Old:

The Index for a month shall be the arithmetic average of the daily  
settlement 
prices for the prompt month NYMEX West Texas Intermediate Light, Sweet, Crude 
Oil 
futures contract for each NYMEX trading day of such month.



New:

The Index for a Determination Period shall be the arithmetic average of the 
daily  
settlement prices for the promptmonth NYMEX West Texas Intermediate Light, 
Sweet, 
Crude Oil futures contract for each NYMEX trading day of such Determination 
Period.



Please run these changes past legal before proceeding. When your changes are 
complete, please run the final version past Rudy as well. Please note that 
all 
Products which reference these Indexes will need the secret squirrel 
treatment for 
updating.

Niamh/Duncan: Please advise if you are happy for the above change to be 
applied 
to your products as well.

Thanks,

Dave
