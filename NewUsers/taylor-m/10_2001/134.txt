I have forwarded these on to Chris Long (who will get back to me on Monday) and left a message for Ken to let him know I will send it on to him as soon as Chris signs off.

 

Mark,  with these and my comments ( which I did not forward to Ken, have you?) we should be done. 


Jim --

Sorry this took so long.  Here are my changes.  I don't think that I did any major damage, just didn't want Enron to say that all volatility was and is the result of deregulation.

Thanks,

Jim
