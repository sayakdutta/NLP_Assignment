Let's get together with Sara and Mary to discuss how we should move forward with the forms.

 

Mark,
Do we want to propose they use the Industrial (which is the document I believe they were previously given) or do we want to ISDA'ize it for them to review?

Brent--there is a lot of talk down here about wanting to use a "short from" financial master for recurring trades with retail counterparties.  There have been a couple of drafts floating around in connection with the now defunct Fast Track initiative.  Is there a standard form of a short form financial master that has already been fully reviewed by the company and that would be ready and proper for EES to use?  Thanks.  MDS
