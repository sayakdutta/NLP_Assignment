I have no objection to changing the product name.  The tax issue concerns the 
location of the trader - if the guy managing the prices is in London but the 
transactions are with ENA, there may be tax implications.

Mark,

I have not yet been contacted by legal/tax regarding the change of 
description for PIX indices.  We still basically want only to delete "US" and 
replace it with "PIX".  To my simplistic, non-legal, mind this is a pretty 
simple issue....can't we just do it??

Bob
