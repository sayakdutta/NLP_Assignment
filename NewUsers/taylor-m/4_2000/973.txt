Hey Marc! - We're in town this weekend - let us know if you plan something.

















G & I were discussing having a Sunday afternoon cocktail party next Sunday
(Palm Sunday, April 16).  Considering it is kind of last minute, and it is
Palm Sunday weekend, we wanted to take a quick poll:

Question:
If we planned a gathering between 2pm-5pm on Sunday would you be able to
attend.

Thanks for your help.
