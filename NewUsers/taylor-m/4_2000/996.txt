Nedre:

We have interviewed four candidates so far and may be able to decide on one 
of them - the group will be meeting early next week to discuss everyone's 
reactions to the interviews.  If you have other resumes we would be happy to 
look at them - my own view is that while these candidates would be OK, they 
are not superstars (like the person we are losing).

Mark,

I was wondering how close you and your group are to making a decision
on the Paralegal position.   I know you have seen some candidates.  Would you 
like
to continue to see more or do you want to choose from the pool that you have 
already seen?

I haven't heard much feedback (evaluation sheets or email) from the 
interviewing group, and 
I need to know what you all think of the candidates.  Please let me know 
where we are at your 
earliest convenience.

Thanks,
Nedre Strambler
