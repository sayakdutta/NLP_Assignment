Just a couple of comments and questions:

Is it appropriate to refer to these as "US" transactions since the prices are 
clearly from outside the US?  I recognize that ENA is the counterparty but I 
think this may be confusing to our customers.

The term Business Day should be capitalized (it's defined in the GTC) [but 
it's defined with reference to NY & Houston banks being open - does that work 
for pulp transactions?].

I'm not thrilled with the language for the last ten days of the contract 
period on the Pulpex description - is that what we use for current 
confirmations?

In the definition of the Index for the Finnish product, the word "relevent" 
should be deleted.
