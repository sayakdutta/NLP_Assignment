don't know if G has already email you... Heights Blvd is now only one lane.
if you have time, please email your complaints to the people referenced in
G's long & attached email.

I just got Ms. Dorsey's email address, it's


   
                        carlssmith; jstys; morlanwhittle; Marc.Cutler
   

   If any of you care to voice your opinion about Height Blvd. the best
   person to speak to is:
   Mignette Dorsey, City of Houston Bikeway Coordinator


   713-837-0003

   I spoke to her and found out that this has been planned since the
   early 90's (see how fast our government works).  She said that she
   has received several complaints but the project will continue until
   completion (they have to put down the bike symbols) before it would
   be reconsidered.  If you don't like the restriped Heights Blvd. I
   suggest you call Ms. Dorsey and email the following:

   Jeff King - Public Works




   Robert Litke - Planning & Development Dept


   Annise Parker - City Councilwoman




   Thanks!!
