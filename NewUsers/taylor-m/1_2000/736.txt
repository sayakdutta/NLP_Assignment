We need to revise the Counterparty Matrix procedures.  Counterparties with a 
North American financial master agreement should only map to North American 
financial products (including all weather and paper transactions).  
Therefore, please revise the counterparty matrix to reflect that those 
counterparties with a North American master map to GTC's for European 
derivative transactions.  Please call me or Tana if you have any questions.

Thanks!

Mark
