In case you are looking for value stocks to evaluate, this is the list of 
stocks in my "value" portfolio:

Baxter Intl  BAX
Blockbuster  BBI
Circuit City CC
Cognex Corp  CGNX
Corning Inc  GLW
Duke Energy  DUK
Edison Intern EIX
First Data Corp FDC
I2 Technologies ITWO
Internatl Paper IP
KLA-Tencor  KMAG
OM Group Inc OMP
Scientific Atlanta  SFA
Southwest Air LUV
STMicroelctro STM
United Parcel UPS

Idon't mean to recommend any of these - particualrly since the Smith Barney 
people have told me they have lost confidence in this particular manager and 
are looking for another one.
