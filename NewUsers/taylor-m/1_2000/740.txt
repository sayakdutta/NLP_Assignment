Mark,

As discussed, here is the URL for the proposed web site:   
http://ecthou-lndev1.nt.ect.enron.com/westpowernet.nsf/
It is still on an internal server which I hope you will have access to.  Let 
me know if it doesn't work.  

The User ID is: "user1"  and the Password is:  "test"  .

I also ran through several of the web sites from which we gather our 
information and did not run across the occurance of any copyright statements.

In terms of timing, we hope to release the site by the end of January to a 
limited customer listing.

Regards,
