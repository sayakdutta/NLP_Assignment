The EOL help desk received a call from Isabelle Ealet at J Aron in London 
(0171 774 2103).  She was asking them why she could not trade with her id and 
password that she had been given.

I called her and explained that she could not use a Guest Id to trade and 
told her that she needed to send in a UK PA (explained to her the location of 
the form on the web site).  She said she would send one to us.

Then she told me that it was not a problem anyway because she called her New 
York office and asked them to give her and id - they set her up as a sub 
user.  She then told me that she transacted a deal in London for EN590.  I 
told her that her PA would not cover this and I am not sure she understood 
this ?

Therefore she will have transacted in London under a US PA - correct ?  
Please advise as to how we are to deal with this.

Thanks
