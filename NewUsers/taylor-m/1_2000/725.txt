We are scheduled at Ken Raisler's office at 9:00 on Thursday.  The address is 
125 Broad Street (on the eastern end of Broad St. - right by the East 
River).  See you there!

Thanks, Mark

Thursday works well for Bryan and me, so please book Ken's slot!

We'll travel out on Wednesday night.

Regards

Paul




I have now heard back from Ken Raisler's office that the only time he has 
left next week is Thursday morning.  Does that work for you guys?
