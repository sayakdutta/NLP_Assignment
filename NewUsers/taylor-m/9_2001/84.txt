Sounds good to me.

 

Mark:

The PLI has a 2-day seminar in Houston on Nov. 5 and 6 which I would like to attend (mega-refresher course for me).  The cost is $1295.  Although I have been looking for a seminar about equity derivatives, this seminar will be helpful in the context of ENE forwards and other affiliated equity deals from the securities vantage point.

Let me know if you would like to see the brochure.
