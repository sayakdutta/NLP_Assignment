I'm in London today and tomorrow but plan to be in the office in Houston on Thursday.  Since it'll be my first day back after being out for over a week, it would probably be best to book some time to make sure you get me.  But if that doesn't work, try and stop by anyway.
 

I wanted to let you know that I am going to be in Houston next week for a derivatives course on Tuesday and Wednesday.  My flight doesn't leave until 1 pm on Thursday, so I thought I would come in and wander around the office Thursday morning before I leave.
