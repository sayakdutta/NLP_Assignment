I made it back to Houston last night.  Incredible security at the airport in London -- it was a mob scene.  In addition to the usual stuff there was an additional search of all carry-ons by hand at the gate and all passengers were patted down by a guard before entering the gate.  I saw several passengers questioned on the plane about their checked luggage -- I couldn't really hear what it was all about.  We were delayed about two and a half hours but it made it feel a little safer.  The Brits were all very nice of course while I was in London but it sure is good to be home.
