I made it back to Houston last night.  Incredible security at the airport in London -- it was a mob scene.  In addition to the usual stuff there was an additional search of all carry-ons by hand at the gate and all passengers were patted down by a guard before entering the gate.  I saw several passengers questioned on the plane about their checked luggage -- I couldn't really hear what it was all about.  We were delayed about two and a half hours but it made it feel a little safer.  The Brits were all very nice of course but it sure is good to be home.  

 

So good it was London. I was worried because like me you travel so much. I
can't tell you how many phone calls I have had this past week. Not everyone
is familiar with NYC geography of course and knowing I travel, were
concerned. This is all just so horrible. Talk to you when you get back.
