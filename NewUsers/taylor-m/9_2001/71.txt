What about Noble?  Has he moved into his new place in midtown yet?

 

Amanda came back yesterday.  Bill didn't want to fly to Europe and Amanda was able to get on a flight back.  They are going to take a little vacation here in the U.S.

Skadden was amazingly lucky.  We have so many people it seems impossible that we didn't have anyone in the blast.  A messenger who works for a messenger service was delivering a package for us and he is unaccounted for.  And in the case of family members, so far only one associate has reported a missing brother.   It is so amazing how lucky we were.

I have a paralegal who lives in the blast area - Claudia Hong - but she came to work early that day.  She can't get in her apartment so I am looking for temporary housing for her.  She is on Oscar's couch ( you met Oscar at the party) right now.  But I have to find something better.  Let me know if you know anyone in Manhattan who has an empty apt for a week or two.

Keep in touch


Thanks for making my morning.  I'm still grinning at the image of your bags
going back and forth across the Atlantic.

I saw the emergency command center on TV the other night and it looked just
like that huge room where we stood in line and checked in for the ship.  I
think that's why they can't dock in ny.

Has Amanda made it back yet?

   Andrea found the bags. They are still on the QE2 going back and forth
   across the ocean.  The QE2 can't come to ny. It is going to dock in
   boston on sept 28. They are going to ups our two bags to us from boston.
