While I think the law actually works that way, we have avoided putting it in writing so far.  The way the web site works, the decision to accept or reject the offer happens almost instantaneously so the question is almost meaningless.  The time we care is when the internet slows down or the connection goes down and they don't see that we accepted their offer and then they try to get out.  I guess the other question would be how do they withdraw the offer?  The website doesn't provide a mechanism for that.  If we say it has to be in writing and delivered to the relevant trader, in practice it might not be an issue.

 

Mark:  We met briefly about 2 months ago when I interviewed here.  I just joined Wayne in the coal group and am working on a Master Coal Purchase and Sale Agreement.  The counterparty has suggested some language (highlighted below) which sounds o.k. to me.  However, Wayne suggested I run it by you to see if it worked with the way the website actually operates.  Please advise.

Thanks,
