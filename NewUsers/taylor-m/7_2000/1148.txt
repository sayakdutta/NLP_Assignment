This sounds reasonable to me - any objections?

I have learned that the time stamp is not our own but Reuters--so it is the 
time of the last trade.  I assume, then, that it's okay to give people that 
additional information as long as we have the quotes delayed by 20 minutes 
disclaimer?

Thanks Mark

Will the Reuters feed contain a time stamp?  Some other sites let you know 
what  time the trade was done that resulted in the quote.

Dear Mark

Do you know of any legal issue that there could be about adding our own time 
stamp to a stock quote from Reuters (so that people viewing the site would 
know when the stock quotes were last updated by us)?

Let me know if I should direct this question to someone else.

Thanks Mark

Jay
