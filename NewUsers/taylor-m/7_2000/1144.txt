Paul -

I think we handled this in Phase I through the Legal and Privacy Statement 
which is available through a link from each EnronOnline page, including the 
home page.  If memory serves, the advice (including the language for the 
Legal and Privacy Statement) came from Clifford Chance.  Justin will probably 
be able to fill you in on our thinking at the time.  Will that be sufficient 
for Phase II?  We can revise the Legal and Privacy Statement if that is 
necessary.

Guys,
 Paul Simon's has advised us that EnronOnline will need to include standard 
SFA language on each Home Page in the garden area where we are promoting the 
services of EnronOnline as we are offering a system which would allow a 
registered user to enter into financial products. This would inculde the 
EnronOnline main Home page in addition to all the new URLs that we are 
setting up for the different markets.
Paul should be able to suppply theh standard disclaimner language required.
regards
Nick

Paul could you please send the standard language thate would be required to 
Dave Samuels.
