Just wanted to let you know that it doesn't look like I'll be able to make it to NY this weekend as previously planned.  I'll let you know if that changes.

Mark, I am sure you are overwhelmed on other projects, but I wanted to make
sure that you had received the attached.  I have some comments / questions
on the form of Electronic Trading Agreement you sent me.  No rush, just call
me at your convenience.

I hope you are well.  Nobel started this week -- a great excuse to go out
for a nice lunch!

Regards,  David
