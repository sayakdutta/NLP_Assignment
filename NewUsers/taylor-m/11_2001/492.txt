Thanks for the note -- not to worry about the music.  I didn't have the necessary plug-in to play it and it wouldn't have been too loud anyway.  Thanks for the thought.  It's been pretty rough but the merger announcement should calm things a bunch.

Sorry about the music on the card I sent you from work.  I don't have
sound capability on my computer there and didn't know until I got home
that there even was music!   If you get this one first, I recommend you
turn off your sound before you look at that card.

Love, Mother
