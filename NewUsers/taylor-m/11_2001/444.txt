draft Source Code License Agreement  that is intended to serve as the basis
for discussion / decisions within Enron. You will note that we have included
comments and questions for Enron to review.

Please let me know if you would like us to participate in discussions or if
you would like to report back any changes that Enron requires.

Regards,
David
