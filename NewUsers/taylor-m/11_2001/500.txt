Sorry about that.  I have been a bit preoccupied.  I put them in the car so I would remember to take care of it and took them with me this weekend so I could stop at the post office.  It turns out the neighborhood office is closed on Saturdays and of course they were all closed on Monday.  You should have them tomorrow.  

 

I just went to order the pictures we had taken at the photographer's in
August.  They wouldn't let me order without the proofs.  They said there
are more numbers on the back of the proofs than we have.  Do you still
have the proofs?  I hope so, because they haven't come in the mail yet.
We would really appreciate it if you could send them as soon as possible.
 It takes four weeks to get the finished pictures after they are ordered
and we want to put some wallet sized copies in Christmas cards.  I hope
things have calmed down for you some at work.  I really hate to bother
you with this.

Love, Mother
