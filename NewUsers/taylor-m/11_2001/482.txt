Thanks David -- I appreciate that.  I'm thinking when this all calms down, I'll just take a couple of days off and come up to the city for fun -- not wait for a business trip.  I'll give you a ring if anything really interesting comes up.

 

Hi,  Sorry to hear that -- don't worry about it.  I hope all is well and
definitely let me know if things change (h: 212.721.8051).  I have some new
restaurants I want to try so you'll have to come up with an excuse to come
up soon!

David




Just wanted to let you know that it doesn't look like I'll be able to make
it to NY this weekend as previously planned.  I'll let you know if that
changes.

   Mark, I am sure you are overwhelmed on other projects, but I wanted to
   make
   sure that you had received the attached.  I have some comments /
   questions
   on the form of Electronic Trading Agreement you sent me.  No rush, just
   call
   me at your convenience.

   I hope you are well.  Nobel started this week -- a great excuse to go
   out
   for a nice lunch!

   Regards,  David
