I'm not sure.  There was a comment by Sally Beck at the last meeting that she was trying to figure out which of her direct reports should be attending so maybe it has something to do with that.  I don't really know what changed though.

 


Mark, do you know  any of the details of the new reporting structure referred to below????
 
Cc:	Chisley, Katherine; Beffer, Michele; Brandli, Christina; Browder, Mary Lou; Cannon, Lydia; Carrizales, Blanca; Choate, Heather; Costello, Lisa; Craig, Braedi; Estrada, Mercedes E.; Farrell, Keegan; Flores-Cuellar, Brenda; Houser, Rita; James, Giselle; Keiser, Holly; Lapsley, Carol; McDonald, Dawn; Perkins, Kim; Spiller, Tina; Stone, Sandy; Valdez, Christina; Villanueva, Chantelle; Weatherstone, Mary; Westbrook, Cherylene R.

Due to recent changes in the reporting structure at ENW, changes were necessary to the structure of the ENW Weekly Executive Staff Meeting on Thursdays at noon.

The staff meeting will now be held bi-weekly, beginning November 15, in the ECS 04990 conference room.  You will continue to get a reminder on the Tuesday before the meeting.

Please let me know if you have any questions.
