I have no legal objections to the presentation.  I do have to wonder if it is 
wise from a commercial perspective to so heavily emphasize the importance of 
the success of EnronOnline to the company's business on the platform itself.

Mark,

I have attached new audio and new slides of Jeff Skilling's Enron Overview 
presentation to be reviewed by Legal before being posted on the EnronOnline 
site.  We would like to post this new presentation as soon as possible 
because the existing one is rather dated (it was done last September).

 <--- This is a Windows Media Player file  

The existing presentation (if you'd like to see it for comparison) is at 
http://www.enrononline.com/docs/marketing/Markets/ - click on Presentations / 
Enron Overview in the left-hand navigation.

This is Skilling's "standard" presentation, so there is nothing in it which 
has not already been presented publicly before.

Please let me know if these files have your approval for the EnronOnline 
site, or contact me if you have any questions or comments.

Thanks,
Erica Bess Duncan
