We have thought about this from time to time.  Our primary concern has not =
been the strict adherence to the contractual notice requirements (because o=
f the lack of substantive concern you mention) but the fear of possible wai=
ver of rights that might take place if the requests are not consistent or h=
andled carefully.  These are all issues that apply to trading margin calls =
generally.  Most recently Carol St. Clair, who Mark H. has asked to be the =
point lawyer for Credit and credit issues, has been working on this problem=

ject: Margin Calls - Financial=09


Mark, I recently was dealing with Russell in Credit on a margin call letter=
 for IMC Canada and it seemed to me that the letter in substance met Credit=
's requirements but did not comply with the ISDA in terms of formalities (i=
.e. use of defined terms, currency specification, notice and delivery timin=
g, notice addresses, etc.).  It seemed to me that the form they are using m=
ay have been drafted some time ago and needs to be updated so that it is no=
t a drafting exercise on a case by case basis.  Practically, to the extent =
that the counterparty will not object to delivery, there really is no subst=
antive concern.  However, as credit is becoming a significant issue in comm=
odity markets, if the counterparty wants to object, particularly in circums=
tances where their credit is getting "tight", I can see the lack of contrac=
tual compliance perhaps being problematic.  Can somebody in your group deve=
lop a template (perhaps a few will be required) that could be used under th=
e Enron form, the "industrial" form, the ISDA form and for Canada.  Please =
call Russell, Bill or me to discuss.  Peter.
