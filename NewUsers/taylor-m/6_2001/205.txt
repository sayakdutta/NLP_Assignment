      Applications


   We  are  in  the  process  of  preparing applications for position limit
   exemptions  for  ENA's  NYMEX energy commodities futures trading.  These
   applications require that ENA represent whether its officers, employees,
   owners,  or agents have a power of attorney, control or have a financial
   interest  in any related commodity future(s) account either individually
   or acting with another person pursuant to express or implied agreement.

   Please   direct   any   responses  to  my  paralegal,  Tana  Jones,  via
   intercompany  email or call her at (713) 853-3399 by the end of business
   on  June  15,  2001 if you have any power of attorney, control or have a
   financial  interest  in any commodity futures account (other than an ENA
   or other trading affiliate account).

   IF  YOU  DO  NOT  HAVE  A  COMMODITY FUTURES ACCOUNT, YOU DO NOT NEED TO
   RESPOND TO THIS REQUEST.
