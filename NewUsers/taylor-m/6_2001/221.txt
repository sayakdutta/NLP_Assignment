It really was unbelievable.  Our neighborhood usually doesn't have too much=
 trouble but the velocity of the rain (at one point they say it was 6" per =
hour) was so high that it just couldn't drain away that fast.  The water go=
t so high that it was several inches high in the garage (not high enough to=
 get in the car), covered the pool and completely surrounded the house.  It=
 looks like it covered the porch and got right up to the top of the slab si=
nce some of the floor boards are starting to warp, but not as high as the d=
oor sills since none actually came in.  Just one more inch and I'd be in bi=
g trouble.  Luckily I slept through the whole thing - if I'd been awake I w=
ould have totally freaked and started carrying rugs & furniture to the seco=
nd floor -- a lot of trouble and anxiety for nothing since it never did com=
e inside.  The garage apt. tenant parks on the street and her car had water=
 inside and it wouldn't start without being jumped.  I got home about midni=
ght the night it happened and it was raining but the street was clear -- no=
 standing water anywhere.  By the time I got up in the morning it was all g=
one.

Interstate 10 where it goes near our place (say from downtown out to the lo=
op) looked like a river - the water filled the entire thing all the way up =
to the bottoms of the overpass bridges!  I didn't see it myself but I hear =
that 59 was the same way where it dips down between Montrose and Shepherd. =
 You missed a big one!

I got a Nikon Coolpix 880.  I didn't do much research so I don't know how
good/bad it is in comparison to other cameras on the market.  It was pretty
much an impulse buy.  I like it, but I don't know if a digital camera is
better than a regular camera.

Here are a few pictures from my trip to Lisbon.

I saw a few pictures of the Houston floods...unbelievable.  I hope you
didn't have any problems with your house.

Nice photos - they're incredibly detailed.  Are you happy with the camera?
I've thought about getting one but there are so many different
brands/options/details/prices I can't figure out which one I would want!

Here are a few from our recent trips, taken with a regular camera that we
also got on a picture CD when they were developed:
