I just faxed it to you.  Let me know.

Mike




Mike-

Did you get a chance to fax me this morning? In addition, I want to speak 
with you for a few minutes at the end of the day. There are a few more key 
bits of information that I want to pass along to you before the meeting 
tonight. Does 4:30 - 5:00 PM (your time) work for you?

Alex
