I made some big changes to the index curves tonight.  Please run a new P&L 
early in the morning in order to estimate what the changes in book value will 
be.  I will need to let John Lavorado know about the changes to the curves 
before we decide to book these tomorrow.   Please run a report from the 
transport model so that I may see the changes to the delivery points.

Thanks,
Mike
