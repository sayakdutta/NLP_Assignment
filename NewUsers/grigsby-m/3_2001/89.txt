Dear Jeff,

I am interested in summarizing all of our contracts in the western region and 
identifying any problems (i.e. penalty language, notification deadlines for 
OFOs, etc.) that may need to be addressed.  We have experienced a few 
problems with SW Gas Corp. recently.  They have been penalizing Enron for 
cuts on EPNG, but when we pursued penalties with them on a baseload one month 
deal last month, they claimed that all one month deals have been booked on an 
interruptible contract and cannot be penalized.  This was news to me.  Can 
you help me identify what types of contracts we are using to transact 
business with our customers in the west?

I can honestly say that these contracts have not been reviewed by the west 
desk for some time.  Phillip Allen transferred the desk to me  in August of 
2000 and I have not spent the time to review all of contracts.  Let's get 
together and discuss exactly what I may need.

Sincerely,
Mike Grigsby
