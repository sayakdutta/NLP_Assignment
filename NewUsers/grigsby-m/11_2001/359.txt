Jess,
 
Could you please ensure I get access to O:\ECT Trading\West?  I do not have permission on this folder yet.
 
Thanks.
 
Phil

Please begin organizing all files in the west folder on the network.  I would like all files associated with the west to be organized in the event people rotate out of the group.  Set up any folders in the west that you need to organize data.
 
This includes fundamentals, regulatory, risk (basis position summaries, prices, index surveys, etc.), etc.
 
Please forward to anyone that maintains files for the west.  
 
Kam and Barry Tycholiz should have their groups follow through with this task.  Please email me when this is done.
 
Barry, please have Phil move and maintain files from the west directory.
 
Thanks,
Mike
