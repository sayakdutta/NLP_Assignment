He came over from Broadband.  We think this guy is great.  We would like to rank him high enough to keep.  Try 40 and higher.

Thanks,
Mike

 

yes if you have an idea of where he should go?  did he come from another rotation in trading?

 

Please place her at 60 or below.  She is under a performance review plan and has been removed from Trading Track.  

Zack McCarroll started with the west desk two weeks ago.  Do we need to add him to the list?

Thanks,
Mike

 

she was not.  do you need to see the list again to know where to rank her?

 

Was Elizabeth Shim on the list?  I can't remember.
