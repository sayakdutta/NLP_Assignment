Chris,

We would like to claim Brent Dornier for the west when he begins his Trading Track rotation.  What are your thoughts?

Hi Mike,

Yes, I have him initially put him down for Gas Fundies and spoke to Gaskill about your interest in having him assigned to you from there.

Kind regards,

Karen.

 

Keith Holst, from our west desk, met with Brent Dornier last week in London and Brent mentioned that he might be interested in joining the west gas trading desk.  We would like try and get him for his first Trading Track rotation.  

Thanks,
Mike Grigsby
