We will need to discuss how to adjust physical risk to match the flow 
constraints on EPNG.  The currrent capacity cuts in the SJ and Socal topock 
delivery points are 50%.  I would like my P&L to show this risk.  Please find 
a way to adjust the positions according to a daily flow curve that can be set 
in newcurrentday by either myself or Monique.  

Also, We will need to set up a new physical curve for Mojave Topock.  Our 
transport is currently being reallocated by EPNG for deliveries to Mojave 
instead of Socal topock.  I would like to show the transport on EPNG value as 
SJ plus cost to Mojave and have the value roll out each month, if any.  The 
risk is showing the value of SJ to Socal topock (currently wide spreads for 
2001) on the transport when it actually has less value delivering to Mojave 
topock.

Sincerely,
Mike
