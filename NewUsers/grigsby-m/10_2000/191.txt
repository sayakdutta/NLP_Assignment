Please read the following email from EOL.  I have asked them to assist the 
West desk in mailing out an ad to all of our customers (utilities, producers, 
industrials, and some IPPs) notifying them of our plan to reduce the minimum 
volume accepted on all of our EOL products.  Start thinking of which 
customers should be on the list and try to think of a creative way to present 
this to our customers.  EOL has asked us to provide them with the text of our 
message.

Also, let's go ahead and reduce the min volume on our products (primarily all 
phys and gas dailies) this week.  We are attempting to capture all of the odd 
lot flow in the market.  I would see this service as a clear advantage over 
the other web platforms.  

Let's get together on Friday afternoon at Ninfa's to discuss our ideas.

Thanks,
Mike

Per our conversation last week.  Sorry for the delay.  We can help you with 
your mailout.  Please see the following and contact Kal Shah with additional

Will be happy to help this group.  They'll need to agree to the following:

1.  They pay for the cost (to be determined depending on the quality of the 
mailing)
2.  They provide a mailing list with following separate columns:
First name
Last Name
Company Name
Address
City
State
Zip
3.  Give us a draft of the text for the mailing
4.  Give us 5 working days to get it out.  (we will try to do it faster, but 
it depends on several factors)
