Thank you.  Phillip Allen sits right behind me and he let me know that he was going to contact you.  We will see you in Houston.

Mike,

I spoke with Phillip Allen yesterday, and I've received word that I've been invited to interview for the trading track on Thursday. Just wanted to let you know where things stand.

Regards,

I am having trouble dialing your number.  I spoke to Randy Bhatia and he recommended you with confidence.  After reviewing your resume I would like to go ahead and recommend that you come to the interview process in November.  Please call me at work when you get a chance, 713-853-7031.

Thanks, 

Mike Grigsby
