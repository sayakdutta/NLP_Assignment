Will you please add the prices for the power and add a key showing the variable rates and the O&M used for calculating the spark spread?

Nice job.  Thank you for publishing this each day.

Thanks,
Mike

P.S. I nominated you to interview for the Trading Track.  It is your option.

 

This is yesterday's file... how do the spark spreads look?  Wasn't sure if you want heat rates based on next-day prices...

Let me know if you want me to make any other modifications.  Otherwise, I'll continue to send this out ASAP as a daily routine.
