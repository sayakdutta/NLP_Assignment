Hi Mike,

I will be out this week, but just wanted to recap what
I spoke to you about earlier last week.  Mike Pena with Unify,
along with Chris Hyde and Dave Dronet in the Fundies group are looking into
connecting the Unify database with the cuts information in Passport this week.
When I come back I will let you know what they have done and help them on the commercial side with El Paso.

If you have any suggestions while this is in progress, please contact
myself or Chris Hyde.

Thank you.

-Liz.
