Ryan has done a great job creating and maintaining the basis pricing sheet.  I would like you guys to add two more tabs to the file.  Please add a physical and finacial index pricing sheet with the same format.  We may need to create a more elaborate fin index curve file to accomodate this file.  Please show me the fin index curve file tomorrow so that we may update.  Let me know what you think.
 
Thanks,
Mike
