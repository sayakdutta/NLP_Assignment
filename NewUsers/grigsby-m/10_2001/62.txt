Keith and I discussed working towards this meeting being organized every week.  We would like the meeting to begin at 3:00 and to have all interested parties (Canada and Portland) dialed in to AT&T.  I would like the meeting room cleared and the handouts to be emailed before the meeting begins.  Please work towards emailing everyone an itinerary each week.

You guys are making great progress with the fundies information.  Nice work.

Thanks,
Mike
