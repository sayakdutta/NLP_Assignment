Changed just a few minor things in the summary.  Please look at the titles and arrangement of the positions in the summary.

Thanks,
Mike

 

How is the last revision that you sent me of the position report different than the version you revised earlier yesterday?

Attached are the reports for today.  I neglected to realize that I hadn't yet created formulas for the change columns, so today they aren't working.  By tomorrow, they will be.

I have hard copies printed out if you want them; I'll bring them down in a second.
