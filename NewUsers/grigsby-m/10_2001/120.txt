I have added two spots on the desk for logistics.  I thought it would be best to have one rep for the Rockies, Stacy Brewer and one for the Southwest, Shannon Groenewald.  It would be nice to have Patti on the floor, but it would be like taking the teacher from the classroom.  

Let me know what you think.
