Thank you for the offer.  Courtney and I are going to the TX/OU game.

I just found out Courtney and I have our ranch this weekend.  Are any of
you open to taking the wives and kids up there?    I would probably take
Friday off.

Pls let me know asap.

Also, still hoping to go fishing the weekend of October 20th if anyone
is up for it.  Just guys on that one.

Thanks,
Curtis
