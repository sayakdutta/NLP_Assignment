Jeff said that he spoke to you. I requested that they restate P&L for yesterday.  One issue is that I set the GD Index curves and Phys Index curves as usual, but Anne failed to pull in Index.  She pulled in only price and basis.  She will fix this going forward.

Reitmeyer's P&L was an issue with Logistics.  His transport tickets were not put in until 4:00 yesterday - too late to capture.  We will talk to Superty about this.  His P&L will be -610,000, a 1.3 million increase.

Frank Ermis is still looking into his issues.

I will call you after cash trading.
