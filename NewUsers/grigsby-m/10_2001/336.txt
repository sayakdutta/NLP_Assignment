CAN WE RUN THIS FILE EVERY NIGHT?  ARE THE POSITIONS FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE OR THE COUNTERPARTY'S?

THANKS!

 

Attached is the new file with the volumes converted to contracts.

Thank you.  Will you please convert the positions to contracts.

Mike

 

Mike: Attached is the data you wanted for the West Desk, only.  Credit can give you the information for the entire floor.  Russell Diamond has been called back to work on the project.  I would still use Tanya as the contact.

Now that all of the data has been collected for the West, we can sort and present it however you want on Monday.

Have a good weekend.

Thanks
