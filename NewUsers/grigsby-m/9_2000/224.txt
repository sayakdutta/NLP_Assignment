I created the term gd basis products for waha, perm, sj, opal, and malin this 
weekend.  Call Dale or Melba to activate.  Keith and I briefly discussed how 
we would handle the new responsibility.  I am fine with managing the prompt 
month gd basis, while you guys manage the term.  I will be back in the office 
this week and we can talk about the products.  Would we handle the monthly 
the same way?  When do we plan to phase the monthly out?  Have Phillip manage 
the perm and waha basis until I return.  

Dale is also working on the Baja and Redwood on/off system spreads.  We can 
roll these out for all terms as well.

See you this week.
