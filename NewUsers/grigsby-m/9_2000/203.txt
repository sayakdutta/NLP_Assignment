Sorry I didn't get back to you sooner.  Thank you for the invite the other 
day.  I just had my second child, so I am little busy.  We will be turning on 
the box with natsource gas daily today.  I apologize for the inconvenience.  
The information reported internally warranted suspending business with 
Natsource for a few days.  I am not interested in hearing your side of the 
story.  Business as usual here forward.

Sincerely,

Mike Grigsby
