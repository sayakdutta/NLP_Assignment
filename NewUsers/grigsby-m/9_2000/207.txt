Tom,

See the email below for the ID and password.

Call me on Monday to discuss the download process, if you should have any 
questions.  You will log into www.enrononline.com and I think you will need 
to download shockwave media (the site should walk you through this process).  
Once you have typed in the ID and password, you will then have the option of 
setting up a personalized quote page.  Also, call me about where to see our 
posted daily indices each day on the website.  Enron releases the weighted 
average of all gas traded at each physical point every day.

Thanks,

Mike
