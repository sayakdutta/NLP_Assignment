I saw that, unbelievable huh?  The sad thing is that the folks I work with never heard of Jack Kerouac nor "On the Road".  
Probably not surprising considering most are from Texas.  How's everything going?  Did you get an opportunity to call
Kampy.  How's the job search progressing?

Before I forget, was there a guy in our MBA class named Chris Sevrson or something like that?  An email was forwarded
to me and that name was on the forward list and it sounded familiar.  

Any big plans for the weekend?  We're just hanging around Houston.  It seems every weekend for the past year+ we've
been doing some type of house work.  Hopefully one day it will slow.  Talk to you soon.

By the way, did  you see the original manuscript for Jack Kerouac's classic novel of the beat  generation went for $2.2 million?  Maybe Lisa can propose an  appropriate toast at Vesuvio's.

As I watched the Lakers pound that Texas  team?oh yeah, San Antonio, I was thinking about the guy Mr. Ruscitti refers to  as "my boy."  As I'm sure you were  both otherwise occupied, you probably missed my boy in action this  afternoon.  He was on what he  termed a "power walk (catchy, don't you think?)," going door to door with  power-saving light bulbs, which he was handing out free of charge to  "emphasize our need to conserve energy."   Boy, my boy is one powerhouse.   You think we could bottle what he's  got?
