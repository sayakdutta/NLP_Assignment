Attached is a memo that Rick plans to send out - I hope that attaching this 
makes it easy for you to take care of this.  I am delivering to him a 
highlighted copy of the memo so that he will know about a few wording changes 
that I have made since the last time that he saw this in draft form.  He is 
certainly free to make any other changes before it goes out.  Call me with 
any questions.
