1) Y2K Team:  Let me know if you would like to send a notes mail message from 
you to the individuals that were here on Saturday, January 1 for the Y2K 
testing.  I have created an address list that contains those names that I 
could forward to Susan Skarness to use for that purpose.  

2) Draft Memo from Rick Causey:  Attached is a draft memo that Rick Causey 
proposes to send this week that describes a coordination role that I will 
play on certain operational policies and procedures that should be 
coordinated in all trading locations.   I have left you some comments 
regarding this on my voice mail.  I would welcome your comments or 
questions.
