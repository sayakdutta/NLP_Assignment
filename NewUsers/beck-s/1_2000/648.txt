We are wrapping up several hours in the office and have tested all 
commodities front to back.  We found a few minor issues, primarily reports 
with report dates that were incorrect.  The content and underlying 
calculations in the reports were correct.  These were really just query and 
formatting issues.  All were quick fixes of five minutes or less.  So at this 
point we feel confident about our system situation.  More will unfold with 
counterparties next week, but hopefully all found this as uneventful as have 
we.  

Hope your new year's celebration was fun.  We saw pictures of the London 
festivies on TV as we were cooking our New Year's eve dinner last night at 
home.  

See you soon.
