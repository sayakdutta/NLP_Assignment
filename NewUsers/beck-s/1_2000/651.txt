Does the info as provided from HR indicate MBA's from UT?  I know that Enron 
probably has a number of undergrads from UT.  At this point, I am 
specifically interested in UT MBA's, as it is the Houston Chapter of UT's 
Graduate Business Network for which I will now serve on the steering 
committee.  Thanks!  --Sally

Happy New Year, Lisa!  Can you please pull a list of University of Texas 
alumni for me?  I'd appreciate your help.  Thanks!
