Buried somewhere in these e:mail messages is a resume.  Please print for me 
and put it in a resume folder (along with some others that I have in my 
outbox).  I will need to review them when I am back.  Thanks.

Dear Sally,

This person comes as very highly recommended (my husband says she is one of 
the best people he has ever worked with).  Do you have any suggestions on who 
could use her business development skills?

Thanks

Hi Shona, Tandra does look like a good candidate.  We are holding up on our 
open reqs for now, however, will pass onto IT.

This person is an outstanding performer.  My husband indicated that she was 
the highest rated senior in her class, and one of the best people he has ever 
worked with.  She recently left KPMG to work for a start up company, who is 
now going bankrupt.

Please let me know if you are interested.

Thanks

Hi Shona.  Randy told me to send my information.  I'm interested in hearing
about some of the opportunities you have to offer.  Please give me a call if
you have any questions.
