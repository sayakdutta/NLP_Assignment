All eight students that we interviewed for the Enron Scholarship were great and we should actively be sure that we get them on our interview schedules next year when they are in the second year of the MBA program.  I don't want to simply leave that to chance by encouraging them to consider us.  Karen's letter (noted below) is a good idea, but we should augment that by getting these students names on our radar screen for next year.  I will find out who the recruiter is for UT MBA's and I will get copies of the students' resumes and my notes on where they could be a good fit to that recruiter.  --Sally 


I am pleased to announce the recipients of the 2001 University of Texas Enron MBA Excellence Scholarships:

Christopher Cashman 
SooPang Tang 
Holland Brown 

Each student will receive $10,000 in scholarship money based on their essays, interviews and on how they exemplified the vision, values and beliefs of Enron.
I have already notified  the winners, so  please join me in congratulating each one on a job well done.  

Special thanks to everyone who participated in the selection of the winners.   Stay tuned for details on the date and time for the Scholarship Awards dinner slated for early next semester!








FYI... All of the candidates that interviewed were outstanding according to the scholarship interview team (Sally Beck, Andrea Reed, Roger Ondreko and Loftus Fitzwater).  I will be sending each of them a letter to thank them for their participation and encourage them to consider Enron when interviewing for full time opportunities next semester.

Thank you,

Karen Marshall
