Thanks for your message.  I thought that John did have responsibility for 
risk, and I am glad to have that clarified.   Kristin worked for me for 
several years as the risk lead for ENA power and joined Barry at EBS last 
August, so I knew that you all had a great resource there!  

I will look forward to a follow-up conversation to explore where we may have 
potential solutions for EBS that can be borrowed or modified from EWS.  Just 
give me a call when you are ready to get back together.  --Sally 



Thanks for taking the time to meet with me today.  You gave me some valuable 
insights and suggestions.

I do want to correct one misstatement that I made.  John DOES have ownership 
of the risk books.  This area of responsibility is being handle by a lady 
named Kristen Albrecht who reports to Barry Pearce who is in charge of 
trading operations.

I am looking forward to meeting with you again soon.
