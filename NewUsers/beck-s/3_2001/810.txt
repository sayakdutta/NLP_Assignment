Please get with Tina and work out how we will handle expense reimbursements 
for Greg's approval.  If Tina and Greg are not yet using the online format, 
then simply sending him original receipts probably won't do anything for 
him.  Thanks.  --Sally

Please send original receipts for Greg's review.

Thanks,
