FYI - Beth Apollo led the doorstep review in Monterrey last week.  No 
problems discovered - but Beth did find some communications and system access 
issues that could be improved to make it easier for Max's team to do their 
jobs.  She has quickly identified a point person within Operations in Houston 
who is bi-lingual (Gordon).  Max's note addresses his pleasure over Beth's 
responsiveness and the doorstep process in general.  Just wanted to pass this 
along.  --Sally

Beth:

Thanks for the note regarding Gordon.  I appreciate the quick turnaround time 
on it, and I agree that he should be a helpful addition to the team.

Put me down as a fan of the doorstop review process.

Best regards - Max
