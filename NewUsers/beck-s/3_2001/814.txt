I was out of the office Friday and Monday - just back today.  I am having to 
rearrange some things that Mary was focused on.  I will get back with you 
later today and let you know who the best contact person will be.  --Sally 




We should all continue looking for more companies, with whom we can draw 
parallels.  Sally, if you know of others which might be more directly 
related, please let us know.

N.B.  Sally, is there a contact person to discuss the "drilled-down" list of 
potential customers that Mary sent us?  Her Asst. said that Mary might be out 
for a few days.
