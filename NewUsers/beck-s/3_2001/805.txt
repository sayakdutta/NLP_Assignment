I took the Executive Influence and Impact program in May 1999 and also took 
the follow up Communications program in 2000.  Is this another program that 
you are contacting me about, or would Enron like for us to repeat the 
program?  Hopefully HR records indicate that I completed the two programs in 
1999 and 2000.  Just let me know if I need to sign up for anything.  --Sally 



Sally, attached is participant information and an enrollment form for the 
program. Please let me know when you would like to attend and I would be 
happy to make sure you get a convenient date.

Sessions will be held in Houston on the following dates:
 
 May 14-15
 September 11-12
 November 6-7

Thanks and let me know if you need any additional information.

Ryan
