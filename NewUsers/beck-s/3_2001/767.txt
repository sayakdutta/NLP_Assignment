Big ticket item on here is the group dinner in Dallas for the ASE.  I can 
view the entry and can click on attendees - but only see a list of 10 or 12 
attendees.  There were 30 or so, plus Greg Piper and Lisa Petruska.  I am 
missing a second page of attendees, or were only a few listed?  If I am not 
missing a page, please ask Heather to include the complete list of attendees 
(all who were at the ASE plus Greg and Lisa).  A $4,000 meal for 10 attendees 
looks funny.  There were many more in attendance.  The cost of the meal makes 
more sense with a complete list of attendees.  Thanks.
