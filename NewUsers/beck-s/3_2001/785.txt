Per discussion with RAC management, during the budget approval process RAC's 
initial budget for Doorstep was eliminated.  Consequently, we cannot accept 
any charges from EAS for travel expenses.  

Ted Murphy indicated that Rick Causey stated at the inception of Doorstep 
that Doorstep costs should be charged to the business unit subject to the 
Doorstep visit.  

If you have any other questions, give me a call.

Regards,
Cassandra.
