Did you get the changes that we discussed yesterday included before the 
response to the RFP went to CMS? 

Also, please send me a copy of the complete response to the RFP, assuming you 
have that.  You mentioned yesterday that the document we were reviewing was 
only part of the package.  I would like to see the whole thing.  

Thanks.
