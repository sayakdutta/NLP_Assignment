I won't be able to join Wanda and Juanita in Calgary next week.  I will find 
myself in South America next week, in Sao Paolo and Buenos Aires.  Should be 
interesting, but a long flight.  I am cross referencing my calendar with your 
vacation days, and I will get back with you later today on a suggested date 
for a trip north.
