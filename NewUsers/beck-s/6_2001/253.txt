Please coordinate with Sharron on Rick's schedule and get back with Kristin to set up a meeting. Thanks. --Sally 

 

Hello Rick and Sally,

My name is Kristin Gandy and I wanted to introduce myself.  As you probably already know Lexi Elliott recently passed UT recruiting onto me.  

I was wondering if you both had some time next week to get together.  I would like to formally meet you, as well as discuss Fall recruiting and the strategy Lexi and I have already worked on.  

Regards,

Kristin Gandy
