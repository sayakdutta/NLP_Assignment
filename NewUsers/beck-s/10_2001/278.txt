Will do the best we can.  As ENW, we utilize the Analyst pool much more heavily than the Associates pool.  Several of us from ENW nterviewed Analyst candidates for Fastastic Friday on October 26 (including me).  I believe that we have a number of ENW managers committed to the November 16 Fantastic Friday interviews for Analysts.  

Most Associates rotations are commercial rotations, so it would seem to make sense to have commercial teams heavily involved in the November 3 and December 1 Super Saturdays.  

What would be the time commitment on Saturday?  --Sally 

 

The AA program is in need of interviewers for this weekend.  They could use your assistance in encouraging Managers and above from Net Works to participate.  They are short about 35 interviewers.  

Please forward this info. to those you think might be interested or provide me with names and I will give them the details.  Thanks

In each Decision Meeting we will also track which business units/departments wish to bring a certain candidate into their area.  This will give you the chance to hand-pick your new talent.  Please confirm to me via e-mail the dates your team members will participate.
