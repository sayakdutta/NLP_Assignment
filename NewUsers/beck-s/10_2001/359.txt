We are looking forward to dinner with you and other faculty members on Tuesday, October 16 as we honor the three students who are the recipients of the 2001-2002 Enron MBA Excellence Fund Scholarships.  We have booked The Josephine House once again.  

I wanted to confirm several details with you.  

1)  Cocktails at 7:00 pm; Dinner at 7:30 pm  --Do these times work for you?  

2)  Last year's invitees from UT included the following:








	Would you like to make any changes or additions to this list for the dinner?  If so, please let me know the changes and appropriate e-mail addresses as necessary.  

I will update you later in the week with the list of Enron attendees and the names of the students and their spouses, as applicable.  

I look forward to seeing you again at the dinner.  I have enjoyed being involved in the interview process for selecting the scholarship recipients for the last three years, and I especially appreciate the opportunity for Enron and the University to jointly recognize these deserving students.  Please call me with any questions regarding the dinner.
