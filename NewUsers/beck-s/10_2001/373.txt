Our invitation to all Analysts and Associates to attend our meeting paid off with at least one!  --Sally 

 

Hi Sally,

My name is Luis Bravo, we met about a month ago in an Associates happy hour (I'm the intern who was trying -without success- to meet with you last summer), right now I am an Associate at EES, structuring businesses. 

First of all thanks for inviting us (Associates) to join your meeting. It was a very illustrative as well as an entertaining one -nice video by the way. 

I am writing you because I am very interested in getting to know more about the Risk Management operations at Enron Networks so it would be ideal for me to meet with you to talk about it; however, if not possible in the mean time, I would also appreciate if you could give me some names of people that I could contact to so that I can get acquainted of this side of Enron Networks operations.

Thanks a lot, 

Regards,

Luis Bravo
