Attached is a contact list for Operations, giving home and cell numbers for the Head of Operations for EA, EGM, EIM, EES, EBS and EEL.  Also listed are the lead risk and settlements personnel for each business unit.  My numbers are listed as well, so feel to call me this weekend if needed. 

More detailed contact lists for gas risk, power risk and settlements have been sent to Geoff Storey, as requested by Louise and John.
