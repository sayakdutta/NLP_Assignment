Thanks for your note.  I am wearing my longhorn shirt in the office today so that my affiliation for tomorrow's game is clear!  Let's hope for reveral of last year's score.  

Hope that 2nd year is going well.  I will be in touch in the next few days on details for a dinner with Dean May and the Enron scholarship winners later in October.  --Sally 

 


Hi Sally 
Heard the good news from Lexi when she visited campus. Congrats on your promotion to COO!  Best of luck in your new position.
Take care and remember to root for the Longhorns vs OU tomw.  We're hot this year! 
Warm regards
