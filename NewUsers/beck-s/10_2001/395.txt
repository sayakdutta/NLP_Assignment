Always nice to see positive things.  Thought I'd share this with you.  --Sally 

 

Guys,

Just wanted to send you a note of congratulations, given Q3 EES results  - you are and will continue to be a key and integral component to the success and growth of EES. 

I know there is a lot of heavy lifting and difficult decisions but I do believe we are starting to put a dent in the issues.  At the same time, we are developing a significant franchise of which Enron can be proud.  

Thank you
Dave
