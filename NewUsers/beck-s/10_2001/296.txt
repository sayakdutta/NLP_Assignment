Thanks for finding this!  I have printed it on a color copier, so I will have it with me as an example - am actually pretty close to being finished.  

Had a fun visit with Cara and Anna.  What a cutie Anna is!  And what a good baby - still haven't heard a cry, or at least not one like my kids could produce!  They left after breakfast this morning, while most of us were at church.  Meagan stayed home to work on essays for college applications.  

So sorry to hear about the car wreck.  Glad that you two are okay, but what an inconvenience.  Hope that the other guys insurance covers everything.  --Sally
