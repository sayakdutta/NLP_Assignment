I will be coordinating the efforts around the subject priority identified at the Global Accounting Leadership Conference.  We will be identifying people to help on all five priorities depending on each group's needs and interests.

The elements of the "attract and retain keyemployees" priority include:  

	1.  resource planning and utilization across Global Accounting 
	2.  on-campus and experienced hire recruiting
	3.  career development (effective analyst program for Global Accounting; new hire orientation; career planning, etc)
	4.  performance management (applying the PRC process in Global Accounting; additional forms of rewards and 
	     recognition)
	5.  networking/social activities

1.  Which of these elements, if any, are of particular concern to your group?
2.  Is there a  particular person(s) you would like to assign to one, several or all of these elements?

I anticipate that the time requirements will not be significant (a few hours each week, depending on the number of elements addressed by an individual, with some weeks heavier and some weeks lighter).

Please let me know!  Thanks!
