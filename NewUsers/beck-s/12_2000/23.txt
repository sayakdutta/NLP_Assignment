Well, she declined our kind offer, didn't she?  As busy as life is between 
work and home for me right now, I can't say that it will bother me too much 
to attend a shower where someone else makes the finger sandwiched and punch!  
Do be on the look out for the perfect pack of diaper pins.  I noticed some at 
a rack at Randall's the other day... (Just kidding!)

Hope you all are doing fine.  I was on jury duty three days last week - 
really interesting, but totally screwed up my schedule at work.  I have been 
doing double-time to try to catch up, especially since I plan to be off the 
week of December 18th.
