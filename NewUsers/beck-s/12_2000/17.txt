I hope that you got my reminder message that I was attending Wes Colwell's 
PRC meeting today, which kept me from attending the ENW staff meeting over 
lunch today.  My remaining PRC obligations are as follows:

 Friday, Dec. 8   Energy Operations PRC   8:00 am until ?
      (ENA, EGM, EIM)

 Monday, Dec. 11 `  Enron Wholesale Services PRC  8:00 - 9:30 am

 Wednesday, Dec. 13  Associates       7:30 am until ?

The Enron Americas Management Team Offsite scheduled for Las Vegas December 
13-16 had been cancelled, so I will be in the office all of next week.
