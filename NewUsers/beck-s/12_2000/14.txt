What is the latest on this one?  I gather that they are still using 
spreadsheets, which in and of itself is not necessarily a problem.  Are their 
positions not being captured and aggregated?  What does Scott Mills have to 
say about this?  --Sally

Shona,
When we returned from Argentina we concluded that a proper risk management 
system needed to be implemented in order to posture the office for success. 
They have been trading there for over 2 years which is plenty of time to do 
so.  We used Enpower as a phrase meaning "Proper Risk System".  If there are 
real questions about the functionality of such, then that obviously begs the 
question as to why we allow someone to transact on behalf of Enron 7500 miles 
away that doesn't understand.  That being said Mike Guerrero seems perfectly 
hip to having the best platform available.  It was Enron NetWorks that said 
that they could implement a "controlled spreadsheet environment" that would 
have ALL the functionality of a proper risk system, including risk 
aggregation into RisktRAC, credit aggregation and tracking, option valuation, 
scalability, security and stability. I will not opine on such matters.  They 
must produce or stop transacting.

I believe they have implemented a secure spreadsheet environment in which to 
work.  I know I discussed this during a meeting with Ted and Donna a few 
months ago and we decided we could live with the change to a secure 
environment in lieu of a full EnPower implementation.  Although EnPower would 
be great to have, if commercial decides that the office does not have the 
transaction volume there is not much we can do.  

As I understand it, there are further issues with capturing the appropriate 
curve shift info from these offices in RiskTrac.  Let's discuss what we can 
do and what decisions need to be made.

Thanks

Shona







Since this was a fix to a Doorstep finding, how do we react?

Lavarato has stopped efforts for implementing Enpower in South America until 
business activity increases enough to support it.

Based on below, we will start looking for someone with strong Access/Excel 
knowledge to come up with a different solution.  Everyone will have to 
regroup and determine next steps and look at revised timelines.

I discussed this with John Lavorato who is now responsible for this.  He said 
don't do anything!  When their  volumes increase we can address the Enpower 
implementation again.

Steve,
 Come by my office to discuss.

Richard / Beth,  We have been asked by risk to get Argentina started on 
EnPower.  Are you OK with us moving on this?  A couple things to consider...

Our instance strategy for EnPower is determined by geographic location 
(bandwidth), volumes, and market similarity (functionality).  Based on this, 
I want to set South America up on their own instance.  EnPower will have the 
following instances long term:  EUR, US, CND, SA, AUS, JPN, IND.  We will 
continue to pursue a common code base and logical data model.

There is additional time and cost associated with setting up a new instance, 
however, I am concerned about continuing to pile new business units into a 
production environment that will eventually need to be split.

Glad to discuss...  Please respond quickly, as we are waiting to pull the 
trigger on this...

Steve

Duong,
Per our phone conversation, below is the list of people that would need 
access to EnPower production. 

User Names:   NT ID:  Extension:
Scott Mills   SMills  x3-3548
Martha Stevens  MSteven x3-4742
Sarah Smith   SSmith  x3-0997
Juana Fayette  JFayett  x3-0992
Jana Morse  JMorse  x6-8265
Trang Le  TLe1  x3-6996

Currently, the Argentine Power group has in total about 20 physical forward 
deals  which will be done under Enron Comercializadora De Energia Argentina 
S.A.(Co. 027W) and one financial deal which will be done under Enron North 
America (Co. 0364). Given the fact that we'll also have deals on ENA, I would 
think that we could be on the Houston server. Just let us know.  
In the mean time, we'll be working with the various Global groups to have the 
proper desk, portfolio, facilities etc.... set up.

Thanks for your help,
Trang x3-6996
