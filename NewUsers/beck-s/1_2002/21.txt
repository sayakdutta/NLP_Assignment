The Estate version of the systems were commissioned successfuly onto Estate hardware this weekend with the users completing their testing on sunday, and it looks as though we are in good shape for doing the same for NetCo this week.
 
Just a few weeks ago there was a lot of doubts that it could be done, but thanks to a great display of team work, and just plain hard work, with many late nights (and a few sleep overs....), we met our first major milestone!!!!!
 
Thanks for the outstanding efforts over the last two weeks, that made this weekend possible.
