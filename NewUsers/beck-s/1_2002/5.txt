Great - I  will look forward to seeing you next week.  --Sally 

 

Wes thought it was a good idea so I've changed my flight to go home Tuesday afternoon.  I think it will help me to better understand the new expectations.

 

Don't know what works best with your schedule.  Ernie Pitterelli (head of Operatins for UBS Americas) will be here on Monday and Tuesday and one of the things that we will discuss is the risk roles - position rerporting and calculation of P&L.  Ernie is targeting Tuesday to discuss Canadian operations, so it could be helpful for you to be here.  What was Wes' response?  --Sally

Sally, I was planning on going home tomorrow but Peggy just informed me that she was coming down on Monday and Tuesday to discuss settlements and risk.  Do you think I should plan on being here for that also?
