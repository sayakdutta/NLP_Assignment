Louise:  Who in HR is providing you with a list and what is the purpose of the list?  We can verify that they are still with the company and that they are still getting paid, but knowing the source of the list you refer to from HR and the purpose of the list will allow us to get to the heart of the communication problem.  --Sally

HR gave the list to me - I hope they are still getting paid

Hector and Leslie

 

Larry Joe Hunter, Larry Cash, and Jon Lewis are all still with Enron.

Will you please find out why Louise thinks they are gone.

Thanks
