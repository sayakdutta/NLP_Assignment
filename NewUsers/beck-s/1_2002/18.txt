1)  I believe that Tom Martin is talking with Chris Germany about taking the logistics role for the Texas region with Daren's planned departure.  Please coordinate with Tom and Bob Superty on where they are in this process of replacing Daren.  

2)  I am not sure that I know what database you are referencing.  He is on the current proposed org chart for Netco Energy Operations under Operational Databases (part of the Documentation team).  It is correct that his name is on the list that I provided to you yesterday.  

Let me know if you have any other questions.  --Sally 

 

Sally -

I have 2 questions from the list that you provided this evening.

1.  Daren Farmer is on the list for Gas Logistics.  Jeanie advised that Daren resigned and his last day is Friday.  Need a replacement.

2.  Israel Estrada is on the list for Documentation, however, he is no longer showing in our database.  Do we need to add back?

Thanks again!
Amy
