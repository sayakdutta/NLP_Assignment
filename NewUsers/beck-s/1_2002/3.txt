Sally,
We are trying to track declines and I wanted to make sure I have all the accurate information. I know that we had at least three declines:
Chris Chang
Kelli Little
Sladana Kuclic

I know that we made an offer to Shannon Groenwald(sp) but I am not sure who declined so we could make an offer to her. Please let me know these names. Thanks Sally!
