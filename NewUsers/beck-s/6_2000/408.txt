Our mid year PRC meeting will be held Monday, June 19, at the Doubletree's 
Grainger "B" room.   Please plan to be there to start the meeting at 8:00 AM, 
with a continental breakfast available starting at 7:30.  We will take the 
time necessary to do a good job, but will also try to be time efficient.  
Patti has lunch and snacks ordered, so I would hope to be finished sometime 
in the afternoon.    

I am broadening the Energy Operations PRC committee beyond my direct reports 
to also include all directors in the organization.

I look forward to everyone's participation and will be sending out more 
information later.  Included below are the attendees for the meeting.
