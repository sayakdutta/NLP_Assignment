This reporting tool looks very useful.  I am glad to know that you are 
managing with this on a regular basis.  Do we have a well-defined follow-up 
process to ensure that the outstanding confirms do go out soon?  This is a 
great tool to share with other groups that are doing confirmations.  It would 
be nice to have a standard format that all groups would use to track this.  
Have you shared this with other groups within Energy Operations that are 
doing confirmations?  I would include Global Products as well.  --Sally

Looks good...everyone has done an excellent job in getting this set up and 
monitored.


   
	
	
		


As you can see, these messages are paying off, only 9 deals of 1,262, quite 
an improvement.  Good job Joe!
