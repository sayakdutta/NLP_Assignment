 We have a presentation planned for April 19th at the University of Oklahoma 
for the JC Penney leadership group and the Energy
Management students. We plan on giving a "panel discussion" for the students 
that will be followed by a social event. I would like for all
of you to be on the panel fielding a variety of questions from the group 
regarding Enron. Please look on your calendars and let me know 
your availability as soon as possible so we can book this event. Here is a 
tentative schedule:
  APRIL 19th
  Participant arrival - 3:00pm. ( Location TBD)
  Student arrival- 4:00pm.
  Presentation- 4:00-5:30pm 
  Social- 6:00-8:00pm. ( Cowboy Rodeo)

Thank you and I look forward to hearing from you.
      George Hope
