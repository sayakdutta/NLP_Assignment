Thanks for the update.  I am glad that you and Fernley were able to get 
together.  

Let me know what you hear from Mark or Tim about their discussion.  When that 
is set, I will put out a memo that outlines the changes that we are making as 
Scott Pleus devotes full time to EBS.  

Hope your weekend was a good one.  Have you seen Brent yet?  --Sally 


   
	
	
		


Sally,

I wanted to give you a quick update.

I met with Fernley last Friday and we had a good discussion.  He wanted to 
know my initial assessment of the project and a rough time-line.  I admire 
the fact that he took almost 30 minutes of his time to show his interest in 
this project and myself.  I told him that it would be prudent for me to 
return a month after implementation of the book splits.  This way I can 
ensure that the processes and tools are in place and used by both the traders 
and the support staff.  If Brent needs some assistance at that time, I could 
stay for a 2-week span and meet two needs on one trip.

I spoke to Mark Tawney today and he welcomes my support on the weather desk.  
When I asked Mark about the impact of the traders leaving, he said that they 
are probably trading even more.  Tim Norton is meeting with Mark today and 
assuming things go well, he could began training almost immediately.

I'll try to call you tomorrow,
Todd
