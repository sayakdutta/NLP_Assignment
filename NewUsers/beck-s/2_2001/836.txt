Thanks for your nice note.  The promotion did get the year off to a nice 
start.  I am glad that you were pleased with the year end PRC process.  While 
time-consuming, I have appreciated the opportunity to get to know Associates 
like you whom I would perhaps otherwise not know.  Keep me posted on what you 
are doing.  --Sally 






Sally,  

I just wanted to send a quick congratulatory note on your promotion to 
Managing Director.  And a bit belated, a thank you for serving again as my 
PRC representative.  I was pleased with my outcome at year-end, and once 
again, was one of the few Analysts or Associates who was always kept informed 
about the process.  I appreciate your time and energy in representing me.

Nicole
