Seattle sounds nice.  Haven't made it there myself.  Enjoy the trip.  If you 
have time, I would love to get with you late next week to discuss my thoughts 
about next steps for Joel's team.  --Sally 

Also, when you are back, I would love to set up a meeting with you and some 
of my direct reports so that we can get an update on IT priorities.  We are 
addressing some issues that create operational risk that may require some 
system enhancements to help us mitigate those risks, and we would like the 
opportunity to share those with you in the context of priorities for systems 
work.  












All,

I will be out of the office at a Microsoft CIO Summit in Seattle from Monday, 
February 5 until Wednesday, February 7.  I will be back in the office 
Thursday, February 8.  If you have a problem that requires immediate 
assistance, please call Richard Burchfield at 3-7454.  I can be reached by 
cell phone at 713-501-9622.

Beth
