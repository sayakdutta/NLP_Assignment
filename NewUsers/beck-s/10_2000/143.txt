Thanks for passing along the announcement.  You are right, the grapevine news 
did precede this more formal annoucement!  Sounds as if this will be a fun 
position for you.  Thanks for all of the great work that you have done on 
behalf of mid and back office operations.  Your help in Helsinki earlier this 
year was especially wonderful.  I will call you when I next come to London 
and will hope that you will have time for lunch or dinner to catch up.

The grapevine has probably already reached you, but in case not, here is the 
reason I shall be passing on questions relating to Metals and Strategic 
Initiatives!
