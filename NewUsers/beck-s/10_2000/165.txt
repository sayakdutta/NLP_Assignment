Thanks for asking me.  I enjoyed the opportunity to meet your team and to 
talk with them.  


   
	
	
		


I just wanted to thank you for taking the time to come out and speak at my 
management offsite.   I know you had multiple things going on between travel, 
work and family.  Everyone enjoyed the time away and I think we made some 
positive steps in the right direction.  


Thanks Again,

Scott
