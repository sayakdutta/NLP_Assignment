Glad to hear that we are getting there.  Josephine's House (Jeffery's annex) 
is really good.  They do a great job of serving.  At past Enron dinners, they 
have printed menus specific for the occassion - really nice looking and a 
nice keepsake.  Maybe we can do this.  --Sally 







Heya...

Richard has lunch with dad today.  Richard asked him about the anniversary
thing.  He said he thought with all that was going on a nice dinner rather
than a trip sounded good....I guess we're reaching consensus at last....will
nail down Mom for sure tomorrow night, find out who she wants to invite and
the make the reservations at the Jeffrey's annex place...
