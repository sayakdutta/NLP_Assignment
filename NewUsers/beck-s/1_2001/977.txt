Just wanted to drop you a note to let you know that I will be in the London 
office during the week of January 15.  I will arrive just after lunch on 
Monday and plan to be there through Thursday.  Much of my time will be spent 
with Fernley and Mike Jordan.  

If you have a few minutes while I am in town, it would be great to get with 
you to hear if there is anything that is of particular concern or interest to 
you in supporting the continuing growth of your business in 2001.  I will 
stop by while I am in the office.  --Sally
