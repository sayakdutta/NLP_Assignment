Cathy:  I will be working in the London office during the week of January 15, 
so I will not be at the staff meeting on January 16.  --Sally 






























Just a reminder that the next EGM weekly staff meeting will take place on 
Tuesday, January 16th, from 8:30 - 9:30 a.m., in video conference room EB 
30C1.  Due to the company holiday in observance of Martin Luther King day on 
Monday, January 15th, the staff meeting has changed dates and locations for 
next week only.  The staff meetings will resume their regular schedule on 
Monday, January 22nd, in EB 32C2, and will continue on a weekly basis on 
every Monday at the same time and location unless notified otherwise.  The 
schedule for the next two weeks is as follows:

 Tuesday, January 16th 8:30 - 9:30 a.m.  EB 30C1
 Monday, January 22nd  8:30 - 9:30 a.m.  EB 32C2

Please let me know if you will be unable to attend the meeting on Tuesday, 
January 16th.  Thank you.
