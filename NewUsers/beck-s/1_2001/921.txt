Thanks for the congratulations.  David of course is pleased about the 
promotion but is most anxious to see what dollars come along with it!  
Thanks, too, for your comments on the OpRisk session.  It is always a risk to 
pull together an audience of 90 and deliver something worthwhile.  --Sally

First of all congratulations on your promotion, it is well deserved.  You are 
really in some rarefied air, since there seem to be very few Managing 
Directors.

I also would like to compliment you on putting together one of the best  2 
1/2  hour seminars / workshops that I have ever attended ( I know that is 
saying a mouthful).  The Operational Risk Meeting / Workshop was not only 
informative, but the constantly changing formats kept everyone's attention.   
I believe the meeting also caused a renewed enthusiasm among your supervisory 
personnel.  This is not only my observation, but the feeling of all of the 
people that I have talked to over the past few weeks. 

Once again, congrats.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
