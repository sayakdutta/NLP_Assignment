Thanks for your nice note.  It is always interesting to scan the list and do 
a count of other females names.  Were not too many on this latest list.  We 
will have to work on changing that.  --Sally

Sally,

Congratulations on your promotion to Managing Director.  It is well deserved 
and most appropriate.  In addition,  it always warms my heart when I see a 
woman promoted to the highest rank in our company.  

Best regards, Jean
