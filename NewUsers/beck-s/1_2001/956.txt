Thanks for your nice note.  I certainly follow your career with interest.  

I have been meaning to call to tell you how much we enjoyed getting the 
wedding picture with your Christmas card.  What a great picture - you look 
beautiful and happy.  Meagan and Amanda particularly enjoyed seeing it.  My 
best laid plans for Christmas cards became a limited vision this year - only  
managed to get them in the mail to people outside of Houston.  Maybe next 
year...

I am in your old stomping grounds this week -- London.  I will see Mo 
tomorrow night for dinner and to catch up on her life.  

See you next week!  --Sally
