Thanks for your nice note.  I do hope that everyone on my team sees the 
promotion as recognition of the value of the roles that we perform.  All that 
should make it easier to attract and retain talented people that make my job 
easier and more fun!  

I will ask Patti to schedule some time for us to get together when I am back 
in the office next Monday.  Have a good week.  ---Sally

Congratulations on your promotion to MD!  

In addition to being a great personal achievement,  your promotion helps to 
raise the awareness of the importance of the tasks performed by you and your 
team.  

I look forward to speaking with you upon your return from Europe.

All the best,
