Happy Hour

Please join us for a CommodityLogic Off-site January 17th at Kenneally's

We will be welcoming all the new additions to the team and saying farewell to 
those who have moved off to other projects.  Please plan on attending.  If 
you have any questions, please contact Maria x35586 or Brenda x31914.

See you there!
