I just composed a somewhat lengthy e:mail about the anniversary trip, and 
then closed out Lotus Notes and checked discard changes.  So it is gone - but 
not sent!!  Can you e:mail me back your office phone number and if it is 
convenient for you, I will give you call and use old fashioned technology.
