For now, have her boxes delivered to the spot behind your desk.  I sent Wes a 
message and copied you on that.  I can't remember the name of the person who 
works for Wes that handles moves.   Lisa filled in for her while she was out 
on medical leave.  She is back.  Can you get with her right away and see what 
you can come up with?  Best situation would be for Beth to sit near me.  

Also, Bob Hall has someone who is coordinating space needs for us now that 
Lisa is gone.  Can you check with her, too?  

Also, Jeff Shankman called me last week to ask how we could speed up our 
(Energy Ops) move off of 30.  I don't know who is left on 30.  Can you get 
the person that reports to Bob Hall to give me an update on our moves from 30 
so that I can get back with Jeff this week?  Thanks. --Sally

Sally,

Beth's assistant is wanting to know where Beth will be sitting - where they 
are to ship her boxes.  Any ideas or anything you want me to do regarding 
this?

Hi Patti,

This will probably be the first of many emails in the next couple of weeks.

Do you have a location as to where Beth will be sitting over there?  We'll be 
packing up her boxes soon to ship over and for future post etc.

Also, she will need a new extension number.  She would most definately prefer 
an 853 number and if you can use her VP status to help her get one if they 
refuse (her words) then that would be great.  Her old number was 853-5521 
although someone else may have that now.

Thank you for your help.  It is very much appreciated.

Janine
