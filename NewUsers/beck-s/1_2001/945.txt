Congratulations on the baby - August seems like  a long time away, but given 
how quickly time passes at Enron, you will be there before you know it.  I 
would be glad to visit with you about other opportunities at Enron sometime.  
I am in the London office this week, but will be back in the office the week 
of the 22nd.  Give Patti a call if you would like to get together and visit 
about options.  --Sally 


   
	
	
		


Things are going well...My wife and I are expecting in early August.  Other 
than that I've been busy with my RAC Compliance duties.  I haven't started 
yet, but I am interested in exploring other career opportunities at Enron.  
Any ideas?
