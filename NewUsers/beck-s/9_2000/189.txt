Is this a timeline for all of ENA, or just for the accounting group?

Please note that earnings and headcount templates are due to Consolidations 
on Monday, October 2nd.  Attached is the latest timeline.  Please submit your 
templates to Trey Hardy by then.  Several guidelines or allocation 
calculations (e.g., IT) have not been sent to you because we have not 
received them from Corp. or ENW.  Therefore, we recommend that you use the 
guidelines from 2000.  That should avoid any delays for Monday.

Please forward this to anyone who is participating in the Plan 2001 process.  
Call me if you have any questions (x58694).  Thank you.
