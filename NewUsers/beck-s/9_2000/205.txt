Invitations have been mailed to all VP's and above for the annual Enron 
Management Conference to be held at the Hyatt Hill Country in San Antonio 
November 15-17.  Hopefully, you have received your invitation (more to save 
the date than to provide any detail at this point).  If you have not received 
your invitation, please let me know.
