Diana,

Here's info you requested.  Per our conversation earlier, please try to 
arrange someone with experience/knowledge of Jornada device for training for 
Sally & me both.  Sally is not very technical & will need to be walked thru.  
If she doesn't learn how to properly use it, she will not use it, if you know 
what I mean.  Any help you can give me in setting up training w/ someone that 
will be able to answer our questions is greatly appreciated.  Please have 
person contact me directly as I keep Sally's calendar.  She will be in 
training all day Thursday & Friday, so Monday would be the soonest she is 
available.

I submitted SRRS for "in sync" two or three weeks ago.
Let me know if you need anything else.
