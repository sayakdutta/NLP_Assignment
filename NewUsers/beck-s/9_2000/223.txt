I will be in San Antonio attending an offsite meeting hosted by Rick Causey 
on Wednesday and Thursday, September 13 through 15.  I will leave the offsite 
meeting before its conclusion on Friday, so that I can attend a lunch meeting 
with Philippe Bibi, Rick Buy, Ted Murphy and Bill Bradford to discuss common 
needs around risk systems.  I will be in the office the afternoon of 
September 15.

can be reached.  Key contacts while I am out are listed below:
