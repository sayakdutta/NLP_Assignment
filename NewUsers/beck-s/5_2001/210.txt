Thanks for copying me on this note.  I have sent a suggestion to Sheri and asked her to respond to Frank  Hayden.  --Sally

Help!

It appears that EOL is being given out to people who have not received authorization to trade.  The latest is someone reporting up through Jean Mrha. (John Grass)  Why doesn't RAC require that anyone requesting authorization to get EOL get approved through RAC.  I'm sure Lavo doesn't know (or maybe he does) that we have yet another unauthorized trader to rein in.

Any suggestions?

Frank
