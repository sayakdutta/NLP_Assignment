It was a pleasure to meet you last week when you were in Houston.   You arrived with a some good advance "press" from Cindy, all of which was well founded.  I am glad that your meeting with Tom was fruitful and I am pleased that there may be a fit between Enron's needs and Vivance's offerings.  I know that Cindy is very enthusiastic about the quality product that Viviance delivers, so creating a win-win situation for both companies would be great.  I have e-mailed JIm Martino to keep me posted to the extent there is anything that I can do to help move along the process.  While I won't make the business decision here, I can certainly help to focus attention when needed.  

Let me know when you will be back in Houston.  If you like Mexican food, I can introduce you to the best place in the state for a great meal.  --Sally   

 

Sally,
Sorry it took me so long, but just landed back in New York since last
Monday.  Please accept my sincerest of thanks for fitting Jim and me into
your already hectic schedule. After chatting with Tom Wilbeck, I do believe
that Viviance is the right decision for Enron.  Simply, Tom led us to
believe that a true discovery audit regarding the focus, needs, and delivery
should take place.  We just finished the same for DELL...this has proven to
be quite beneficial, as a study overview does give everyone involved a
better understanding of the right product for a specific company culture.
Just throwing content on a screen doesn't ensure, successful retention.  Our
mission, of education first, enables greater performance in the end.
Hopefully during my next trip down we could take some time for lunch or
dinner.  Your call. All my best, and again, thank you.
Respectfully

Geoffrey Mann
