FYI -

 


Tom/Sally,
The Financial and Power Confirmation team performed testing this morning as well as this afternoon on the ConfirmLogic module.  Testing went extremely well in both cases.  We feel very comfortable with the functionality and display of information contained within the module.  All of our major issues have been resolved.  Therefore, I am comfortable giving my approval that ConfirmLogic is ready for release to the Beta Customers for testing.  Below is a comprehensive list of the current business parameters as well as the business issues to be discussed and resolved during Beta testing.

Negative Confirmation
?If deal status is 'Pending' and current date is 3 business days past the post date; ConfirmLogic changes deal status from 'Pending' to 'Confirmed'.
