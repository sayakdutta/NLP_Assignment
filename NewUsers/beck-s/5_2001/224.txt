Sally,
FYI -- 
Last week, I submitted my resume to Molly Magee for the Director of Global Courterparty position that James Scribner has open within the Energy Operations Global Services Management organization.
It has been a desire of mine for sometime to be a part of your organization, and I look forward to being considered for this or other positions.
Best regards,
Sarabeth Smith
