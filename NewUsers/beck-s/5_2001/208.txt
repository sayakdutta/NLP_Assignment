At the end of my 3:00 meeting with Philippe and Greg today I will get clarification about the international travel.  It is hard for me to believe that Philippe or Beth Perlman or Greg Piper will fly coach to London.  I will keep you posted.  -Sally 

 


I assume this (number 8)  coach class international travel does not apply to doorstep.  We will not get anyone to go to these places if so.

Also, what about London travel?
