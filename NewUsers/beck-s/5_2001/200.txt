Industrial Markets (led by Bruce Garner in Europe and Jeff McMahon worldwide) is expecting significant growth this year.  

Jeff and Bruce expect that by year end, they will have approximately 45 commercial people in Europe and will need significant support for their efforts.

This is a very exciting new business area for us in Europe and we need to ensure that they have sufficient resource dedicated to help them in their efforts.  Could each of you sit down with Bruce and agree the resource which will be dedicated to his group.  As a base proposition, all resources should be sourced out of Europe and each group must have at least one person who is accountable to Bruce for support.  Costs will be re-charged in the normal way.

Please let Jeff and I know what is agreed and call me if there are any difficulties.

Thanks.

Michael
