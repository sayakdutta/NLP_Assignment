Thanks for the details on the flowers.  That should be enough for us to produce something pretty and nostalgic for a coursage and boutineer.  

David must have had a brain lapse - he forgot to mention that you had called.  Meagan and I were probably at the Bearkadette officers meeting at the time.  

We really enjoyed your visit as well!  Thanks for supporting Amanda in her musical efforts.  --Sally   

 

Sally, I called last night and talked to David briefly, as I was going to  
give you the information on Dad's and my flowers in our wedding.  We think  
that Dad had a red carnation in his lapel-no color, so that is what we  
guessed.  Here is the description of my bouquet.  "She carried a formal  
bouquet of white orchids  encircled with lillies of the valley with tiny  
satin ribbon showers."  Primarily one sees the baby orchids iin the black and  
white picture. 
We surely had enjoyed our visit with all of you. 
Love, 
Mom
