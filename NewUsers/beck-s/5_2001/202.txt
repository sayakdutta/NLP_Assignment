Let's try this one?..    Sally, can you please approve this for Brent. He need his log on passwords to approve online?. Thank you 

					For approval please send an email to SAP Security approving this attachment? 

 

Dear Ms. Villanueva,

Your iBuyit Security Request Form arrived with no roles, such as 'Employee' or 'Approver,'  checked. Unfortunately, we are unable to begin processing Mr. Price's request until we receive a copy of the iBuyit Security.doc with his choices noted in the appropriate check boxes. Please, resubmit the form with the desired  choices checked. 

Furthermore, to facillitate the rapid and smooth processing of this Security Request Form, you should be aware that those requesting the user role of "Approver" must have their supervisor email the request to us AND that the Supervisor must state, in the body of the email, that the request is appoved.

Thanks,
Karen
SAP Security






Brent has just been asked to approve on Ibuyit and we have not requested passwords,  can this be processed quickly. We're not sure of the timing on the return for the request currently out there for Brent.  Please let me know as soon as we can get a password for him.  Thank you so much  << File: brentibuyitsecurity.doc >>
