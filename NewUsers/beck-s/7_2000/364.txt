I will be hosting a cookout at my home for OU summer interns, recently hired 
OU grads and the OU recruiting team on Sunday, July 30th in the late 
afternoon.  More details will follow soon, but I wanted to let you know the 
date so that you can hold this on your calendar.  

I will look forward to hopefully seeing all of you there.  And my husband 
will be glad to be surrounded by many fellow Sooners!
