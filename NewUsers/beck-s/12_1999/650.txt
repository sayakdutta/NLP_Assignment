I know that over the past few weeks you have been handling your daily 
responsibilities and working on the transition of business from our 
aquisition of CES's wholesale business.  I realize that balancing all of this 
has been demanding, especially with the holidays, bid week and other end of 
year actitivies.  Thank you for the extra effort that you have given to 
effectively absorb the CES book of business.  It is noticed and appreciated.  

As we look forward to the new year, I thank you for your accomplishments and 
contributions in 1999.  It was a challenging and rewarding year for ENA and 
Energy Operations.  I hope that each one of you enjoys the New Year's 
celebration.  I look forward to all that will be accomplished by working 
together in 2000.
