I have attached the e-mail that Ron Nolte sent to the Deal Clearing user 
community regarding the meeting
that is scheduled for November 16-17.   Please note that this is a meeting 
organized by the IT community, not
the user community.

As you may remember, Stephen Schwarz organized a similar meeting last fall in 
order to provide the IT group
with an agenda of what projects the user community considered to be priority 
projects.  However, the arrival of
EOL greatly altered the IT resources available to concentrate on those 
priority projects.  Today, the deal 
clearing community is struggling to get IT resources due to new systems such 
as ClickPaper.com, Commodity
Logic, project Thunderball  and a new weather capture and confirmation 
system.  This has created some internal 
conflict since each user group supported by the IT deal clearing applications 
group is requesting that their projects 
be set as the top priority project.  

This is a quick outline of the challenges facing both the deal clearing user 
community and the IT group supporting
this group.  I would be happy to discuss any questions you have about either 
the meeting or these challenges.

The  emergence of web trading has important implications for deal clearing.  
Meetings are scheduled for November 16-17 to discuss
these implications and to come to a consensus on a strategic solution for 
deal clearing.  

Please plan to attend or designate someone who can represent you.

Attached please find a tentative schedule for the meetings.

Additional information will follow.

Please feel free to address any questions you might have  regarding these 
meetings to  Sarita Das ( 713 345-8232 ) or Ron Nolte ( 713 853-7569 ).
