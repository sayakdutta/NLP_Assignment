I had to report for jury duty today (along with 500 others from Harris  
County), and to my surprise I was selected to be a juror in a felony case.  
The case will continue on Wednesday, so our scheduled time for a conference 
call may not work.  I will try to reach you from my car while I am on my way 
in for jury duty - probably around 8:30 or 9:00 Houston time.
