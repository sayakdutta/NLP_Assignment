Just a reminder we will have the initial meeting of the ENA/ AA Roundtable on 
Friday at 9:00am in room EB30C1.  Again, the agenda is as follows:

Discussion of PRC
Immediate and future AA needs by business unit
Skill shortages
Campus and off-cycle recruitment
Mottom 10% management
Projecting AA needs from core schools for Summer 2001 intake
Existing talent in specialist roles who should be in AA Program
Ideas/suggestions on how we improve the Program/ENA retention

Your groups need to be represented and if you can't attend please send 
someone to represent you.  Those of you out of town need to call me if you 
have any input.    Thanks again for all your support.  Ted
