Thanks for the update on Dad.  Keep me posted on what you hear.  No, I didn't 
get the message that Cara had called.  With almost two teenagers in the 
house, my personal messages fall very far down the list in importance!  I 
will e:mail her today and maybe we can talk tonight if she can't talk from 
work.  --Sally  







Did you get the message the Cara called you yesterday?  I THINK SHE HAS
SOMETHING SHE WANT TO TELL YOU...

Delved a little bit into the Dad health issue.  Apparently he's still not
feeling too well--very fatigued, diahrea (sp?), not gaining weight, etc.
plus the voice thing.  He went to the dr on Friday--I don't think they know
exactly what to do...Cara and I have suggested a nutritionist but, you know,
Mother knows nutrition so I guess that is not needed....

I don't think Dad looks very good but I don't think he has for a while....
