I can't shed any light on the topic choice.  Surely you can redirect the 
topic.   Brent may have more info. --Sally

Dear Rick:

As you may know, I have recently assumed the duties of PPA/MPA Director at
The University of Texas at Austin. In my new capacity, I shall be
responsible for the 2000 Fall Lyceum Series, scheduled by my predecessor,
Dr. Don Tidrick.

I understand that you will be addressing our 4th Year PPA students on
"Global Equity Markets" in the Lyceum on Wednesday, November 1, from 5:00
to 6:30 p.m. (approximately), in UTC 2.102A. Both the students and I are
looking forward to your presentation.

In advance of the presentation, could you provide me with a brief biography
for introduction purposes?

If you have any questions concerning the Lyceum, or if I can facilitate
your Lyceum presentation in any way, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Very truly yours,

Richard J. Joseph, Director
