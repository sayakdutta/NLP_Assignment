Can you help me on this?  Can you give me the name of someone who sends 

I tried to e:mail back to get some clarification, I got a message that said 
my e:mail was undeliverable.  No contact name, no phone number, and no 
ability to e:mail back.  I'm stuck!!  Thanks.  --Sally

Is there a person who can attach a name and number to this request?  I 
receive many requests daily and I have yet to see any two alike.  Makes it 
tough on someone to act on these, especially when sent without a name or 
contact number if there is a question.   When I click on the address included 
in this message, someone else's name comes up (Steve Beck).  I don't know who 
you are, what you want me to do, or if you even have the right person.
