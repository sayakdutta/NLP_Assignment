Sally, 
In answer to your question regarding the approval process for sign on 
bonuses, Sheila Walton informed me of the following. 
If you are primarily in agreement regarding a small sign on bonus award,  
then no further approval process is necessary.     If the sign on bonus 
amount is substantial then approval from David Oxley is advisable.   
In our current case, a $5,000.00 sign on for a Sr. Specialist would not 
require additional approval except your own.   
I will continue to monitor sign on bonus offers and provide you with a 
recommendation based on all available factors.
