Thanks for the info on the recruiting expo.  Sounds like fun, but I won't be 
able to make it.  I am taking the day off on Friday, April 13th to take 
Meagan for her info session and tour at UT.  We will be driving to Austin 
after she gets out of school on Thursday afternoon, April 12.  

You know that you can count me in already as a team member!  --Sally
