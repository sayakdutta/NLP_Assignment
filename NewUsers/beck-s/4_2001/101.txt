This is the note that I mentioned that I sent to Philippe today about space in the new building.  You can take up the cause with Philippe when he returns.  I am meeting with Tammy Shepperd at 1:30 tomorrow on some space planning details.  I will tell her that Sheri's group should be located with yours, and by that time I should be able to tell her that Sheri's group will be reporting to you.  

I will call you tomorrow after I talk with Sheri - should be by 11:00 am.  --Sally

According to Tammy Shepperd who is very involved in space allocation for the new building, a location for Sheri Thomas' Product Control Group remains up in the air.  Sheri, Andy Zipper, John Cummings, and Surresh have met to discuss space, and all agree that Sheri's group needs to be located with their groups.  My understanding is that you have designated a certain number of spaces for ENW on the trading floors, but that Sheri's group is not included in that count.  Can we get together when you return to the office next week and discuss floor space?  Thanks.  --Sally
