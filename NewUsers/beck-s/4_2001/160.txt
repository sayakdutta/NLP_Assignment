Thanks for your note and resume.  I have sent a copy to our Managing Director of Global Financial Trading.  He is in our London office this week, with a pretty demanding schedule, so it may be early next week before I hear back from him with regard to his interest.  I look forward to talking with you tomorrow.  Best time to reach me would be around 2:00 pm.  --Sally 







Dear Sally,

Thank you for agreeing to review my resume and qualifications for a position
at Enron.  Your company has a fine reputation for innovation and growth.
I will call you Tuesday afternoon concerning any questions we both may have
and to arrange an interview if we deem it is appropriate at that time.
I appreciate you consideration and look forward to meeting you.

Sincerely,
Matt Moses
