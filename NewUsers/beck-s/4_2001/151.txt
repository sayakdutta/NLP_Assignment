Sally has arranged Brian Wood with Avistar to demo a desktop video conferencing product tomorrow (Wednesday), April 4, 1:00 -2:00 PM.  Brian will meet at Sally's office and take whoever is interested to another office location in the Enron Building for demonstration.  If you are interested in attending, please call me at x39106 so I can give Brian a headcount.

Thanks,
Patti x39106
