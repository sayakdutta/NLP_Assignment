Thanks for your note.  I am glad that you liked the pictures.  We would love to have you here for the recital and to spend the night.  If you thought it would work, you could come over on Monday night and we could enjoy dinner together.  I could take the day off from work on Tuesday and we could do some fun things, before what would probably be a more rushed dinner Tuesday night before heading to Amanda's recital.  Then you could make your drive back on Wednesday after breakfast.  
Whatever works for you will be great, though.  

I am heading to Los Angeles tomorrow for the National Charity League National meeting.  Patti is sending you my flight and hotel info.  My Thursday night is open, and I will be getting with Sue that night.  She lives in Whittier, so not too far for her to come and pick me up.  I know that we will have a good time catching up. 

 

Sally, thanks so much for your mailing-the pictures were wonderful especially  
good and really like the one of the three of you,  David, and Meagan!   
Dad and I feel that driving over for the Mother's Day brunch and then staying  
for the recital would be too long.  You are always so gracious about inviting  
us to your special events 
1.  However, we are making plans to drive over for the recital and spend the  
night then, if that would be all right?  Still comtemplating about the  
baseball game- I know it would be quite a wonderul experience to see the new  
field.  Will let you know soon. 
Love,   
Mom.
