Rahil is working with me on a presentation that covers what our services are, the creation of a pricing desk, how that will work (process and revenue sharing), selling of services for others, our operations pricing model, the DASH process, key contacts in operations, etc.  I expect to review a draft by this Friday.  Tomorrow we will have the date set for such a meeting.  We are checking travel schedules for Laura Luce and Max Y. to see if we can catch both in Houston sometime next week.  Greg Piper suggests a meeting with all origination heads at once (a mini offsite).  We will do that if we can set a date that works for a majority.  If that doesn't work, we will simply do one-on-ones over the next ten days to get everyone.  Targeted attendees are:

Gas			Frank Vickers (East)
			Laura Luce (Central)
			Barry Tycholiz (West)

Derivatives		Fred LaGrasta

Power		Dave Duran
			Ozzie Pagan
			Ed Baughman
			Bruce Shuckley 

Portland		Chris Calger

Calgary		Ladain

Mexico		Max Y. 

When you and I met we discussed most of these names.  I added the Calgary guy and Max.  I also want to share this info with Bob Shults and his EOL marketing team.  They talk with a lot of customers and may have the opportunity to bring up our services as well.  We have spent some time with Jean Mrha and John Grass, and will share the presentation with them as well.  

Do you want to add any names?   If we do wind up with one date that will work for most, I will let you know that tomorrow so that you can attend if you would like.  --Sally

Weren't we supposed to be having a meeting on costs of back office services with the Heads of Origination?  Are we close to having this?

Thanks
