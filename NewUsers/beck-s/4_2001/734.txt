I didn't read through all of the names, but wanted to make sure that we are 
including Beth Apollo on invites to participate in recruiting.  I think that 
I mentioned her to you.  She is a VP who joined my team in January after 
spending four years in Enron's London office.  She graduated from Trinity and 
worked in public accounting before coming to Enron.  She would be great to 
have on a team.  I would love for her to join us at UT, but if she has 
another preference that is great, too.  If she is not on your list yet, why 
don't you call her for an introduction and give her the rundown on the 
schools that you are responsible for so that she can make a choice.  Thanks.
