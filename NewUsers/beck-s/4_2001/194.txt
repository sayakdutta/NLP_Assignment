I always like to heart good news.  I can't say that I have been deluged with examples since that meeting in January.  I will ask Patti to set up a meeting sometime this week for us to get together.  --Sally 

 

As you closed the Operational Risk Meeting you asked us to inform you of good news.  Therefore, I would like to meet with you for about 30 minutes to give you a brief update on the expanding role of Global Rates Services.  I gave both Beth and James this brief presentation and would like to share it with you, when you get a few minutes in your hectic schedule.

Please let me know when you get a few moments.
