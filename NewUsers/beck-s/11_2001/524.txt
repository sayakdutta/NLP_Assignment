FYI - response after my call to Brian.  Agreement refers to employees of Enron Americas or its subsidiaries, and those employees involved in natural gas specifically.  Enron Networks is not named, but is definitely an oversight because so much of the support for gas comes from Enron Networks.  Close date on the sale was May 31, 2001 - 12 month non-solicit period starts from that point.  --Sally 

 

Sally - I asked Anne Koehler to give you a call - I think the non-solicit period is for one year.  The tricky bit is that we can't prevent our employees approaching AEP for  job ( or responding to AEP advertisements for a job).
