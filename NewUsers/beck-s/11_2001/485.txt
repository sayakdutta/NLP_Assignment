Spoke to Allen - this outage will not take place this weekend and is tentatively rescheduled for the weekend of November 17.  The feasibility of that timing will be re-evaluated at the end of next week.  --Sally

Webb called me and said he thought SAP was being taken down this weekend for maintenance or something?  Can you call Allen Sommer and ask?  Is this a good thing to do at this time considering we might need to use it?
 
Thanks.
