I will be in the office on Tuesday next week (November 21), but hope to take the day off on Wednesday.  The kids will be out of school on Wednesday and we are going to Austin to be with my family for Thanksgiving.  So we hope to be on the road on Wednesday morning to beat some of the traffic.  

With that, sounds as if it would be better for us to get together on Monday, November 26.  

If you want to try and talk before then, a good time to get me is in car during my morning commute.  Number is 713-417-1591, and some range between 7:00 am and 8:30 am might work.  

These are certainly trying times.  You have been in my thoughts, and you have my commitment that it is certainly not out of sight, out of mind.
