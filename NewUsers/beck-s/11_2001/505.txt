As discussed yesterday, we will have a 5:00 pm meeting daily to update you on details regarding the merger.   We will begin this meeting today, Novmeber 13, and will continue this as long as you find it useful.  The meeting will be held each day in ECS 04075 (same conference room that we were in on Monday morning).  

Mark Taylor will join us from Legal this afternoon. He will discuss terms of the merger agreement and will answer questions that you may have.  We will also discuss our ENW plans for a PRC "Lite".   

There is no need to RSVP to this meeting each day.  The meeting will be held daily for all of those who can attend.
