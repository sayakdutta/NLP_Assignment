Sorry that we didn't get together today.  I plan to be out of the office from now until  Monday, December 31.  I will be in Houston through Christmas, and can be available by cell phone on Thursday and Friday this week, December 20 and 21.  I will be in New York for several days following Christmas, from December 26 through December 28.  

Tomorrow, I will send you a contact list for Mid and Back Office Operations for the remainder of this week and the week of Christmas.  That contact list contains my hotel number in New York, if something critical were to arise while I am out of the office.  

I had provided you yesterday with a list of IT and Operations personnel to be included in the meeting to be set with Elizabeth Saeger regarding the process for handling terminations of transactions and arriving at the residual value of deals non-terminated deals in the risk books.  I have not seen a meeting scheduled yet, and as you can see from the memo that I sent you yesterday, many risk book administrators will begin their vacations around Christmas this week.  If you still plan to hold the meeting this week, please notify my assistant, Christina Valdez (x39106) and I will try to join in by phone.  

I hope that you and your family have a great Christmas.  I will see you back in the office on December 31. Feel free to call me in the interim either at home or on my cell phone.  --Sally
