Thanks for your voicemail - here is the final ERCOT Agreement. I'm still 
thinking of responding w more legal comments but at this point I think the 
door is pretty much shut.

To All TMOS Subcommittee Members:

    Attached are two versions of the Agreement, one red-lined and one
not.  Please review closely and contact me with typos by June 3rd.  Any
substantive changes please forward to this entire e-mail group to review
by June 3rd.  The next TMOS meeting is schedule for June 10, 1999,
therefore, we need to have final changes decided by June 8, 1999.

    Thanks to all of you who have put in exhausting hours of negotiation
and debate to create this final agreement.  It has been my pleasure to
work with all of you.
