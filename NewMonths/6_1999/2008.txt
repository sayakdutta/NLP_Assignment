How about this Friday ? Julie has not left yet. She was 2 days away from 
leaving to start school on June 7th when she, quite by accident, looked at 
the school schedule for the first time in several  weeks. Now mind you she 
had lined up a babysitter ,lined up a place to stay, arranged to get a 
key----to start the 7th. The schedule says the school starts the 14th. Pretty 
funny. How many years will it take her to live this down?.
