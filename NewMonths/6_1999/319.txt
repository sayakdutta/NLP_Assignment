I don't know why any of my time would be charged in this way.  Maybe if you 
can give me a little more detail I could help.







I would appreciate your comments.  We are reviewing costs following the 
Africa reorg, and in preparation for the QBR.

Thanks!
Ken

April payroll records show that you charged time to J3025 - Benin (Africa - 
Sean Long's Group).  Would you please confirm whether this is the correct 
project?  If these hours need to be moved to another project, we can make the 
transfer if you provide us with the project code.

Thank you,
Ken
