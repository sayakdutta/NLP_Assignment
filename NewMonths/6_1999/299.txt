Yes, we would like to use the PowerPoint presentation.  Sorry for the last 
minute request.  If it's a big problem, I might be able to get our graphics 
dept. to turn it into 35mm slides.

Dear Mark,

Kevin had indicated that he would like to use an overhead projector but if
you would like to have a LCD panel for a PowerPoint Presentation, just let
me know so I can make quick arrangements.

Thanks.
Alison
