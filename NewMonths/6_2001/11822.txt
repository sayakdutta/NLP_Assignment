I appreciate the efforts, but I have questions about whether Enron's presence 
does more harm than it does good.  I don't think that we want to give Wood 
and/or Brown a soap box to stand on by showing our face there.  Others may 
have a different view of it, but I think that it needs to be consumers, 
consumers, consumers.  Thoughts?

Best,
Jeff

The California Chamber of Commerce received a call from someone at the
CPUC who requested that they send as many customers as possible to
testify at Tuesday's hearing in favor of direct access.   The Chamber
has requested the same thing of Enron.
