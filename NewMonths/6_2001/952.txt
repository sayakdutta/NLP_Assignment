You caught that.  I guess that's fair.   We would likely leave around 1:00 pm CPT which would put us in Portland at 2:30 (West time).

Does this work?

 

what if we did a loop so that we split the flying pain.

houston to portland	east traders
portland to cabo		east traders and west traders
cabo to houston		east traders and west traders
houston to portland	west traders

 

I talked with Lavo and we agreed Herndon and Black should go as well.   I think Zufferli would make 14, but we should be able to squeeze.

I am calling aviation today and I plan on arranging the following:

	1) Plane goes to Portland and picks up your guys at 9:00 am on Friday 6/21 (or 6/28 if more notice is required)
	2) Plane picks up Houston guys at approx. 3:30-4:00 pm (Houston time)
	3) We arrive in Cabo around 7:00 pm.
	4) Plane returns to Houston 6:00 pm Sunday
	5) Plane continues to Portland and arrives around 8:00 pm (Portland time)

Let me know if this works for you guys.
	

 

should he be on the trip?  we could make him fly to portland.  to ease the travel he could spend a day or two working out of our office.
