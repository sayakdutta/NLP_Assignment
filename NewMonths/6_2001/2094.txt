Please review and provide comments and feedback by the end of the week (note: Ted and David, we have a conference call scheduled Wednesday for the three of us to discuss).   Also, I'm sending to Price Waterhouse Coopers for their input as well - I need to spend more time reviewing what they sent on Friday to see if I've missed any issues we want to address.

I have not reviewed the details or the (one-RAC) structure with any of the other RAC or risk management functions - please do not distribute yourselves as I'd like to "cushion" the reception. 

Review meetings with these functions begins tomorrow (Tuesday), when I meet with:
?	Dave Gorte,
?	Bill Bradford and Molly Harris
?	Sally Beck's group (Beth Apollo and James New)
?	Treasury (Perkins and later, Despain)
?	Internal Audit (Kilchrist)
?	Legal (Sayre/Taylor)

I'll wait to hear from David/Ted tomorrow morning as to whether I should provide a complete draft to any of these other functions or to Rick Buy at this point, or if I should wait until later in the week when we've all had the opportunity to review.  

As I turn around the next draft, I'll work on a power point presentation for use in the executive meetings beginning the last week of June (Business Unit Offices of the Chairman, Whalley, Causey, Fastow, Skilling).  I made a quick summary of changes in the document attached below; going forward I will refine this and perhaps red-line the current policy to assist our detailed review.  


Thanks for your help,

Cassandra.
