I need a couple of CA for the following information.  The need to be bilateral agreements.  Please use the bi-lateral form, that you and I have used before.  The Enron entity is Enron Compression Services Company.  Ned will be sending a more detailed scope shortly and I will forward. Please come to me with any questions.

 

Per my previous voice mail, could you please prepare CA's for both:  Anadarko Petroleum Corporation,  1200 Timberloch Place, The Woodlands, TX  77251 and Duke Energy Field Services,  5718 Westheimer, Ste 2000, Houston, TX 77057. As mentioned both CA's are for the purposes of data sharing relative to Elec. compression projects.
