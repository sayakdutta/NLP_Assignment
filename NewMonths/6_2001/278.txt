Attached please find comments on the Illinois Energy Workshop.  I have reviewed Pam Stroebel's comments which were basically in support of the development of more generation .  She commented that Illinois' reserve margins are adequate over the next few years.  Interestingly, she claims that Com Ed has one of the largest curtailable programs in the country.  She has industrial customers representing 1200 Mw of Capacity under contract.
