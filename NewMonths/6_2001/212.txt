You probably already have this but just in case.....

 


Mark,
 
Thanks for your help & patience today.  I am providing the names, phone numbers and fax numbers of Knauf's attorneys.
 
Jack Reese
Phone:  530.241.1611  
Fax:  530.741.5106
 
Barry McCarthy
Phone:  408.558.0950
Fax:  408.558.0955
 
I provided these gentlemen with your name and number at 9 am PST this morning.  At 3:30 pm, they informed me that they have yet to receive all of the documents.
 
They have asked for:
 
1.  ISDA Master Agreement (Carol St. Claire faxed this to Knauf on Friday) which they have not received from Knauf.  They do have the Schedule to the Master Agreement, Attachment 1 (Legal Opinion), Paragraph 13, Exhibit A to Paragraph 13 of Annex A, Letter of Credit Format (Schedule 1), and Exhibit A - form of Enron guaranty.
2.  Form of the Confirmation Agreement.
 
Sorry about the short timeframe, but I appreciate your help.
 
Thanks,
 
Laird
