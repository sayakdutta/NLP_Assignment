The NRB ruling has not come down yet BUT the Union President has received a phone call from the National Labor Relations Board (NRB) and they will be ruling in favor of the Union, forcing Midwest to the negotiation table.
Midwest has been notified of this and are attempting to call for a special meeting with the NRB to be released from the negotiations.
At that time, the NRB is prepared to have a judge require that Midwest to come to the table.
If Midwest comes to the table but is not willing to negotiate, Labor 15 will proceed with a strike.  At this time, it is estimated the strike will take a week to implement after a strike decision is made.  This is due to the newly formed Labor 15 and its disorganization.
