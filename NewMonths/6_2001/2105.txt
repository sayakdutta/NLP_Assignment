Molly, Thanks.

I shall join you. I assume it's Ninfa's on West Dallas.

Vince

 

You are invited to Ninfa's next Wednesday, June 20, at 5:00 pm to say
Farewell and Good Luck to Lou Casari 
as he leaves Enron to pursue other opportunities

Feel free to forward this to anyone omitted from this distribution inadvertently.

Thanks.
