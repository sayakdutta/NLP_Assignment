Judy,  Attached is the draft confirm for EEX.  Can you fill in all the notice information for EEX.  Also as we discussed, we also need to insert the well/field/lease data.  Note that there is no MDQ.  From the printout, it looked as though all volumes in excess of 1700 MMBtu per day were priced as gas daily.  If there is an MDQ, we will need to insert it.  Thanks.
