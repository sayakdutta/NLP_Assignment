You still interested in going to the Firehouse on tomorrow night?  I just checked my messages at home and Bryan called last night...at 9:45!  I was already passed out.  I know I'm an old bitty, but that is just too late to be calling a working girl when you're looking for a date Wednesday or Thursday night.  Anyway, I will give him a call this afternoon but I might suggest we just do something when he gets back from his trip.  I talked to Katy last night (before he'd called) and told her about the firehouse...she's definitely interested.  Let me know what you think.

That would have taken my mind off some other person whose name I won't mention.
