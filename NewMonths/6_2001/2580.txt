Eric:

Am in the process of arranging your Shanghai leg of the journey. Will set up

a package that allows you to choose meals. I think you should have a little
guidance in your explorations of the Shanghai area. Shanghai is a friggin
mad-house (16 million people) and if you ain't got the language skills
they will bend you over a rickshaw and ride you like a poodle. So- let me
set up your hotel and sightseeing for you. You can break loose from the
"tour group" vibe later in Qingdao. Keep in mind that you'll be in a
relatively small group (ie. it won't be a Greyhound bus packed full of
gawking blue-hairs). I'll send full Shanghai details when the biz is
finished later today...

In regards to the Beijing leg, we altered the itinerary to suit our needs.
We knocked out the bullshit and kept the bliss nuggets. You should have a
traditional Beijing roast duck dinner (it rocks!) and you should experience
Beijing Opera at least once in your life. We'll see the Beijing Opera in a
famous Beijing teahouse while sucking tea and brews and nibbling on pickled
chicken feet and other assorted delicacies. We knocked out the full two-hour

Beijing Opera performance that would have been later in the week. We'll be
staying in a Wangfujing hotel. Wangfujing is the trendy shopping street in
downtown Beijing; should make the wives happy. It'll be $70 USD/night.

Will send full Beijing details when we've finished the haggling and cheating

rituals that make life so wonderful in the middle kingdom.

Take care, guyeee.

Love,

Jon
