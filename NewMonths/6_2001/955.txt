Sounds OK for now.   Long term, your portfolio manager should know how to value options.

 

Mr. Presto,
Your current fee is 1%. I called the PaineWebber online services. There is
no way to make the system reflect the fact that your NQ stock options don't
go below zero. I did create 2 new portfolios for you though. So now we have
the following:

Presto-ENRON: Lists all stock options along with their gain/loss(first on we
created)
Presto-Enron Restricted: Lists only your restricted shares
Presto-Enron3: Lists only those options that have a value greater than zero.
This portfolio, I can update monthly for you, or as often as you wish. This
is, I feel, the way that will give us the truest overall value of your stock
options, and it will also help us focus on the in the money options for
exercise purposes.

Please let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Hank Emery




Thanks.

   Will do. Let me figure something out for the online portfolio. The only
   problems we have for the online portfolio are that it is pretty limited
   in
   our parameters. We'll figure something out though.

   Thanks,

   I think you forgot the cash position.  I would rather have on-line
   valuation, even if the $'s aren't perfect.   I like to look at my
   personal
   equity portfolio (includes Enron hedging) separate from Enron granted
   stock
   and option value.

   One portfolio is liquid and the other is not and I monitor differently.

      Mr. Presto,
      Why don't I just do this for you on a monthly basis? Please see
   attached
      PDF
      Acrobat file. Please let me know if you have trouble opening it.

      Thanks,
      Hank Emery




      
                        

      Thanks.

         Mr. Presto,
         I'll work on some things. let me play with it for awhile and I'll
   see
         what
         we can figure out.

         Thanks,
         Hank Emery


         
                                    

         Except it can't be negative because they were grants at no cost to
      me.
         The problem is the combination of restricted stock which is total
      market
         value and options which is gain/loss need to be added together to
   get
         total
         portfolio value.

         I was hoping you could trick the system so portfolio value was
      accurate.

            Mr. Presto,
            That is true, I was wondering if we shouldn't just figure that
   the
            Gain/Loss(Difference between the current market value and the
   cost
            basis)
            represents the actual value of the stock option portfolio. Does
      that
            make
            sense?

            Thanks,
            Hank Emery

            
                                                

            The options are not valued properly.   The market value is
      calculated
            based upon the value of the underlying, which grossly
   overstates
      the
            market value of the portfolio.  The restricted stock (basis of
   $0)
      is
            valued OK, but the options are not.

            In addition, the year restricted stock and option grant is not
   yet
      in
            the portfolio.
