Please have Grace (or her replacement begin including NYMEX coal, PRB 8800 Coal, Resid 1% and Resid 3% in the curve handout everyday.

Thanks.

 

 

I didnt know you didnt have access. I just sent the crude and products models. You can use crude to rpce resid options. Just override the swap price with the resid crack. Paul Broderick is very familiar with all these models.
Attached in this message is curvefetch. It reaches into ERMS for all NG, Crude and products curves. Book codes are included. If you have trouble with any of these let me know.
Im loking forward to getting access to the power model.
Thanks
Jen
 

As soon as I get access to crude, resid, & coal curves, I will grant access to power curves.

Thanks.

As we work to improve to our fundamentals, one of things we'd like to include is off-peak prices. We have a weekly production / burn report . Can I have acess to these prices? Who should I contact?
Also can i have access to the power structuring model and curves?
Thanks
