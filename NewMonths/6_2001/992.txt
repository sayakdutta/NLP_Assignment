Joe will get promoted at year-end.   Associates are not eligible until 18 months of service.   We placed Joe in Superior.

Kim -

Have we looked at associate rankings yet?  I was wondering how Joe fared and what the policy is on promoting individuals out of the associate program and into a manager role.  what are the time guidelines etc.  

Thanks,
Rogers
