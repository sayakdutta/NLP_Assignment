Financial settlement occurs between Enron and the customer.  The pool is agnostic to what its participants do (i.e. generators that do 3rd party physical hedge are still paid by the pool, consumers of electricity who do 3rd party physical hedges also pay the pool)

Derek/John,
 
Quick question... from what I have read, it  appears as though the way the Power Pool works, the Pool settles with the buyers  and sellers each month.  However,what happens when we contract with a  counterparty directly?  Does the pool collect payment due for energy  delivered under a bilateral contract and then forward payment onto the  supplying party?  Or does the financial settlement occur directly between  Enron and the counterparty?  Please advise,
 
Thanks,
 
Wendy
