Wilson,

We are trying to finalize this transaction by next Tuesday, and I could 
really use your help.  I believe you owe me a draft of an opinion letter?  
Also, do you have any comments to the draft agreement I sent out last week?

I also need an opinion that the language in the agreement re the Cities 
obligation to financially support MDEA is sufficient.

Thank you,

Kay
