In a hearing off the Floor this afternoon, the Assembly Appropriations 
Committee voted on a partisan basis (14-7) to pass AB 2xx (Corbett), which 
would enact a gross receipts tax on power generators.  Please note that three 
amendments were adopted by the author:  (1) exempt state contracts (not all 
long-term contracts like SB 1xx does) and the taxpayer would have to go to 
DWR for this exemption; (2) taxpayer would get a credit for any similar tax 
paid in another state (assuming other states will actually enact windfall 
profits tax bills; (3) PUC will adjust the base price quarterly (rather than 
"from time-to-time").
Next stop is the Assembly Floor, planned for Thursday morning.
