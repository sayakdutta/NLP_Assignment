Gwyn,

Thank you for you efforts on this. As I've told Cindy, we really need you to send it to us this evening (Houston time), so that we can put it into the model tomorrow morning (UK time). Could you please copy in Joyon Manning and Suryan Wirya Simunovic when you send it.

Regards,

Paddy.

Hi Paddy,

We are finishing up the Turkey curve and will have it to you by the latter part of the day on Thursday.

Thanks,

Gwyn Koepke
