I worked with a guy named Richard Mescon of Morgan Lewis several years ago
against HL&P and Enron.  He was top notch.  Call me for more details if
needed.





I anticipate that Enron may have some legal issues in New York similar to
the issues Enron has faced in California.  Can you recommend a top notch
trial lawyer (similar to yourself) at any firms in New York?

Thanks
