Are you a mind reader.   I set up a once a week meeting every Monday at 4:00pm (EB641) to go through East Positions (wholesale & T&D) and discuss process, deal review, big risk items, new deals, etc.  In attendance will be:

	Berney
	Busby
	Don Black
	Rogers Herndon
	Jay Lewis
	Joe Wagner
	Narsima Misra
	Jubran Whalan

I recommend a bi-weekly meeting with the group of 6 (Belden, Presto, Lavo, Richter, Black, Herndon).   I will assume Kim will coordinate with the asst's to schedule time and location.




	

 

I would like to have a meeting once a week for 1-2 hours with all 6 of us just to make sure we are moving forward and to get an update and anything and everything.  My only concern is that we take the boys away from their overwhelming task.  What do you guys think.
