You got it.  I will be in Cabo this weekend with Wolfe's boss (tim belden - my counterpart in the West) and I will talk with him about their real-time trading needs and timing.

 

Kev,

I am ready to compete.  Give Greg a call when you get a chance
and I will start on a resume and cover letter.  No doubt I will
be a peak performer.
