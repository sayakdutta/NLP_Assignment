Chris buddy!  How's it going?  I was chatting with Dan this morning and
I was able to track down your mailing address, so I can send you a
wedding invitation.  You're still M.C. right?  Just kidding, but it'll
be good to see you.  I hear everything's going good down there, speaking
for the rest of your buddies up north though, I'll be looking forward to
when that career path steers you back a little closer to home.  The
wedding is on August 18th(saturday), Mike & Nate are planning some golf,
camping and a little drinking as well on the August long weekend too if
you were planning on being back then as well, although that sounds like
a lot of travel.  Anyways, I suppose II'll see you at Sue and Dionne's
wedding?  Should be a good time.  Take it easy, Chris.
