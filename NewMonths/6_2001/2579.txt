Mark,  I forgot to mention in my earlier note, that for the parking/storage 
arrangement with Bay Gas, I would request their form of storage agreement.  I 
makes more sense to have a separate agreement cover the parking arrange as 
this is really independent of the compression services.  These storage 
company typically have their own agreement that not bad and usually won't use 
the counterparties paper.
