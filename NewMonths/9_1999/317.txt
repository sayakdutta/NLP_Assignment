The meeting is on our calendars for 9:30 am 9/3/99.  Let's talk about the 
NYMEX hedge exemption/position limits process and the reasons why you need 
attorney backup when Mark is unavailable.  Also, highlighting specific NYMEX 
rules and regulations/Enron trading policy issues for me would be helpful.  I 
am only looking for broad oversight.  We can meet with Mark when he returns 
(and have Taffy put us on Mark's calendar). Thanks.  Sara

If possible, can we hold this meeting until Mark gets back.  I think Mark's 
input is the most important.
