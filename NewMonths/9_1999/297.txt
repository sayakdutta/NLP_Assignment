Mike,

You may recall that I have asked that Brent Hendry, an attorney in our Buenos 
Aires office, be given access to our Lotus Notes Master Swap Agreement 
Database and that appears not to have happened yet.  Can you please let me 
and Brent know what needs to be done to grant hims access.  

Brent will also need additional attorneys added to the database.  Brent, can 
you provide Mike with a list of any other individuals 
(Legal/Credit/Secretarial only) you would like granted access.

Mike, it also appears Brent would like to copy our database to set up a 
document tracking database in B.A.  Who should he contact here to get a new 
database created similar to ours?

Thanks for your help!
