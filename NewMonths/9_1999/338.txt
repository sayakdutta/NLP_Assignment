I'll originate the call.  Also, I'd like discuss immediate trading objectives 
since I'm planning a trip down south in a few days and can be on the front 
end.  SS

Sara, can you conference us in?  I think the phone quality may be better if 
this originates in Houston.  Thanks.

You are on my schedule for 3 p.m. if it works for Andrea.

I will coordinate with your schedules.  How about 3pm BA/SP time?  If not, 
just propose a time and I'll be there.  SS
