The 15th looks fine.  The 23rd and 24th are already holidays.  As for the 
22nd, please coordinate with the other legal assistants to make sure we will 
have coverage that week.

 I would like to take November 15, 1999 and November 22 - 24, 1999 as 
vacation days.   Please let me know if this meets with your approval.    
Thanks!
