Here is a message from Neal Manne about his availability for the Nov 3 trial 
date.

My trial obviously is running longer than anticipated.  I do not have a good
sense of when it will end.  It will be at least several more weeks.  It
obviously is nearly impossible to do any real preparation for the next trial
while I am still in this one, although Carrin and I have been speaking
regularly and materials have been shipped here for me to review.  Let's
discuss.




Are we running into a problem with the Nov. 3 trial setting?
