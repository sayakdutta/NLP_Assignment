Just a 'heads up' - there is now no doubt that there will need to be some 
major revisions to the index language.  I am meeting with some of the folks

review.  Can you please arrange to have the following people given access to 
the Product Manager:

Jeff Sorenson
Dale Neuner
Bob Bowen
Lynn Shivers
Kevin Sweeney
