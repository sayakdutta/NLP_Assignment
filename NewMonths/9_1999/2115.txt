thanks mark.  reason i asked this morning is that richard sanders needs to 
pay to colonial by tomorrow any balances legitimately due colonial by enron.  
IF we withheld the usd 250k (tomas?) and lost the 161 then we need to (a) 
verify by all enclosed that we owe them (250-161) usd 89k and tell richard 
how we pay them (check or transfer or whatever).  pls advise today.




 (3) Yes,  we loss $161 K on the Florida for the Colonial - PGE Sale for the 
99,000 barrels we bought from Colonial.     Mark

it looks as though we overwithheld about usd 80k that is now due colonial

(1) against their invoice to us of usd 1,089,379.26 i believe we paid them 
usd 839,379.26 shortpaying them usd 250k exactly correct Tomas?

(2) we sent colonial documentation (feb 12, 1999 fax from Tomas) showing that 
we estimated that they  owed us usd 132,752.92 for the barging on the first 
(and subsequently only) lifting from colonial to pge correct Tomas?

(3) however we subsequently found  that we incurred usd 161,406.59 in total 
costs as evidenced by leskowitz's spreadsheet dtd 8/23/99 right Mark?

Chad, Mark, Tomas: can you pls confirm that we would therefore owe Colonial 
usd 88,590 correct?
