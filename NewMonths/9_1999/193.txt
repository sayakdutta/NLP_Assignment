Melissa,  I wasn't able to redline this version, but I added sections 10 and 
11 and added futher language to Sections 3 and 6.  Hopefully you can redline 
it against your old version.  

Let me know what you think about environmental indemnity language.  I think 
is is prudent from the view that Black Hills and has been using the Premises 
for some time and we are not sure what is out there.
