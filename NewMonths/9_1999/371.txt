How about 2 pm on Thursday, Sept. 23 in your office?  Please let me know.  
Regards.  Sara








MEeting on the 23rd at your convenience is fine.  24th would be OK also in
the afternoon.


You should have received a fax with the comments on the ISDA. I will fax the
article.  Surprisingly enough it was on word, so you should have been able
to open it.
Best regards.
