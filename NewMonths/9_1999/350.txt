I would like the credit group to respond to the following:

1.  What person in credit is the initial contact for the preparation of 
credit worksheets for structured transactions?  How can we insure that the 
process will run smoothly?

2.  Can we (credit and legal) schedule a meeting with a trader to walk 
through the actual termination amout calculation process?

3.  With respect to L/C's, does credit review incoming L/C's for content?  If 
not, we need to establish a procedure?

Enclosed is a list of proposed credit issues to be discussed at our lunch on 
Monday.  I would like to send this to credit later today so if you want me to 
add anything, please let me know.
