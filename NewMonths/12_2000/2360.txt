kay - believe me, i understand.  plz also understand that ben's lastest 
guidance to the team (see my last email) was for me, chris booth, and you to 
meet with outside counsel to assess/divine the strength of our "case" with 
respect to siemens-westinghouse.  again, plz see my last email on guidance 
received from ben.  per your note, both chris and i are prepared to meet with 
you next week to start/continue the process.  since you have outside counsel 
covered, then we are good to go.  your thoughts?  are you available next 
week?  plz understand that i am not trying to infringe on your turf.  
regards.  scott.

Scott,

I'm handling outside counsel, and spoke with him this week.  I'm prepared to 
give legal advice on the issue.

plz provide name, address, phone number of outside counsel.  i'd like to set 
up a meeting for early next week between scott, chris, kay, and outside 
counsel to outline the issues and establish the framework for an expedited 
legal opinion on enron's position.  plz advise.  thanx.  scott.
