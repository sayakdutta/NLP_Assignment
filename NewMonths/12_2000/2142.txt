Nothing new to report.  I received an official copy of the inventory list 
last night.  I will try to get it notorized and mailed back to the lawyer 
today.







My question I guess is, what case?  What is the status?

We can sell the tractor anytime as far as I'm concerned.  We will have to
pay some extra taxes but that's ok by me.  The lawyer said we may have to
buy a replacement if we loose the case but she doesn't think we would
loose.
