I've been notified that the California Commissioner has cancelled the meeting 
with stakeholders that had been scheduled for this afternoon.  He'd scheduled 
it to discuss what the order the Commission intends to issue on Thursday 
might look like.  It signals, at this point, that the utilities continue to 
have a difficult time reaching agreement with the administration.  Will get 
back with more as it develops.
