Very interesting.  Quick questions:  1) $100MM come out of our pockets?  2) 
Could we "guarantee" 500 MWs?  3) Would we identify and implement DSM at our 
customers' sites?

What about offering to creat 500MW of supply in CA  by spending $100m on DSM 
in the next 6 months, in exchange for equal treatment DA vs lg customers.

This idea has not been vetted by management or DSM guys, so please don't jump 
to it yet.
