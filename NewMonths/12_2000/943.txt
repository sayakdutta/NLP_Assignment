Attached is a draft application, including exhibits, requesting FERC approval 
to replace the existing 10,000 HP driver at the Gallup Compressor Station 
with a 15,000 HP (Service factor 1.1).  Please review, provide coments, and 
sign and fax the FERC authorization form (7592 in Omaha) to me no later than 
3 P.M. on Tuesday, 12/19.  Any questions, please let me know.  Thanks.  Donna
