You have the original file there.  I should be able to send you a
blackline by the end of tomorrow.  Will that be soon enough?





Do  you have the original file or do we have it here?  Enron Corp. wants
to
have this in place for equity trading.  I can look at it quickly and
perhaps shorten the response time.

I am working through revisions (based on the fact that Enron Corp. is
the party instead of ENA and the fact that there is no CSA).  Is this a
high priority?




Jason:  Where do we stand with respect to this party?  Sara
