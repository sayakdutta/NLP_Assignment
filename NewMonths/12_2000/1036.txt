Would you let me know if confirmation letters have already been sent out for 
these deals? If not, is there any way to get them out before the holiday?

Thanks,
Kate

Hi Kate,
Deals #478168, 478944, 478945, 478946 are to be confirmed by either Greg 
Wolfe or Christian Yoder.  We need to get the final copy of these confirm 
letters so we can scan them into the system for our files.  Also, if the 
finalized confirm has been sent to the counterparty we need to change the 
status in the system.  These deals are still showing up on our "New" report 
every morning and I need to do something with them.
Thanks for your help!
Kim
