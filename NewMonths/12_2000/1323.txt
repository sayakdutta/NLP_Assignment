Enron supports employees' involvement in civic organization
and I think you should continue tour involvement with LWF.
It's important that we give  something back  to society.
You don't have to take a day off to attend workshops.

Vince,

I am currently a candidate member of Leadership Fort Worth through August of 
2001.  I don't know if you are familiar with Leadership Houston or any other 
Leadership group, but it is basically a civic organization that provides a 
forum for leaders to learn more about their community and opportunities for 
civic leadership.  For their first year, members are candidates and must 
attend about 1 full-day workshop a month in FW, normally on a Thursday.  
After that, members can transfer to other Leadership cities.  I talked with 
Stinson about the group and he thought I should talk with you about whether 
or not I should stay involved with LFW.  The attached email describes the 
December meeting scheduled for 12/14.  Thanks
