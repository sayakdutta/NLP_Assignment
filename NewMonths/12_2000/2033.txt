Attached please find revisions per our conference call. Excluding all but 
one, we made Enfolio changes proposed by Michael. Our only deviation was to 
delete article 4.2,  sec vii, re: MAC.

Based on your QUICK feedback, we will send execution documents electronically 
so Janet can initial.

Please call me at Gerald's office if you have any questions.

Regards,

Stephanie
