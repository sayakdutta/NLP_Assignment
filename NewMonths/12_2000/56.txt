Hello UT Candidates,

As most of you have already heard unfortunately Becky Bruce is no longer with 
Enron.  My name is Kristin Gandy and I will be taken over recruiting for UT.  
I wanted to send you a quick email to let you know about some changes we are 
making.

Attached please find a document with information containing Enron's offer 
letter revisions.  Have a wonderful holiday season and I hope to hear from 
you soon.

Please contact me at 713-345-3214 if you have any questions.

Thank you,

Kristin Gandy
Associate Recruiter
