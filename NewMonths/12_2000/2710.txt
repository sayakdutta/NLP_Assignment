January 5th, not December 5th.  I'm glad to see that someone besides me 
writes down the wrong date once in a while.

David Thomas' office confirmed with me today that he will be the SF office on 
December 5th.  He will be there at 10:00am.  

Joseph - could you please book your conference room for the meeting?  I would 
appreciate it!
