I am asking Molly Magee, our HR rep,  to set up an interview for Iris Mack
with, depending on your availability between Christmas and New Year.

 Iris was interviewed by a number of my associates for a position
with the Research Group and my objective is to introduce her to a number
of Enron  units that she may eventually support. I shall appreciate your 
comments.
