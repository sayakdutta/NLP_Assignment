we'll get tuxes. 

however, folks won't be going leaving at the same time, so going to the 
airport together seems unlikely. and it being new year's eve, i would 
strongly suggest taking a cab from the airport to the hotel---gonna be a 
zoo.  but, on the other hand, if scott and cameron are in for picking folks 
up, god love 'em.

Dad forgot to mention: 
DRESS CODE (strictly enforced):  Black tie or lingerie - so Jeff and Scott if 
you do not own a tux you will need to rent one or a peignoir!

I think we should all try to depart at about the same time so we can go to 
the airport together.

Can anyone pick us up at the airport when we arrive on Sunday?
