You have my proxy.  Please let Anthony know what you think.

Thanks,

Since I bought Bobbi a spot on the deer lease we have a total of 6 deer to
kill this year. If you want more than one deer your welcome to it. 6 is way
more than we can eat. Unless we skip breast feeding and start the baby on
deer meat.

How do you want it processed?  1 or 2 deer?

Smoked Sausage - Mild-Medium-Hot
Pan Sausage - Mild-Medium-Hot
