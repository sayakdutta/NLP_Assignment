Matt:

This is still outstanding and we may have to change Part 3 of the Schedule to 
reflect the change.  DID YOU SPEAK WITH OUR FRENCH LAWYERS?  Please let 
Stephanie know.  Sara

Sara,

I am going to ask Matthew Dawson to deal with this as I shall be out of the 
office on the 7 & 8 Dec myself.  

Matthew - please check with Hugues de Robillard of Slaughters Paris if point 
(1) is ok.  Please also let Susan Hopkinson know that you will be dealing 
with this.

Mark:

I am about to finalize comments to the SITA Master ISDA Agreement on behalf 
of ECTRIC.  I need your able assistance with respect to the following:

(1)  SITA has not passed a board resolution authorizing execution of the 
Agreement.  Instead, SITA proposes a certificate stating that its President 
Directeur General or Directeur General have, pursuant to the Articles of 
Association, full power and authority to execute the Agreement or to grant a 
power of attorney to do so.

(2)  SITA has requested evidence of EEFT's authority to sign on behalf of 
ECTRIC.  I have sent a copy of the power of attorney to the lawyer and will 
ask that she direct any questions to you if I am not reachable.

SITA's attorney is Susan Hopkinson at Lovells in Paris.  Her phone is 33153 


I will be out of the office Dec. 7 & 8.  Stephanie Panus if assisting with 
the file.

I look forward to hearing from you.  Regards.  Sara
