Just one note.  I have a typo in your company name in the address, it needs 
an "r".  Fax it back to me at 713/646-3490 and I will get it signed by 
Enron.  Thanks for such a quick response!

Thank you Tana. Shall I fax the executed copy back to your attention? Can
you please provide me with your fax number?

Regards,
John
