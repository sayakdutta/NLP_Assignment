     Jeff,

     Attached is a draft of the equity forward contract which we believe is
     compliant with EITF Issue 00-19.  Please have your auditors review it
     to determine if this contract should get equity treatment under 00-19.

     The document is blacklined against your outstanding equity forward
     contract so that you can easily identify the changes.

     I'll touch base with you on Monday.

     Regards,
     Christine
