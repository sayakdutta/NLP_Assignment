Per review of the Risk Management Policy and discussion with Rick Buy, the 
Chief Risk Officer is responsible for maintaining the list of authorized 
traders for Enron.  I am charged by Rick with the policy administration 
responsibility, and consequently, Veronica and I have been in the process of 
obtaining updated authorized trader lists.  I understand from talking with 
Legal today that in the past Mike Moscoso from Shona's group maintained this 
list and provided it to Legal, so I think there are several versions of 
authorized trader lists floating around.  I noticed this since the brokerage 
agreements and officer's compliance certificate that I have to sign had 
attached a list that was inconsistent with our records in RAC.

Anyway, we're getting the "official" list together - hopefully by Monday, at 
least for the Enron North America traders - and we will provide to both of 
your groups.  Then going forward we'll get the lists posted on the RAC Market 
Risk Management web site and keep it updated for trader turnover/reassignment 
so you can both access any time you need to.

Best regards,

Cassandra.
