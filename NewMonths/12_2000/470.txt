Jeff,

Steel has been removed and a second worksheet has been added which shows new 
products made available in the past 24 hours which were not available in the 
previous 24 hour period.  Let us know if this is sufficient or if you would 
like to see additional information added to the report.  

Thanks,
Pete

Steel is not part of global markets, and if you could take it off this 
report, I'd appreciate it.  Also, Please add a section that shows new 
products as we add them to the portfolio.  

Thanks.  Jeff
