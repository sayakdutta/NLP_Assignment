Diana is having Prebon look into this. It's not the kind of trade their desk 
would be doing right now, so they're skeptical; should just be a couple 
minutes.

Any word yet on this trade?









Sean and Diana do not recognize this deal. They tried to check with the 
brokers, but couldn't get a hold of anyone. I'll let you know first thing in 
the morning whether or not this is good and what the deal number is.
