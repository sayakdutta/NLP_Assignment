If I change my name to Mr  Crankman (for today only), I'll think of a name 
for you, too.

how was your weekend?  how was Philly?  I want to hear about the party.  I 
heard you got out of making a speech!  Emma's naming was really nice.  I am 
kind of overdosed on family, but my mom is here until tomorrow so guess what 
I am doing tonight????  Tomorrow night one of the little ones is singing at 
the Galleria, and Thursday another one has the staring role in Guys and 
Dolls.  She is actually a great little actress.  Am I the best cousin or 
what?  I schlep to all this stuff!  I really do love it though.  

What is new with you?
