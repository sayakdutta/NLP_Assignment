I am hearing that it may be premature to do an ISDA energy conference in 
Tokyo because almost all the products being discussed so far are physical.  
What do you think?

Hi Mark,

There will be a one-day WRMA conference here (Morten Erik and Mark Tawney are 
involved in these arrangements and Mr. Wani, lawyer of local derivative fame 
will be talking at the conference) in late Feb or early March.  Date will be 
fixed later this week, likely to be March 5.

Jane:

ISDA is planning an energy seminar in Tokyo in mid-May.  We have heard there 
may be an energy seminar in March or April in Tokyo.  Have you heard of the 
earlier seminar?  We are trying to decide whether it makes sense to go 
forward on the May seminar.  Could you look into this and talk to the traders.

Thanks for your help.

Regards,

Mark
