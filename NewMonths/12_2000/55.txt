He sounded reasonably intelligent but nothing to get too excited about.  I'll 
be shocked if he gets redshirted regardless of how good Hayter is.  BEnson is 
the 4th all-time rusher in texas history having just passed the great Robert 
Strait from Cuero (85-88) and almost passing Rodney Thomas.  Those guys don't 
get redshirted.

I'm befuddled about the O-line numbers.  Ya'll got this kid Winston this 
weekend over us even though we have only one OL commit and need 4 or so.  
Slocum  has got to close the deal on a few more of these top recruits or we 
are doomed.  2 of the top 3 linemen are still available and we've got a 
reasonable shot at them but Hightower (#1) still says he's going to visit and 
consider Texas.  Amazing...
