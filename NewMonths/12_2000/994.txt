I will be revising the Capacity Release and Agreement and the existing 
Trailblazer Assignment that Huber currently has to reflect the Transaction 
just completed today.  

Mark,  you probably should make Huber aware of this if they are not already 
so.  Thanks.

Gerald - I forgot to include you on the assignment of P.A. with Huber?

As of 4:00 p.m. today, the ENA executed Precedent Agreements have been 
delivered to Trailblazer.  

Trailblazer still has outstanding P.A.'s , but expect delivery tomorrow.  
Their current schedule is to send the filing to FERC on Friday with the 
actual filing date on Monday, December 18th.  Should Trailblazer not meet 
this time frame, I would suggest that the matter be taken up at higher levels 
in the organization (i.e. Julie call Deb).  

I'll follow-up on Monday.
