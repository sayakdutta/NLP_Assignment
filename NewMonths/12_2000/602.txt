Richard, 

Folllowing our meeting of the 9th November, I have now written a business 
requirements document, which will be included in the final specification to 
be sent out to the vendors under consideration for the supply of voice 
recording services. This document is attached below. 

Before sending out this document I wanted you to have the opportunity to 
review the content and comment upon any statements made within it. 
In order to progress this component of the ECS project we will be sending out 
a specification at the end of November, so if any feedback could be given 
before that deadline, it would be appreciated. 

I will ensure you are also sent a copy of the final specification provided to 
the suppliers. 

Thank you for your assistance with this matter. 

Regards

Stuart Fieldhouse
