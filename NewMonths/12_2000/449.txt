family was crying.  we are such dorks!!

it doesn't look that different.  it is just fun to do!  I hope that you were 
comfy and cozy sleeping late this morning.  I dragged, I mean dragged myself 
out of bed this morning and got on the treadmill.  Only for 35 minutes though 
b/c I was so tired.  call me later.  have you been to Zula yet?  I am going 
tonight and I wanted to know if it is good.



I'm out of here at 4.  Good luck with the new hair--i'll talk to you later....
