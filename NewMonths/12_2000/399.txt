Wanted to let you know that EWS Compensation team will be finalizing 2000 
bonus amounts on the Monday of the MLK day holiday (1/15) and the weekend 
prior.

Please provide Sheila Knudsen's assistant, Carol Coats contact information 
for one or both of you in case any judgement calls need to be made.

Thanks,
Shanna
