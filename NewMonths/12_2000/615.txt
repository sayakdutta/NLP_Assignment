Senator Burton, President Pro-Tem, has asked for the name and address of
all the CEOs of the "generators".   This request has come through Julie
Malinowski from the Independent Energy Producers' (IEP) lobbying firm,
Edson and Modisette.  Burton gave her a list on which Enron appeared.  I
asked her to eliminate us from the list and say that we are not generators.
If Burton comes back anyway, I have given Julie the names and addresses of
Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling.
