Attached is a clean and redlined version with my changes.   Please note the 
following:

1.  I added back the limitation on damage provision I originally had.  We 
need to be clear that the remedies specified in the amendment are the only 
remedies.
2.  Changed both Seller and Buyer Minimum Volume Obligations to be consistent 
with each other.

The amendment for the Powder River contract should reflect the same.  Please 
contact me at (713) 853-3512 if you would like to discuss.
