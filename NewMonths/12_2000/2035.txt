Attached are the executables.  Please note the a redline of the Capacity 
Release and Assignment Agreement is also included.  I cleaned up references 
to the Renewal Notification (which are now the Non-Renewal Notification) that 
were missed earlier in Article 3 and Article 5.   

Please note the Exhibit D of the Enfolio Master also needs to be signed by 
Calpine.
