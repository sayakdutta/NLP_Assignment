Yes, the following trade was cancelled, Bloomberg failed to send a 
cancellation.  Called Bloomberg, spoke to Trish, and she emailed me a 
cancelled copy.  Thanks

According to all the guys at the Long Term Northwest desk, this trade was 
cancelled by Bloomberg. Let me know if Bloomberg still thinks it's good, and 
I'll have the traders call over there.

Thanks,
Kate

Hi Kate, I have a broker confirm from Bloomberg for the following deal:


Deal 
Enron buys from Idaho Power

January 2001  $300.00   25 Mws  Mid Columbia

Mike Swerzbin was the trader.

I cannot find this trade in the system.

Let me know,

Thanks,
