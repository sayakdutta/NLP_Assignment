Dear Drs. Roberts and Benjamin,

Vince Kaminski and I enjoyed and appreciated the opportunity to speak with 
you this morning. Enron is very happy to agree to participate in Stanford's 
GLOBE project (being conducted in partnership with McKinsey & Company).

Attached please find my business card with all of my contact information.

 I look forward to hearing from Dr. Benjamin in the near future to begin 
Enron's involvement.

Thank you!

--Christie.
