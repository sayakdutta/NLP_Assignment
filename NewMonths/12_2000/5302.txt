sent to Leslie's attention......





There is some misunderstanding.  I still have not received the fax of the
NDA.  Did you have it to my attention, Tana Jones, at fax no. 713/636-3490?

Coming down first thing.








We do not appear to have received your fax of the NDA.  Can you please fax
it to my attention at 713/646-3490 and I will distribute it to the members
of the Enron Team.  Thanks!

We are fully executed.



I will fax a copy to your attention and you can distribute to your people
as
needed.

thanks for all your help.
