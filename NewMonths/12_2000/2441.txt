Lisa is a real hoot. Smart, tough as nails.  She pulls no punches.  

Michael seems to feel better, but he has terrible circle under this eyes.  
I'm going to insist that the doctor give him 3 rounds of antibiotics.  Being 
a boy, it isn't so bad.  I just  know that the strep is hiding in his 
sinuses, so a week after he gets off the antibiotics he gets sick again.  

He slept until 800 today, and hour and a half later than usual.  I think that 
must be his body healing.

He is so excited that 6 flakes of snow might fall tonight.

Paige wrote me today, said she is freezing (she's north of Austin).

I just love Lisa, she's a little bulldog isn't she.

How is Michael feeling?  It's cold outside!

why does LM6000 contract still have brackets around the number of turbines to 
be assigned to WestLB?  Why does it still ignore the change orders rose asked 
you to include?

why does schedule v to PA still ignore the change orders to the various 
documents?

Please correct or advise why requests for changes are NOT being made.

As you know,  these documents are deliverables on Wednesday.  Blue Dog had 
comments from the other side today.  Why haven't I seen a revision or been 
asked if I agree with their comments?  

Please do not operate in a vacuum without consulting me or Roseon 
questionable issues.

Regards,  Lisa
