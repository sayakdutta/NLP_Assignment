I don't have any language like that on hand.  I suspect it will be in great 
demand!

Have a great holiday,

Thanks Kay.

On the GE and ABB contracts, we will be assigning the breakout contracts down 
to the project development entity (LVC2).  LVC2 will then make a partial 
assignment of the guaranty/LD/warranty provisions to the EPC contractor.

Have you done an assignment of this nature in connection with any other 
equipment?  If so, do you have some language I could use?

Thanks, and happy holidays!
