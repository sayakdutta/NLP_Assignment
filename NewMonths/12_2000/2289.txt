Guess we need to make the final decision.

I have booked the 9:45 seating for New Year's eve at Sambuca's Jazz Cafe. Mr. 
Pink will be performing until 1:15am ( I know that's late for you Cheryl). 
The $100 per person fee covers food and entertainment. The meal will have a 
couple of options and sounded very good when read to me over the phone. 
Gratuity of 18%, tax, and alcohol are not included. We can all settle up on 
the night so no one has to worry about that until next year!!

We have one extra seat so if someone has a good idea of how to fill it, 
please let me know asap. Until I next see each of you, have great holiday and 
drive safely.
