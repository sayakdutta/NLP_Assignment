I'll let you know where you can go.  Probably pretty much anywhere in Buddy's 
or I might can arrange for you to sit in another area.  It won't be a problem 
but we will need to communicate.

 Right now my friend Weldon is hunting in my blinds as he has not gotten a 
deer in 6 years and has paid my Dad ~$5000 over the period.  Paul is still 
hunting in there too and that's where Travis killed his deer.

Take the last three days with a grain of salt because those forecasts are 
automated and tend to spit out some garbage.  However, a true blue norther 
should be coming and don't be surprised if Dallas sees the teens next week 
with highs below freezing.
