Phil:

Why don't you execute (duplicate originals) and overnight to me? I'll return 
an original to you tomorrow (overnight), as well.  I'm located, specifically, 
at:

1400 Smith Street, EB 3801a
Houston, TX  77002

Please call if you need anything.  Thanks.

I have been speaking with Soma regarding the markup of the collateral
schedule to the Margin Agreement between Enron and Mahonia as well as the
Enron/Chase ISDA limiting the collateral to direct obligations of the US.
We needed to determine whether we could accept your proposal.  I have been
advised that the changes you requested are acceptable.  Accordingly, all
the amendments can be executed.  Please contact me regarding how you would
like to accomplish this.











Phil:

I was just checking to see when we would execute the amendment to the
Security Agreement (to permit the rehypothecation of securities).  Please
let me hear from you.

Regards,

Sara
