From the most recent information we have, the most likely outcome appears to 
be the following:

As we've discussed this week, the administration and the utilities continue 
to have a very difficult time reaching agreement on 1) how much of the 
undercollection the IOUs should absorb and how much consumers should absorb 
and 2) how big the rate increase should be to manage the IOUs cash 
flow/credit  problems (governor wants 10%, IOUs want at least 20%). 
It remains likely that the Commission will rule today on relaxing regulations 
to make it easier for the IOUs to enter into longer-term contracts w/out 
getting 2nd and 3rd guessed by the Commission.
It is likely that the Commission will signal strongly that it will not let 
the IOUs go bankrupt but will only go so far as to outline its plan for 
considering and implementing a "rate stabilization" plan in Q1 2001.

That said, the stakes are very high and things could change dramatically 
between now and 2 PM PST.  Just talked to two SVPs with PG&E and Edison and 
they said that they don't know what the Commission will do at 2.
