The original GE West LB agreement, please.  

I suggest that you contact Lee Johnson via email, copying his lawyer Kent 
Shoemaker, asking for a proposed form of liquid fuel guarantee.

I do not know what this guarantee looks like.  Liquid fuel is only
referenced in Section 10.8.4.  Do you want me to send a blackline of
what I sent out last night against the GE form agreement or the original
GE West LB agreement?






I like that idea.  Do we know what the guarantee is supposed to look
like?
I don't have the agreement with me (see below).

At last word the Coral deal was sidelined.  More to come.

I'm at home with a sick child today.  When you have a redlined version
of
the ESA stuff (redlined against the master), please email it to my
assistant, Suzanne Adams, so she can print it and have it delivered to
my
house.  If it is being printed by AK in Houston, please have it
delivered
to my house at 29 Inverness Parkway, Houston, 77055.

Thanks,

Kay









I think we'll have to add a section somewhere, perhaps 10.8.5, in the
agreement. I'd like to try to keep all of the guarantees in the same
Article of the Agreement.





I thought we weren't going to have an exhibit U anyway, since we are
plugging things into the text of the document.

I think the real point of the question is the reference to the liquid
fuel
guarantees, and where these will be reflected.

If we aren't going to have any site specific information, then I don't
think we need an Exhibit U.




Ben decided to send the exhibits to Coral, so that's where this question
came from.

Will we have an exhibit U?

I know we owe you some answers from your email of the 6th.

Ben, Exhibit U indicates that liquid fuel guarantees are in Sec. 10.8.4.
I
could not fine them in that section.  Could you point me to where the
liquid
fuel guarantees are located?
