These folks will need to be added to the distribution list.  Lysa/Joseph:  
it's going to be a bit wacky, because, as the note indicates, I'm not sure 
what time the call will be.  Anywhere from about 11 AM to 2 PM PST.  We'll 
need to keep the number of ports as unlimited as possible, because I have a 
feeling that the note indicating that there be a meeting will get around, 
perhaps globally.  As soon as I know what time I'll want to have the call, I 
will notify Joseph, who will need to set up the call and distribute the info 
to the original list I sent around plus the names below.  If you two have 
suggestions on how you'd like to handle, like Ross Perot, I'm all ears.  
Thanks so much for your help.

Also, please make sure to add Vicki Sharpe and Michael Smith of EES on the 
list, too.

We will set up a call-in number to relay to folks any actions the Commission 
takes tomorrow.  The Commission meeting starts at 10 AM PST, but it's unclear 
when they will take up our issue.  Since the press will likely have the place 
surrounded, they may decide to do that item first.  We'll send out a notice 
with a call-in # and time as soon as we have the information.

Best,
Jeff
