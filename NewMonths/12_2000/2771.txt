The Assembly and Senate Republican caucuses are holding an energy briefing
for its members on January 4th from 9 am to noon in room 126 of the Capitol.
I don't have all the details on the briefing but speakers were invited by
Assembly Member Anthony Pescetti and will be given the opportunity to speak
as well as to bring up to 10 pages of written materials to hand out to
members.

Please let me know if you have received an invite and/or are speaking at
this briefing.  So far, Williams is the only IEP member company participant
I have heard about.

THANKS.
