its okay, its not a big deal, i just wanted you to change it instead of me, 
just to be sure.  i am always usually in such a hurry when i talk to you.  
but, since it has slowed down a bit......i wanted to let you know you are 
doing a wonderful job, and you really are a pleasure to work with.  again i 
am sorry if it seems like i am always in a rush, just tell me to chill out.  
but, thanks for being so great.  i will pass that on to the traders when i 
get a chance!

I just added it. I don't know why, but I checked Jeff's Deal Blotter and he 
had entered the broker. For some reason this did not transfer over into Deal 
Entry. Sorry!

481433 needs a broker








First deal is 481433. Jeff Richter entered this awhile ago.

Second deal is 481489. Sean Crandall forgot to put the broker in - he's 
adding that right now.

Thanks,
Kate
