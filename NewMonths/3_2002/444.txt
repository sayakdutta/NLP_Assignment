We need to revise the Master Log to specifically identify ALL of the parties to the Master Netting Agreement between the Dynegy group and the Enron group because all contracts subject to that Master Netting Agreement were terminated effective as of December 20, 2001.

This should pick up Dynegy Canada Inc. and ENA pursuant to the Mster Agreement dated as of 6/16/95 and cause our recent default notice to become moot.

I have not pulled the Master Netting Agreement today.  Let me know if you have any questions.
