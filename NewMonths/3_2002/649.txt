Craig,

Just wanted to drop you a quick note and thank you again for taking the time to meet with me on Thursday.  I know your schedule has been busy of late, but I very much appreciated having the chance to speak with you regarding Cinergy and the Cincinnati area.  The types of roles available with the company at present struck me as both exciting and promising opportunities.  Good luck in the continued efforts to move the company in the desired direction and I look forward to speaking with you in the future.

Thanks,
Susan
