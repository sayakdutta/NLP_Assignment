FYI, Kim.

 

Kim, could you let me know who the team can talk to about their concern over TW pipe ownership?

 
Cc:	Trout, Lonnie

Randy - Tony has some concerns about the possible ownership of some of the abandoned pipe from the TW system.  We had assumed that all of the pipe was either sold or abandoned.  Tony said that Lonnie seemed to have some information about what may still be under ETS' ownership?  We would like to identify exactly what we need to be responsible for so that it can be adequately protected against possible encroachment problems.

Thanks! - Weldon
