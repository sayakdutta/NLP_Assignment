Just finish Centana and then we can work on the next thing.  By the way, any word from your buddy at Duke?

 

Sure would like to be able to sell that inventory.

 

Nothing has changed.  We are still trying to figure our some way to sell this short/long term.  In fact, I have requested permission to show these documents to potentially interested third parties and haven't heard back from ChevTex.
