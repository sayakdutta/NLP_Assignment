I am so sorry,  a lesson on communication.  I called and left a message and waited by the elevators.  Lets try for Thurs or Fri?  

 

Hey, lady,

I just got back from eating on 2.  I grabbed a table and looked for you the entire time, but didn't see you.  Then I got your message.  Where were you?

Let's try it again soon.
