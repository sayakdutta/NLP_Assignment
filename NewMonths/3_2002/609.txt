There are 2 Con Eds and I believe this is a contact for the unregulated side.
Mario Karlovic  914-993-2153.

I don't think Chevron-Texaco has a trading group other than Dynegy.

 


Joe, Chris, Ruth -

Do you have contacts at Chevron-Texaco, and ConEd that I could call regarding the auction of the gas contracts ?

Thanks.
