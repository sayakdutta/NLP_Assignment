Kim,

Per Jan Moore's phone conversation this morning requesting the TW Capital IT project expenses for 2000 to Current:

The RMS work orders show a total of $105,622 actually billed to TW. The budgeted amount was $690,510. The work orders never were allocated with the actual costs, so majority of the actual costs are still showing up on NNG's books.

The Market Intelligence work order shows a total of $36,949 actually billed to TW. Let me know if we need to discuss this further.

Thanks,
