Mark, let's discuss this and get with Kevin.  Thanks, Kim.

 

Kim:
In the past, we have looked at this as a joint venture - my understanding is that this has been changed to an undivided ownership at the TW level.  From a deal structuring perspective, this is a major change. I just need to re-think this one a bit.
