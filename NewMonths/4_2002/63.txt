DUDE, I'LL MEET YOU AT YOUR HOUSE.  I WANT TO SEE WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.
 

Right on, works for me, just call me when you get off and I can meet you there, or we can meet at the house, I live a couple blocks from there.
Just take Macadam south all the way out, it turns into Highway 43, and follow it through Lake Oswego.  Once you pass Marylhurst College, you'll see a Burgerville on your left, Buggati's will be just past the Burgerville about a block and 1/2 on the left. It has a green and white sign in front.  If there is no parking available in the front lot, you can park in the Starbuck's and McDonald's lot.

If you want to come to house  - go about a half a block past Buggatti's, you will see McDonald's, that's Walling Way, turn left and follow the road down to Old River Rd., turn left onto Old River and go over 3 speed bumps.  Robin View Drive will be the next street on your right, turn right and we are the third house on the right, 3680 Robin View Dr.  Blue/Green house with white trim and bricks lining the yard.
