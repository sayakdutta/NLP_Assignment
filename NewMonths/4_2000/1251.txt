Hi, Shane.  Here's a quick update.  As you can see, the Westpac ISDA is a 
done deal.  Susan Bailey (paralegal) had been holding the Commonwealth ISDA 
because she didn't have an address.  I asked her to email you for the info.  
I am working on ABN AMRO.  I' m also trying to keep up with you other trading 
activity.  Let me know if you ever have any questions.  Sara
