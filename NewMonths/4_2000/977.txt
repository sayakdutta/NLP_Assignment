Are you sure about this?  I didn't know I had a NY bar number.

We will need to obtain from you each of your bar numbers for the State of New 
York in order to obtain CLE credits on your behalf for attending the Enron 
Law Conference.  (Tami, there are two names on the second page of the New 
York sign-up sheet that I could not read-maybe you could send this message on 
to those two people if you can read the names).  Thanks.  Brenda McAfee
