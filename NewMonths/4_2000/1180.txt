As you may know, Project Ghost was unwound eff. 3/31/00.  I believe that 
Project MacArthur was also unwound. (but I haven't seen anything).  Also, 
Project Blackbird is in the process of being unwound.  Each will have a Swap 
Termination Agreement.  Brenda Funk should be organizing closing docs.  
Please make necessary entries on Lotus Notes and keep supporting 
documentation in the files.  I don't see Projects Ghost, Spector or Hawaii on 
Lotus Notes (these show up on your status of files list to Mark.  Thanks and 
let me know if you have any questions.  Sara
