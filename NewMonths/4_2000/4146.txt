Jana,

It was a pleasure meeting  you and John last Saturday.
Let's meet again soon. Maybe this film about the suburbs when it 
arrives in Houston.

Dear Friends:

I will be out of the office on business from
 Friday, April 21, 2000 until Monday, May 8, 2000.

I will not have access to my email. I will be checking my voicemail on a
daily basis.  If you call my office, please tell my assistant that you would
like to leave me a voicemail message.

If you need to get a hold of me, you can page me at 888-502-7685.
I will return your call as soon as possible.

Thank you.

Jana Phillips
