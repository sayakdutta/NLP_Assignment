Marie:  Per my voice mail, please let me know when you will have your memo 
regarding brokerage agreements and the updated list available.  I would like 
to include Susan Flynn, Sheila Glover and Laurel Adams in a meeting since 
they are all involved in the brokerage agreement process from time to time.  
I'll try to gather the group if you provide me with some suggested times.  
Thanks.  Sara
