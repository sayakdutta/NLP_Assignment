 I have been advised by our Client Services office that 4 vans will
be at the Andrews Street side of the Enron Building from 5:00p.m. until 6:00
running shuttles back and forth from Enron to Enron Field.  From 6:00 on 2
vans will be at the Enron building and 2 at Enron Field to bring people back
and forth.  The van drivers are supposed to have signs for easy
identification.  Please let others who are coming know of these
arrangements.

 We look forward to seeing you there!
