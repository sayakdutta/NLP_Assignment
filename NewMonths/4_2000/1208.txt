I am hoping to have Lotus Notes available to you in about two weeks.  The 
initial view will include Master Swap Agreements and I am working on "Other 
Agreements" which will include brokerage and repos.  On a slightly different 
note, do you think we should schedule a regular [weekly] meeting to review 
work in progress, issues, products, etc.?  If so, who should be included?  
Thanks.  Sara
