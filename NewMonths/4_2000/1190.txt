Raymond can we discuss. 

(a) This is definitely a possibility. We could back the trade out to EAF 
through an ISDA Agreement we have with RMT (an Enron company based in 
Houston).  
(b) This is also an alternative from an Australian regulatory perspective. 
(c)  Conceptually no reason why not except EAF  has no underlying ISDA 
Agreement with SG USA. Also I suspect this would be less tax effective than 
either one or two. 
(d) Another alternative - We have an ISDA Agreement between EAF and SG 
Australia Ltd . Could these entities be the contracting parties?

Raymond it is really a tax call as to which is the most effective contracting 
structure. I have copies in Susan Musch (our Houston based tax expert). Susan 
have you any ideas. I suspect also there will be some Enron management 
determinations as to the identity of the Enron entity entering into the 
trade. 

One other point Raymond if ENA is the contracting party it really is outside 
my jurisdiction. I would request  Sara Stackleton (who recently assumed took 
overe from Shari Shackleton) assist.

Dear David,

We are about to do a weather trade with SocGen or Aquila on Melbourne 
temperature
Expected trade date is Thursday - 13 April.
Steven Vu, Head Weather trader in Houston will transact with above thru a 
broker in US.

Premium approx 700k AUD.


What is the best way in terms of regulations and tax - assume limits in place 
!
Houston is to take a  portion of the deal too.

(a) ENA trades with SG USA, then back to back transact between ENA & En Aust ?

(b) ENA trades with SG USA, then gives p&L to  En Aust ?
can this P&L be real income or shadow only ?

(c) En Aust trades with SG Usa ( thru Oz arm of US broker or thru US broker)

or any other suggestions ???

Pls revert :o)
Thx,  Raymond
12 April
