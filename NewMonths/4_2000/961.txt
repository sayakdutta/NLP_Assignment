I had a note back from Doc asking if we wanted to go to the play after 
dinner.  If we're not interested he can go on Sunday but if we want to go 
he'll get us tickets.  I can go either way - what do you think?









Then the Barnstormer it is....a lot like the markets these days anyway!

"Good meal" in Monmouth?  Not sure if that is really possible by your
standards.  I had the Barnstormer in mind.  It pretty much has to be better
than the food at the Stockdale Center.

Oh....Yes I will be there. I arrive early on Thursday in Moline. Plan to
visit
the Boone grave site and then drive down. I just signed up for the dinner
thing
yesterday. I'd rather be with you and Doc. Maybe I can cancel once I get
there.
I will send an email. Are we going to get a good meal.
Mark

Are you planning to attend the planning committee meeting in Monmouth next
week?
I'm setting up dinner with Doc (instead of the Private Dining Room affair)
in
case you're interested.
