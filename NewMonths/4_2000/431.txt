Please find attached an explanation of how the $2.8M was negotiated from Dave 
Foti and myself.  The other file attached is the calculations per the 
contracts we executed with ESC and the earnings impact, if we agree with ESC 
new one time payment.  

 The economic benefit  to be derived from this change may or may not be 
achieved, because it is dependent on ESC and TW ability to avoid the peak 
demand  charge.  ESC has an obligation in the contract to assist TW in 
developing a system to monitor and avoid the peak demand charge.  If ESC 
receives this benefit in  the one time payment, TW may lose any leverage we 
have.  The demand payment includes full payment of these peak demand charges 
with ESC rebating the 
 cost on a monthly basis, if these charges are avoided.

 If we need to develop our negotiating strategy before we meet with ESC on 
Wednesday, please advise.

 
 Dave Foti & James Centilli
