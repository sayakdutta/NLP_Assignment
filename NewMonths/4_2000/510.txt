Kay,  Could you please send me a copy of the CA.  Thanks.





Gerald:  Sorry for the delay on these.  I thought I had responded, but don't 
find a "Sent mail".  We have nothing relating to Horizon.  There is an 
executed agreement with Merrill Lynch re financing for Trailblazer Pipeline 
Company, but nothing with Trailblazer.  I'll put the datasheet in your box.  
Let me know if you need to see the agreement.
