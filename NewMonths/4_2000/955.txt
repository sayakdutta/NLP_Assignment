When I try to open the link I get an error message saying "You are not 
authorized to perform that operation."  There are still no requests awaiting 
my approval in the SRRS icon on my desktop.

Sorry!

Please be informed that you  have one or more SRRS requests that are 
outstanding due to a pending action to approve or reject decision on your 
part. Please  go to the SRRS (Lotus Notes desktop icon) and select the 
"Requests Awaiting my Approval" option and complete the necessary  action. 
More SRRS request information can be seen within the request by clicking on 
"Resource Display".  

Your response will enable the SRRS process to continue for eventual closure. 

Thank you,
