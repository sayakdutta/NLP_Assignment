Dear Friends of the Institute for Energy Economics and Policy

The attached power point presentation "Oil and Gas Markets: Myth and Reality"
was given today to a major luncheon (April 18th)  meeting of the American
Association for Petroleum Geology Annual Conference in New Orleans.  The
presentation looks at current oil and gas markets during the last year and
the next twelve months.

IEEP makes occasional papers, research, and analysis available to the friends
and supporters.  This work asks the question of whether current prices are
sustainable and examines the impact of weather and non market factors on the
market.  If you would like to know more about our efforts to develop EWxAS,
our analytical and risk managment product, please contact us.

I thought you might find the attached presentation interesting and perhaqps
useful.

Regards

Dennis O'Brien
