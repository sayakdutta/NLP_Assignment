I agree.  This is not a big enough dollar issue for them to make a huge 
stink, is it?  If it is, can't we match them stink for stink with all the 
imbalance penalties we have forgiven in the past?  DF


   
	
	
		







Based on the above, it seems that the decision to advise them we can't retier 
still stands.  Isn't there a way to give them the $30,000 of value in another 
manner which doesn't make us file for waiver? Alternatively, we have given up 
more than this in the past to resolve their errors, don't adjust?   We can 
still tell them we plan to address in our Order 637 filing-  MK

For PPA's in November, 1999, December, 1999, January, 2000 and February,
2000, the UCU issue of tiering is only with the November, 1999 PPA of
$30,475.61. All other PPA's are at Tier 1.

Please let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks. Lynn
