John and Sara

In reply to your enquires:

Infinity number 10300 is a hedge that was put on with SBPL.  This is to 
remain in place
Infinity number 25556 is a hedge that was put on for SBFL.  This is to remain 
in place.


The other deal that you enquired about was a simple passthrough of cash.  
This was a spot deal and has matured.
