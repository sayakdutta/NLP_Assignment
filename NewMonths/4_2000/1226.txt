Marie is updating her list and preparing a general memorandum in connection 
with the brokerage and futures agreements.  I have the following times 
available to meet (and I think we should schedule about an hour):

Thursday between 1:30 and 3:15
Friday   after 10 am

Please let me know as soon as possible of your preference and I'll try to 
accommodate everyone.  Thanks.  Sara
