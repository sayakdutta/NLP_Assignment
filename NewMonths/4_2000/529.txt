Ron,  Couple of comments.  
 1.  Enitity Name - You noted that Trailblazer is a limited partnership.  The 
name should designate limited partnership in some form (e.g. Trailblazer 
Pipeline  Company, L.P.)  Also for an LP the General Partner will need to 
sign to make it binding.  The signature block should read as follows:

  Trailblazer Pipeline Company, L.P.
   by its General Partner, _________________________

 2.  The limitation on consequential damages limits any remedy under this 
agreement.  The only types of damages in a situation like this is really   
consequential.  I think it would benefit both parties to leave this 
limitation out of the agreement.

If you would like to discuss these issues, please contact me at (713) 
853-3512.  Thank You.








My comments are shown redlined.  Let me know if you have any problems with
my changes.
