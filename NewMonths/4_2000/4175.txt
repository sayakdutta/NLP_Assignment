Vince - Please ask your associate to contact Laura Valencia in my group - she 
can give you the recent 1Q anaylst slides and the Enron.com year end 
presentation on the web (these two should give you enough for a "basic" ENE 
pitch.  Mark

Mark,

I want to ask you for a favor.

One of my associates, Stinson Gibner, is making a presentation to the MBA 
students at
Texas A&M University next week.

Do you have a Power Point general presentation about Enron, emphasizing our 
growth,
creativity and employment opportunities? We could use it for presentations
we make on campuses to business and science students. There are many 
presentations available on our Intranet site, but the are outdated.

It was nice meeting you in San Antonio. 

Vince
