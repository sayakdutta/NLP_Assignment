Hi! This is the ezmlm program. I'm managing the



Messages to you from the storm mailing list seem to
have been bouncing. I've attached a copy of the first bounce
message I received.

If this message bounces too, I will send you a probe. If the probe bounces,
I will remove your address from the storm mailing list,
without further notice.


I've kept a list of which messages from the storm mailing list have
bounced from your address.

Here are the message numbers:
