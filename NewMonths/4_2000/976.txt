Thanks for your note - I am actually checking my e-mail with my laptop at the 
airport in Minneapolis.  I was in DC on Wednesday (too bad Tim & Sharon 
aren't back) and then flew on to Monmouth (well, flew most of the way - the 
closest airport is still a bit over an hour drive away) for a capital 
campaign planning committee meeting.  Mark Kopinski was there and he and I 
had dinner with Dr. Kieft (our fraternity advisor and one of my chem. 
professors) who is still teaching.  I'm now on my way back to Houston - 
flight delayed but shouldn't be getting back too late.  Hope you are well.

Love,

Mark
