If the letter is alright, I can have it printed formally.  I never heard back 
from Gareth with respect to any comments.  Just let me know what you would 
like to do.  Sara

Sara,

We still need to get this letter agreement done for Hawaii.  Please give me a 
call when you have some time to discuss it.

Attached is the revised letter agreement between EES and Enron Corp.






Sara and Gareth,

We still need to finish this agreement and have it signed.  To my knowledge, 
it has not been completed and signed.

Sara,

I'm on someone else's computer - I'm having all sorts of e-mail problems 
today.

The business person on the  EES side to be signing this letter would be Mark 
S. Muller.  He is a Managing Director of EES LLC.

I don't necessarily have a problem with the description of the back-to-back 
obligations, but I'd like to know Gareth's opinion as to whether the language 
is too broad.
