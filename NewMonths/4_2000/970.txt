Allison -  I don't think they were expecting Cynthia to attend these meetings 
with me - there will only be one representative from each of the three 
companies.  I did want her to know what meetings had been set up for me 
though and to know I was in town that day in case she wanted me to see anyone 
else.  My flight out isn't until after 7:00 pm. and I assume that the Luken 
meeting will be over around 3:00.

Mark - Cynthia is out of town today, but I let her know that you are coming 
to town and she is more than happy to attend these meetings with you.  She 
will be at 1301 Longworth for the Weston meeting at 9:30 a.m. on Wednesday.  
Would you mind letting me know who else will be attending the meetings so I 
can let Cynthia know?  Thanks.
