I concur.

Clayton,

 my thought is that you should attend the presentation, because it is our 
responsibility to ensure that the groups have the best model available.  Try 
to gauge how well the model backtests (is it just another academic model?), 
and what are the sources of data.  Do not elaborate on your model -- your 
story is that you have the responsibility to analyze economic models of this 
sort in the Research Group.

Vasant-

This guy Mark Breese called Thursday, (a Manager in "Long Term") saying there 
would be a presentation to their group of this commercial model of his 
just-ex employer, and I called him back and said I'd wait to hear from you or 
Vince before attending. I told him I was finishing my model, that Vince 
hadn't decided what we had, that Vince would tell his group what we had, and 
that I was uncomfortable attending these kinds of presentations right now 
because I wasn't clear what all of the agendas were (he's obviously pimping 
for the company he just worked for).
