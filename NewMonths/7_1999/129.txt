Could I arrange a very short conversation with you regarding the May 28, 1999 
memo from Jorge Brito Pereira?  I would like to discuss your analysis and any 
further actions which the local firm may be taking on ECTRIC's behalf.  I 
have a paper trade with a Portuguese corporate pending receipt of an 
enforceability opinion acceptable to ECT.  I'm not sure if we'll get there.  
I'm interested in further discussions you may have had internally or 
externally.  Sara
