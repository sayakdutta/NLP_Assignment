The grand prize is just crazy enough to work...


A contest was held for people to submit their theories on ANY subject.
Below are the winners:

4th RUNNER-UP (rednecks riding in an infinite number of pickup trucks fire an infinite
number of shotgun rounds at an infinite number of highway signs, they
will eventually produce all the world's great literary works in Braille.

3rd RUNNER-UP (yawn to equalize the pressure on your eardrums. This pressure change
outside your eardrums unbalances other people's ear pressures, so they
then yawn to even it out.

2nd RUNNER-UP (Technologically underdeveloped because they have no alphabet and
therefore cannot use acronyms to communicate technical ideas at a faster
rate.

1st RUNNER-UP (faster on its axis due to deforestation. Just as a figure skater's rate
of spin increases when the arms are brought in close to the body, the
cutting of tall trees may cause our planet to spin dangerously fast.

HONORABLE MENTION (in the English language is constant. If omitted in one place, they turn
up in another.  When a Bostonian "pahks his cah," the lost R's migrate
southwest, causing a Texan to "warsh" his car and invest in "erl" wells.

GRAND PRIZE WINNER (it always lands on its feet, and when toast is dropped, it always lands
buttered side down.  It was proposed to strap giant slabs of hot
buttered toast to the backs of a hundred tethered cats; the two opposing
forces will cause the cats to hover, spinning inches above the ground.
Using the giant buttered toast/cat array, a high-speed monorail could
easily link New York with Chicago.
