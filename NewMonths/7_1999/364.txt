Dan,

Thanks for the drafts.  I believe our only comment comes from our 
confirmation desk that the Commodity Reference Price in Enron3.doc should be 
"OIL - WTI - NYMEX".  Give me a call (713-853-7459) if you have any questions.

Jung / Mark,

I've attached amended trade confirmations in connection with the June 29/99
swaps, black-lined to show Enron's requested changes.  Please note that
moving one of the swaps under the TD Bank ISDA agreement will require a new
guarantee from Enron Corp. (I imagine you'll simply duplicate the guarantee
provided for the TD Texas swap?) - can you please forward same to Anne
Scully in Houston.

Please give me a call at (416) 983-9473 once you've had a chance to review
the attached.

Thanks,
Dan
