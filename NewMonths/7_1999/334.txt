I'm not sure if you guys have seen this before or not.  Lousie seems to think 
that you are preparing the U.S. version of this.

I am not quite sure the context of this - if I were to issue a password to 
someone (because I was going to give them readonly access) they would not 
have to sign anything - the requiremetn is for a document to appear on the 
screen though when they login - a read only ETA.  how doe these fit together?

Justin,

I attach a revised Read Only Agreement. I understand that you will circulate
this to the appropriate people. You will see that I have already copied it
to Louise and Elena.

Kind regards.

Andrew
