I have canceled my earlier plans so I have a lot of flexibility now.  If my 
preference enters into the equation, I would say 2 or 6 August would be 
perfect (I could tack a holiday on to one end or the other) but I recognize 
that may be too late.

Justin has informed me that your preference would be 22/23 July.  Is 26th 
July a possibility for you??

Thanks.

Regards.
