Sara:  If the PacifiCorp ISDA we discussed last week is in or through the 
hopper, will you please forward a copy to me?  The guys on the floor would 
like to pull together a form of confirm that they can show to PacifiCorp when 
they meet with them later this week.  The date hasn't yet been set, but it 
could be in a few days.

I hope you had a good weekend.

Perhaps we can talk tomorrow.

Thanks.
