I don't think we should take this at face value -  company the size of Sunoco 
should be able to use an ISDA.

Rod, Marie, and Debra:

We would appreciate your assistance in setting up a master swap and master 
physical with Sunoco.  They would like to use an industrial form instead of 
the ISDA.  The contacts at Sunoco are Robin Brown at 215-977-3759 and Maria 
Sanone.

I would appreciate it if you would put this as a high priority since the 
holiday weekend is coming up.  Please call me at X 35638 if you have any 
questions. 

Thanks,

Nicole
