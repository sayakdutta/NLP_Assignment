All Delaware corporations are registered with the Secretary of State's office 
in Wilmington, Delaware.  Since that office is notoriously slow, if your 
counterparty is trying to get information on ECTRIC they might have better 
luck going through CT Corporation Systems, a company that is in the business 
of dealing with corporate information and issues which has access to the 
Delaware state records.  They have offices all over the place, including 
Wilmington.

Hope this is helpful.

Hello Mark:

a German counterparty asked me where in Delaware ECTRIC was incorporated. 
Obviously they want to  research the company.

Can you give me the name of the city ?

Thanks

BM
