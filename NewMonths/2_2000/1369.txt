I just wanted to tell all of you thanks for helping to get Eastern States 
taken care of this week.
It is finally in unify and paid!  I appreciate it!

Gloria,

I just talked to Trang and she said that they had rep'd over.  You need now 
to create a new statement group with the correct name.

Gloria,
The reason you don't see the contracts on the SG assignment screen or the CP 
name on the SG maintenance screen is because the contracts originally rep'd 
over to Unify with Amreican Refining And Exploration as the provider. Global 
Contracts can help you with touching and re-releasing the contracts. Then try 
it again and call me if you have questions.  Trang x36996
