Great.  The footnote issue scares me.   If we just use the same footnotes as 
a matter of convenience, we may have some flexibility.  DF


   
	
	
		



Per Tim's discussion with Chandler, they do not attach the brown cover, but 
the footnotes used in the brown cover match the footnotes used in the Form 
2.  therein lies the potential problem.  
He also asked for the list of who receives the Borwn cover, Chandler has to 
get from Treasury, which he said they don't like to do.  I told TIm  to 
pursue in the regard it is needed for Conoco litiagation.
