With my recent travel, I am days (maybe weeks) behind on e:mail.  I didn't 
see my name on the attachment.  Do I have access to this?  


   
	
	
		













I have attached a spreadsheet with some basic information that I need in 
order to submit the security request for Livelink access.  Please verify the 
information that I have completed and complete the spreadsheet where your 
information is missing.  

Note:  If the column named New? has the word "Existing" or "Requested,"  I do 
not need the spreadsheet filled out because you have already been set up or 
are being set up.  You are on the list in order to add you to an additional 
group for the budget process.

If you have any questions, please feel free to call me at x3-4758.



Thanks,
Judy Thorne
