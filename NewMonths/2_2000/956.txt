In connection with the trip to BA next week, I am having some problems 
scheduling meetings with other consultants and would like to know whether you 
have been able to schedule a meeting on Tuesday (Feb. 29) or Wednesday (March 
1) with your colleagues and/or the ADA.  I would appreciate hearing from you 
as quickly as possible in the morning because I already have requests to meet 
on those two days.  I would obviously like to defer to your plans.  Please 
call me tomorrow.  Thanks.  Sara
