Attached is a clean and redline version of your document with Enron North 
America Corp.'s suggested changes.  Please call me to discuss when you have 
had an opportunity to review.  Also, does your document contain "coding" 
information?  I was a bit confused by some of the characters appearing in 
your version.  Regards.  Sara
