That sounds right to me - we were going to pay for extra trips (like the ENA 
legal conference int eh fall) but this meeting is for all lawyers so they 
would have to pay for this regardless.

I am preparing my RSVP form and was wondering what Company I would be listed 
under and RC/Cost Center I would be using?  Should I use Enron Expat Services 
and the RC number used for my payroll or ENA or ESA?  I don't remember how 
this was allocated last year.   Thanks.
