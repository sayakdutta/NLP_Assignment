If you want to send them over, send them to me and I'll nominate someone to
oversee it. The guy that runs or legal side is called Harry Stanley on the 
same
fax number, but I would address it to me and I'll forward it and make sure 
they
understand the background. Is that OK ?

Can I get a contact name and number in your documentation department?  There 
has
been a change of personnel on my side.


Thanks

Jeff
