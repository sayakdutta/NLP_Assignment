Stinson,

Should we get him as well?
It seems he has the right skills. 
We might have maxed out on the
number of summer interns through
the A/A program. We would have to
hire him directly.

Hi Ravi:

I had sent an email about a week back with my resume for the summer
internship. I think the address I sent it to was not correct, so I am
resending it. I will also tell the others in the group to send there resumes
to you. Thanks.

Regards,
Shikhar
