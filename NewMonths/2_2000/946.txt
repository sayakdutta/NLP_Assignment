Jim Eden and I agreed to the following:

[1] Cross Default Threshold for Statoil will be $20MM.
[2] Cross Default Threshold on Enron side will apply to Enron Corp (take out 
part about ENA)
[3] Statoil will not provided quarterly financials (only annual)
[4] Set-off: well... I had them in agreeing, but they reneged. 

We also need to discuss the cure period referencing paragraph 7.  I'm not 
sure that I fully understand when this applies.
