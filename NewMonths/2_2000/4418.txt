FYI. 

Shirley (3-5290) is making travel arrangements for me.


It makes sense for all of us to stay in the same hotel, 
irrespective of individual travel arrangements

Dear Vince,

Thanks for your note.  I look forward to seeing you on the 20th.

We usually recommend our visitors to stay at the Park Hyatt on Battery
Street.  It's a 5 minute cab ride (or an easy 15 minute walk) to our
offices.  Should you decide to walk, it is important that you take Sansome
Street rather than Montgomery.  They are one block apart, but one goes up to
the top of Telegraph hill and ends before continuing at the bottom of a
cliff and the other is relatively flat and is continuous.  There are
detailed directions on our website (www.kmv.com).

See you on the 20th.

Regards,

Rob
