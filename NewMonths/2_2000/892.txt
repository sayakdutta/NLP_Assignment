I created this w/s for Marci Youngerman and sent it to the paralegals in 
March-99.  Lotus notes says that a draft went out in that month.  I'm still 
okay with the credit in that draft.

I just finished neogtiating Annex A with this CP and its lawyer for the 
8-month financial deal effective 2/1/00.  The CP is anxious to receive an 
ISDA so that the ISDA will govern this transaction and future transactions.  
Please let me know who will prepare credit (since the CP knows my phone 
number and is awaiting receipt of a draft!).  Thanks.  Sara
