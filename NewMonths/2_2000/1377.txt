I just sent you and email.  Feel free to mention my name to Ishi.  More names 
later today!







Chris:

I just want to thank you for helping me out when we were chatting last
night....I look forward to chatting again. If you get the name of the IT
manager I will definately not mention your name....I understand
completely.....

I hope we can talk again..I'm free this evening, so I'm sure I'll be online.
Have a great day.
