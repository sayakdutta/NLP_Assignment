Elizabeth;
The Research group would like to bring in Robert Lee for a second round of 
interviews. The first round went well. Please make arrangements for him to 
meet:

Dennis Benevides
John Henderson



Also, Felicia Solis has been trying to coordinate interviews for another 
candidate named Puneet Mathur.  

I am at X33400.
Thanks,
Ronnie
