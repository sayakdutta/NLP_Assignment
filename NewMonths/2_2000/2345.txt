Good to see you at lunch.  Coincidentally, I got back to my office and had
several emails from some of our lawyers up in Dallas, saying we had been
approached by Duke about representing them in a large gas litigation matter
brought against them by Enron.  I, of course, told them "HELL NO."  But let
us know if Susman screws it up, and you need us to bail you out.
