Joe, Mike and Kent

Thank you again for your offices' assistance  when we visited last week.

I have attached the drafts of the Sao Paulo and Buenos Aires reports.  Please 
review and let me know 
any comments or questions.  We are trying to finalize the reports as soon as 
possible so your response
is greatly appreciated.

Regards
Kate Agnew
