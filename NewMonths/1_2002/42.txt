yes i gave him a verbal

 

John, we may be able to do something for Tyler on this issue.  However, I have no record on file of his seeking approval to take the courses (CFA, I believe).  Can you confirm that you gave him verbal approval or that you were aware that he was taking the course, etc.  Thanks....

 


Dawn,
Is there any way that I can make a tuition reimbursement claim for the fall? The courses finished before I was let go from Enron, but I didn't receive my grades until recently. Cash is getting a bit tight these days, so I would appreciate it very much if there's anything you can do. Let me know.
-Tyler
