Yes, I can make myself availble for this meeting.  Can we discuss either later today or tomorrow for a  pre-meeting?

Thanks, Kim.

 

Eric/Kim/Danny:
Are you available Wednesday afternoon at 1:30 to talk with ArcLight Capital regarding (i) Sun Devil, (ii) TransPecos and (iii) NNG? We have provided them with various presentations and economics.  May make some sense to visit beforehand to discuss return profiles.
