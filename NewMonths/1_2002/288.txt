Art,

As discussed this morning, we would like you to prepare the Proof for our SEC 13F filing for March 31, 2002.  When we approve, we will request that you hold until the required release date of May 15, 2002.

Please do not hesitate to call if questions.  

You can bill ECT Investments Inc. for both the December and March filings now.
Please send to my attention at Enron Corp, 1400 Smith Street, EB 3066d, Houston, TX 77002-7361.

Regards,
Sheila Glover
