Thank you regarding Min.  He does an extreme amount of work for us and I believe going forward we will need more rather than less of Excel type reports.

All:  We had set aside slots on NETCO for two EES resources. (Pablo Pissanetzky and Kenny Ha)  Pablo and Kenny have opted to pursue other opportunities.  Min Zheng (Risk) and Bala Kandaswamy (VMS) will be shifted from ESTATE to NETCO.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Steve
