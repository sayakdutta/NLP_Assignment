congrats to Ali

I had to fly to houston on monday on last minute notice, we have been bought by UBS Warburg, I hope that the deal works out and looks good for me, don't know yet but I am excited, how is the condo going?

 

Ali got into STANFORD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  He just found out today!  I
can't believe it!  He was so upset after being dinged by Wharton and then
look what happens!  It's so bizarre how the different schools select /
screen.  Anyhoo...California
rocks!

Talk to you soon,
Lee
