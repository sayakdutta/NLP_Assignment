I was not in the office today.  I just check my emails from home.  I'm taking Matt Fleming to YOUR BBQ place next week.  He hasn't found a job yet.  I told him that it felt like a bunch of us estaters would be let go soon, don't know why, just a feeling.

are you in the office today? 
Luling is by the pound, so my eyes are bigger than my gut.
Try Swinging Door in Richmond, TX.
Are you a Joe's fan in Alvin?




Where the heck is Somerset?  And who cares anyway?
 
I hope you had a happy New Year buddy.  Indrid and I went to Lulling City Market over the weekend.  That is without a doubt the best BBQ I have ever had.    YOU DE MAN!!!!!!!!

To my knowledge, we are not agent for these guys anymore.  I will double check with Germany, but I don't think we should roll into 2002.
