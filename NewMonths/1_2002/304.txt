Call me.  Enron MW LLC will be treated like any third party.  Since we do not have our trading order, there are no unwinds or terminations and we do not have special preference for dealing with affiliates.  If this is in the money to ENA, we may be able to expedite the process but we are still dealing with a debtor.  I'm not sure that the relationship to ENA bears different treatment.

 

Richard Tomaski (Chicago office) tells me that Enron Midwest (wholly owned sub of ENA) has certain hedges in place with RMT and perhaps ENA, relating to physical positions we had.  The gas is being sold on Tuesday, so they want to close out these hedges, by unwinding or terminating.

Do you have any suggestions on how to handle this?
