John - Not even the Dec #'s are done yet?  I believe they are planning on mass drafting Monday, so whatever is in the system at this time will go to Unify.  We might as well match Unify even if it is wrong, I guess.

Leslie - thoughts?

Stacey

 

even though scheduling may not be right, or even close? at least for the west.

 

The orig trading books can be set up at a later date.  It should be a while before we have any activity of that sort.  We ran financial liquidations because we have not had any additions to the financial terminations.  I am working on one more big set of counterparties who had auto-termination language in their master agreements.  I vote we catch up with all the information we have as of today and then run liquidations on Monday.  What do you guys think?

What is your status on liquidations? I noticed that you are looking at the fin liq report, etc. Are you running the Max Exp and liq rec even though the liquidations for Dec are not final? 

Stacey, should we have also set up the Orig trading book? Should we have included that in the book requests?
