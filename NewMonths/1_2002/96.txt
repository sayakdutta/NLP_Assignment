Russell and I are both well, probably working too hard.  What is new with you?

Stacey

If you get a chance give me a call - would love to talk to you.  713-853-1870 (w) 281-382-5215 (cell).  I tried the number listed on this e-mail for you, but it just rang and rang.



 


Weldon,

Are you there?  I hadn't talked to you in a while but I wanted to make sure
everything was alright with you.  Let me know.
