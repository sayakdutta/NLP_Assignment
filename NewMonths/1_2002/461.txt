you know its a mouth burger, boca is spanish for mouth




Could someone explain to me what a boca burger is?




I'll take care of all Henry items on my own. (Milk, hot dogs/boca 
burger/juice) Just make sure there is a loaf of bread so I can make him 
peanut butter sandwiches.
Pecan Pie?? yes.
Fruit?? a half dozen good apples.
Skip the baileys (i'm sure joe will agree) there may be some left.
No need for gatorade, water and beer and scotch is all i need. No juice,
we 
can steal some of Henry's.
