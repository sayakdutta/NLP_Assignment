I'm kind of between places right now, so it's probably best to just send things to my parents house

10802 Jaycreek
Houston, TX 77070

and I would suggest trying to reach me via my cell phone:  713-775-6472

i guess i'll see you at the next tasters!!!



 

Susan and Bate,

Please send me your current addresses.  I am sending out an invite for a
shower for Caycie on Feb 2nd.

Thanks,
Lisa

Also send me your home numbers so that I can update my organizer.
