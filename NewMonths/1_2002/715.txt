Yes, this would be fine.  Please stop by and mark your day(s) on the calendar that is pinned up on my wall.

Thanks, Kim.

 

Hi Kim - Would it be alright if I take my 2002 floater day 2/14 pm and 2/15 am?  I've got to take my mother to the Treemont to sign the papers,etc. on Thursday afternoon and then help in the early morning on Friday when the movers come.  Thanks.
