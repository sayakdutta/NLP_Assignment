Now I remember!!!  Do you just need IT contracts on pipes with firm transport or it on all pipelines?  Who is Rita?

 

Hey there...

When you get a chance...I need the IT contracts that might have been used for the East Region for each pipeline. I need to get with Rita Wynne and determine what/if any amount that we owe on these contracts as well.

Thanks
Maria

I just received a call from Carol Taylor at National Fuel.  She told me that contract B00693-038181 was recalled effective 1/1/2002.  This was capacity we received from AEC - one of those producer netback deals.
