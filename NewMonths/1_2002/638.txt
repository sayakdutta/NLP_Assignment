Let's meet after the staff meeting today to discuss carving out existing capacity for June 1 as well as what, if anything, we say to the shippers for now.  Lorraine, would you please bring the volume needed for Red Rock contracts for June and July.  If we carve out existing capacity, we still may not have enough for al of them without prorating.

Thanks, Kim.

 

Please note, included in this report is a delayed in-service schedule for Red Rock.

Stations 1/2 June 15, 2002
Station 3 July 1, 2002

Do we want to tell our shippers yet or wait and also do we want to try to use existing space for the Oneok deal so we do not loose out on any revenue?

 

Attached is the Red Rock, not GTB, weekly report for your use and file.
