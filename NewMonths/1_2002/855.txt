Good.  Glad to hear it.  We are going to try and meet at 10:00 this morning.  Jared is still in traffic right now anyway.


 

my schedule is wide open

 

Eric and Ed are in a Keyspan meeting at 9:00 AM.  Would it be possible to move this meeting to a later time today?



 

Jared, Ruth and I are going to go over all the Florida activity tomorrow morning.  If no one objects, I will be the lead coordinator on Florida starting tomorrow.
