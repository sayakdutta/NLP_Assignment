Francisco tells me that all of the Mexican ISDA Master Agreements provide for automatic early termination (as of the day prior to filing).  Valuation would have occurred as of Friday, Nov. 30, 2001.

The valuation info. that I had (for the parties below) must have come from the commercial people and incorrect.

 

Have they been terminated?  Our file is as of 11/30, but if they have not terminated, the value could be vastly different from that file.

 

I just wanted to verify that the following parties are out of the money (as of 11/30/01):

Compania Minera Autlan
Copamex
Galvak

I was told that these are now in the money to ENA.
