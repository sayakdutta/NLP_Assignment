Julie, 

We need an earlier time on Monday to have the prep meeting for Trans Pecos (it is currently scheduled for 1:30).  Can you tell me what Danny's calendar looks like?  Our meeting with Stan is at 3:30.  

Thanks, Kim.

 

Houston and Omaha ETS Employees,

As you know, Enron reached a settlement with Dynegy, which allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire Northern Natural Gas.

To discuss this action, please attend a floor meeting with Stan on Monday, January 7, from 1:30 - 2:30 in the Enron building in the area of 3922.  Omaha employees, please gather in 227. 

See you then.
