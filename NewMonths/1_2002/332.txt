Tanya:  

EPMI shows up only twice:

Public Utility District No. 1 of Snohomish County
United Illuminating Co.

Also, you have an entry for "Enron MW LLC" as party wtih Peoples Gas Light & Coke Co.  

Was your list intended to capture any other Enron affiliates other than Enron MW LLC?
Are there any other EPMI parties?

Thanks.  Sara

All,

Attached is the 11/30/01 file which is probably the best information we have.  I have screened it so that it only includes those counterparties with financial mark to market exposure.  Additionally, I screened out all Enron entities except for ENA, ECC, and EPMI.  While I cannot guaranty that the data is completely accurate, it should give you the starting point you need to proceed with processing/prioritizing financial terminations.  Obviously, the values will be different from what is specified here based on the Termination Date specified by each counterparty.

Thanks,
Tanya
