At the moment, no.  Can you keep a list of these requests?

 

Sara,
Is there a process for responding to this?


 

The company is requesting some form of acknowledgement or response regarding the reciept of the termination notices they have sent to the various ENE trading companies.  If there is a process that has been established for these types of requests, please forward on to the necessary associates responsible.

thanks
Ed
