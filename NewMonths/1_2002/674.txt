Dennis, 

What are your thoughts on this request?  I'm not even sure that our map department exists because of December 3.  If we respond to her request, we may want someone at an officer level at the Navajo Nation to request this data and then send it directly to the officer.  

Thanks, Kim.




I would caution you that we have not provided any maps since Sept. 11.  Kim, if you feel this is a reasonable request and legitimate, please handle appropriately.

Thanks, Gina

Can you please pass onto to the appropriate personnel?

Thanks,

Toby




Hello,

My name is Rachelle L. Silver and I'm a permanent employee of the Navajo
Nation Government.  I worked under the Division of Natural Resources in the
Navajo Land Department-GIS Section.  I would like to know if anyone there
does any pipeline mapping?  If so, I would like to have a copy of your
latest digital data where the your pipeline covers the Navajo Nation to Big
Boquillas Ranch area.  I would very much appreciate it.  I'll be looking
forward in hearing from you.  Thank you.

Sincerely,
