Please prepare an ISDA for Equities, Interest Rate Swaps, and FX (and for any 
other ISDA instrument) for delivery to:

John F. Miller
Vice President
JP Morgan

1221 McKinney, Suite 3150
Houston, TX 77010

713-276-4602


Are you going to send it out, or are you going to have me act as intermediary?

Thanks
