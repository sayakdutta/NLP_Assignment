Here is the North American legal issues list I prepared for Mark.  He 
actually called me down to ask for it yesterday (my first day back no less).  
Obviously I've kept it to just the major areas where there might be residual 
legal risk.  He seemed satisfied enough with the format.  I explained that I 
had mentioned his request to you and that you were working on a European 
version which might turn out to be somewhat longer since you have so many 
jurisdictions to deal with.
