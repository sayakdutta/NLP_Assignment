The Online Trading IT people have sent us a revised version of the long 
descriptions and a document spelling out the "rules" for how they are put 
together.  Louise is asking for our final comments by close of business on 
next Wednesday (August 18th).  Since I will be out of town then, please 
forward your comments and/or approvals directly to Mark Dilworth.  Questions 
can be directed to Mark Dilworth, Marcello Romano or Louise Kitchen, all on 
the online trading team.

Mark, 

Attached are:

A word document detailing the 'rules' by which product long descriptions are 
structured. 
A spreadsheet containing a tab for each data attribute. 

The spreadsheet first page (LONGS) includes examples of the long descriptions 
for a product out of each product type group (Canadian Gas, NA Gas etc.) 
(these are in column V) - please note ANDY there are no definitions for Coal 
or Emissions locations. 

On each of the subsequent sheets are the long description sentences for each 
underlying data attribute that can contribute to a product (including one for 
each product type) for legal review. 

The product type long description sheet also indicates which GTCs are 
required. 

Please let me know if you have any queries - if I am not available Marcello 
is in the right time zone, and is familiar with all aspects of the procduct 
descriptions. 

regards

Mark
