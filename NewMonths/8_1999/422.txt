Hey Yao!  How are you doing these days?  We never see you anymore.  I'm going 
over to London on Saturday - any chance you'll be in that part of the world?

On a business note, we are getting set up to trade energy commodities and 
derivatives online and one of the things we have to do is figure out what we 
can trade with each potential counterparty.  Do you remember negotiating any 
master agreements for ECT that did not contain the necessary elements for 
trading energy commodity derivatives?  In particular I'm thinking about 
things like the trade option exemption representations and the commodity 
derivatives definitions provisions. 

Thanks!

Mark
