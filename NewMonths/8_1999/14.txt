In light of the recent PCB issue with PG&E on the Topock Lateral,  I have 
asked Mr. John Woodyard of Roy F. Westin to c ome to Houston and make a  
presentation on PCB's in natural gas pipelines.  Mr. Woodyard has 
considerable experience in the management of PCB's and works closely in 
industry associations (INGAA and GRI),  Mr. Woodyard also works as a 
consultant in this capacity. 

The date of this meeting will be on Friday, September 3rd, beginning at 9:00 
am.  Lou Soldano will be setting up a meeting room and will notifiy all 
attendees via lotus notes prior to the September 3rd meeting date. 

I think this meeting will be very interesting and informative and and 
encourage all to attend, if possible.
