I am Asst. Gen. Counsel---Litigation Manager at Enron North America. As the 
title implies I am in charge of all litigation in N. America . I also have 
responsibility for litigation in Europe. This job carries great 
responsibilities. Since I arrived in Jan of 1998, the stock has appreciated 
more than 100%. Need I say more. In this job I am also, on occasion,when the 
mood strikes her, allowed to ask irrelevant questions to Carrin Patman about 
how she is conducting our litigation. Suggestions are strictly off limits.   
I have several recollections--- Who can forget Richard Royd's 7am  breakfast 
meetings to answer associate questions. There was a meeting at 7 but there 
was no breakfast served and no questions answered. Sample question: "Richard, 
why does every firm other than Bracewell have free sodas" Response: "I'm glad 
you asked me that question but first let me tell you about the Bejing office" 
What about the Oscar Madison/ Felix Unger pairing of Bruce Feitchinger and 
Skip McBride.Skip should have known better----when he first interviewed 
Bruce,they  met at Kenneally's Irish Pub.    Personally,since I left the firm 
we have had another son,Matthew,age 11months. Julie has gone back to school 
to get her Montessori teaching certification to be able to teach at Post Oak 
School.
