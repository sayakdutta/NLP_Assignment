Peter,

I looked at the Banque Paribas Agreement.  It is an ISDA Master Agreement 
(Multicurrency-Cross Border) dated as of June 28, 1995.  The Agreement was 
executed between ECT and Banque Paribas.  Banque Paribas changed its name to 
"Paribas" on May 11, 1998, so I think you need to change the agreement  and 
signature line to read "Paribas, formerly known as Banque Paribas". or 
something to that effect.  The agreement is governed by New York law.
