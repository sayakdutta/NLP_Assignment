Andrea Calo and Cecilia are not in the system to allow me to add them to your 
review.  Can you ask them to fill out the form and send it on to me (e-mail 
is fine).  The others were in the system and they should be able to fill 
everything out on their computers.










Here are my suggestions for getting performance feedback for my review.  
Andrea
Calo, Andrea Bertone, Cecilia Morellato (my assistant), Don Black and Scott
Neal.  Let me know if you have any questions or need anything else from me.  I
will also fax to you the forms they are using here for review of expats.  It 
may
be similar to what ENA is using.
Thanks,
Brent
