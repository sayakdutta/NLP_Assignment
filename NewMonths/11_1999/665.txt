I'll be in Sao Paulo this week.  You still didn't send me a mailing address.

Sara - Leica is doing extremely well. She will be 11 at the end of this month
and is still as frisky and active as she was 10 years ago. I suppose sooner
or later she will mimic her owner and slow down! I trust Chloe and her
sibling are doing wel also.   I still own my condo in New Orleans but lease
it to the world's best tenant- a fagotski eye surgeon who pays a lot of rent
and is only there about 10 days a month.When I go down in Dec. (I'll be there
from Dec. 7 to the 27th-will you be there?) , I am planning on staying at the
Avenue Plaza on St. Charles. I'll have plenty of room if you'd like to  join
me.
      I still have Corky's in N.O. which is run by Alan Diamond. We are going
to the Beau Rivage Resort at Biloxi on Dec. 6 for our manager's party. Want
to join me? Am I invited on your family's annual Xmas trip?  Where are we
going? How is your family?
 My mother continues to do well. Bev is in Memphis with a boyfriend and Helen
is in Pensacola and a little more stable these days.
      Mr. Casey and I now have 13 Wendy's in Fla. and are trying to buy/build
more. Want to go inspect them? How is work?
      How are you? Do you miss me? I miss you!     Sam
