From a financial trading perspective, the Credit Group is reviewing each 
potential counterparty and will not approve any counterparty that is not an 
"Eligible Swap Participant" (as defined in federal regulations as over a 
certain size) from trading derivatives.  Generally speaking, they don't 
approve customers that are smaller than that for any trading from a credit 
perspective but that is up to them.

Does EOL have a screening process for special handling of "potential retail" 
counterparty password applications so that we prevent violations to the EES 
Limited Liability Company agreement?
