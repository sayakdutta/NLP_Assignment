I just sent you the letter. I'll be here all day.

Richard,

Jim mentioned that you had forwarded a letter to him -- somehow he never got 
it.  Can you send it to Lucy Marshall and to me, so that we can work with Jim 
to try to get this out today or tomorrow.  I believe we need to move forward 
to try to resolve this commercially but want to proceed with the letter 
first, as we discussed a week or so ago.

I appreciate your help on this issue --
