I called Edmund Cooper and he is out on vacation til Monday.   Do you think I 
should email him the certificate, have him print it out there in London, I 
guess Anita has to initial the two ISDA Master Agreements for signature, then 
Edmund could get them initialled by  Credit in London, and then bring the 
certificates and agreements up to Mark Frevert for signature.  What do you 
think?
