Give me a yell when you are ready to call Golub back--he's an old Baker and 
Botts colleague of mine and I'd like to be on the call just to say hi.  
Thanks. DF


   
	
	
		





Spoke with PNM's counsel (Jay Golub) this morning.  He recognizes that PNM 
needs to get the relevant info to FERC in some form or fashion and would like 
us to tell him who at FERC is assigned to this proceeding so that he can talk 
with them, find out what exactly they need, etc.  He said they would probably 
be willing to send FERC something in writing if it might eliminate the need 
for a technical conference.  Donna--as I've indicated in my voice mail to 
you, just let me know who Jay needs to contact, and I'll call him back.  
Thanks.


   
	
	
		





Drew, Susan, Frank K/Steve S.   can we have Donna check next Monday after 
Dynegy has withdrawn, whether we still need the Tech Conf?
