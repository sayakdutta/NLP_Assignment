Lauren,
Was  a FIP (Foreign Investor Proposal) obtained in order for us to buy the 
shares in the IPO?  If the Mauritiurs entity was authorized to obtain the 
shares through the IPO, doesn't it then make sense that we can sell the 
shares?
Please let me know your thoughts.
Sheila

Also, do we know what the Symbol is going to be for Rediff.com India 
Limited's ADRs?
