I look forward to it!  I was talking to Genia and I also heard how lovely 
your house looked...I can't wait to see yours too!

Great!  

Have a wonderful weekend -- hope all goes well with the move.  As I 
mentioned, we'll be out of town this weekend, so Emma and I will try to stop 
by on Monday to see the house and the kitties!
