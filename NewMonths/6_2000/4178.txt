Gentlemen:

I have been advised by J. Nassos that Peoples (through WestLB) will be 
exercising the ABB option today. I have asked that they send me a copy of the 
notice of exercise of option, and I left Mike Sandridge a voice mail telling 
him to expect it this afternoon.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Kay
