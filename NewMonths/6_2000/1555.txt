Sara, I believe that if possible, we should try to have a conference call 
between you, SusanHelton and Carol St. Clair, because the issues we are 
dicussing at this point in time, relate to both areas:  ISDAs for regular 
financial transactions and ETAs for EOL...Would tomorow morning work for both 
your schedules ?  I know Susan's schedule would work, and mine as well,,, Let 
me know. Thanks and regards.




Jaime:  When speaking with you earlier, I completely forgot to mention that 
Carol St. Clair (Ext. 33989) will be addressing EOL issues arising in 
connection with Enron Mexico Corp.  Please forgive me.  I know that Carol is 
trying to finalize communications with our outside counsel in Mexico.  It may 
be helpful for you to have a conversation with her about your goals, etc. for 
her to include in her discussions. 

I am still handling financial derivatives matters in general for Mexico.

Please let me hear from you and I look forward to meeting with you later this 
week.  Regards.  Sara
