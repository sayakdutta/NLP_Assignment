TIFP's parent, Temple Inland (an ESP), is now willing to provide a $500,000 
guaranty.  This makes TIFP an ESP as well.  To this end, will you please have 
a legal assistant prepare a form of guaranty that would list Temple-Inland 
Inc. as the guarantor for the Temple-Inland Forest Products Corporation 
(counterparty).  The amount of the guaranty will be $500,000.  I would also 
suggest that we lower Enron Corp's guaranty to an even amount.  

Thanks!
