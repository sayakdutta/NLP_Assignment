Thanks for the nice note, I am the person that has the really neat yard that 
was featured in the Chronicle, at least until this weekend when I bought and 
moved into my new house.  I have a lot of work ahead of me yard wise.  This 
yard has "great bones" but has been neglected for a long time.  Hopefully, 
some day it will look as nice as the yard at my old house!
