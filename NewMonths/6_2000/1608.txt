Sheila:  Looks like Rafael never read the email that Susan Flynn sent to 
Nancy a few days ago.  I don't know where this stands.  Sara

 The email that you sent to me below does not pertain to to the referenced 
entity.  Did you send me this email in error?  In order to open to the 
brokerage account for Rafael Rangel, we need corporate resolutions and an 
authorized traders list for the referenced entity.    On June 1, 2200, I 
emailed our form of corp. resolutions and authorized traders list to you and 
Rafael.  I will send the email to you again.   Please advise me of when I 
should expect to receive these documents so that we can open the acccount.   
Please call me if you have any questions.
