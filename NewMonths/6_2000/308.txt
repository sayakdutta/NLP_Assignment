I feel like such a heel.  There is a hidden pocket in my computer bag and I 
had placed my phone and flight info in this pocket.  Thank you for continuing 
to look for the phone.  I am embarrassed.

I had a meeting with Beth today.  I feel that it did not go well.  I asked 
for an IT person that would work in our group and would be expected to learn 
the fundamentals.  I also indicated that I would like everyone in the group 
to learn IT and that we would hire someone to sit on our desk and produce the 
front-end.  She did not like that idea.  Her proposal is that an IT person 
can sit on our desk and decide what IT resources we need and she wants 
front-end production to be handled by her group.  

We ended the meeting with no resolution and we will meet again tomorrow.  It 
seems to me that if we don't have free access to the website or database, the 
group will suffer.  I will follow up tomorrow.
