Mark:  ENA is looking into derivatives trading with an Indian corporate.  My 
latest information is the opinion from 1/14/97 rendered by Crawford Bayley & 
Co. (which was part of our global survey effort a few years ago).  Do you 
have anything more recent?  The ENA inquiry came from the pulp and paper 
group.  Thanks for your help.  Sara
