The Summer Associate Program is a critical component of our recruiting 
efforts.  We appreciate you acting as a Mentor  for the following Summer 
Associate.  

Vince,

A reception to introduce you to the Summer Associates is scheduled for June 
22nd.  The reception will be held from 6:00 PM until 7:30 PM at Sierra's 
Grill located at 4704 Montrose (713-942-7757).  We have also provided the

Thank you
