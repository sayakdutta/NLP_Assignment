I thought I would give you a simple overview of the gas market.  This may 
help you prepare for Thursday.

Everyday roughly 55 Billion Cubic Feet of gas is produced.  The bulk of this 
production is in Texas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma.  In the winter, the US daily 
load is greater than 55 BCF and in the summer, the daily US load is less than 
55 BCF.  Therefore, storage fields are needed to smooth out the seasonal 
differences in load.

Texas and Louisiana are two of the largest consumers of natural gas.  However 
these states produce more gas than they consume.  Most other states consume 
more gas than they produce.  Therefore pipelines were built to solve the 
regional imbalances.  Most of these pipelines originate out of LA and TX and 
move gas to the areas of greatest demand.

Our goal is to gain a handle on where the daily production is moving and if 
the daily production is growing or shrinking.  

Very simplistic, but maybe it helps.
