Plaintiffs are available to mediate on Aug. 25, and so is Mike  Miller.? I am 
just waiting to hear back from IBC's lawyer on his client's  availability.
?
I assume that day is OK for you, as you had indicated that you  could do it 
any day that week.? If so, I will send around a confirming  letter just as 
soon as I hear back from IBC.
