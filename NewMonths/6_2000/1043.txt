Below is the Entergy contact.  I will get back to you asap on how the desk 
intends to trade off the WSPP so you can prepare a memo for the traders.  
Thanks, - Mike

Mike - 

I just spoke to my contact at Entergy.  They have moved exclusively to the 
WSPP contract to streamline their contracts department and protect them 
against inconsistent contractual language.  They are not bending on this 
requirement at this time.  As such, I think we need to proceed with signing 
this agreement unless there are any significant issues.  

Could you coordinate the execution with legal ( I think E. Sager was working 
on this).  Arlyn Kelleher is the contact on Entergy's side.  Her # is 
281-297-3582.

Kevin, Kyle, Elizabeth - are there any significant issues that would prevent 
us from executing this contract?  We need them as a counterparty and I do not 
think sleeving is the answer.

Thanks,
Rogers
