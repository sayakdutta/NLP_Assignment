Thanks so much.  I'm sending your revisions to Scott for review.  The
Confirmation Reply has been totally red lined out of these attachments, but
I am assuming that it remains as we originally designed it.  Please advise
if this is not correct.  If your changes are accepted, I will print a copy
and have Scott McGough execute it.  Please give me your fax number so that
I
can fax it to you.  Regards, Lin Reece

Enclosed is a revised letter.

Dear Carol,    We do not want to create an agreement specfic coversheet for
each counterparty.  Is there some way to put language in the body of the
letter agreement to address your concerns.  The procedure we are proposing
is intended to supplement current requirements in the ISDA, not replace
them.  If you feel that additional definition needs to be added to the
confirmation process, shouldn't we put that definition in the letter
agreement rather than on the cover sheet?

Our goal is to be able to expedite our response to counterparty confirms.
In order to do this we need to have the same cover sheet in place for each
counterparty.  Please call me at 678-579-3378 so that we may discuss
possible solutions.  Thanks, Lin

Carol,  Please feel free to change the letter agreement.  The coversheet
needs to remain as it is, because we are using this same sheet for all
counterparties.  Thanks, Lin
