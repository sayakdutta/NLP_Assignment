I have to move some final things out of my old house.  I hope I close 
tomorrow!  If you would like to meet me at my new house, and then we could 
run over quick and grab the final things I could go after...

If you don't have dinner plans, would you like to  eat out somewhere this 
evening??
I will be here a few more minutes.
