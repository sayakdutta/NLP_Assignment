Sam,

One correction after Stinson in my note at the very end.

You can easily see the correction (redundant "with" was removed).

Vince,

Did you make any more corrections after Stinson?  He sent me the file, I 
removed the comments, and have put it on the page.

Sam,

Stinson's corrections are in red. Mine are in magenta. Remove
all redundant comments.

Vince,

Was Alex's article okay to include in the newsletter?  I'd like to use it 
today unless you believe otherwise.
