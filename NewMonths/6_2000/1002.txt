How big of an adjustment can you make as a percentage and are you guys 
looking at that adjustment?   OR, are you letting the buyer know this option 
exists and you just hope its not your problem by then (that's my guess)?









Yes, we can adjust by 10/15. If we add, must pay retro to 4/1 and if reduce, 
we
may not get any $ back.











Does CES have the ability to adjust the storage MSQ in Sep or Oct?
