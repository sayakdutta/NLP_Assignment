Suzanne:
Marie is included.  Let's see how everyone else responds and hope that we can 
choose Mon, Tues or Wed.  I would prefer Mon or Tuesday because I see the 
doctor on Wed but let's see what works for everyone else.

Am I really included in this lunch?  If so, I will be out Thursday and 
Friday, June 29 and 30.

Thanks!
