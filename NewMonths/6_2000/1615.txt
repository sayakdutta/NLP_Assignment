Jarrod:  attached is language which should be added to all paper and pulp 
omnibus confirms (and Bob has reviewed this language):

  
 Also, attached is the Temple-Inland confirm and I have changed only the 
"Credit or Other Special Provisions" paragraph.  You will have to attach 
Exhibit "A" (which Susan sent you last week).



P.S.  Please verify with credit the timing for delivery of the guaranty.  I 
believe that Paul told me by Wednesday.
