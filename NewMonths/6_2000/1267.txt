I'm glad to hear that someone from Credit it showing up!  I heard we weren't 
going to have a good turnout from you guys, so I expect those that do attend 
will achieve "favored Credit person" status.

takes it out of you.



Always my pleasure. ...I don't want to risk having you unhappy two days in a 
row...by the way, where we you for the ice cream social?!
