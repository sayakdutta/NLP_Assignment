Mike:
Can you give me an update on where things stand with you and your review of 
the docs that we sent to you?  I will be going on maternity leave shortly and 
just want to get an idea of how far along can get this before I leave.  
Thanks.i

Carol:

Why don't you go ahead and send over your CSA form?  I think the idea here
is to have it fully negotiated in advance.  As to the idea of just using
S&P, I will pass that along to our Treasury Dept.

  Mike:
  I have discussed your proposed language with Brant Reves,
our credit person, and
  we are okay with the concept except that we would like for
the ratings trigger
  to be based only on either a drop in the S&P rating or a
failure to have an S&P
  rating.  In addition, Brant has advised me that should we
put in place a CSA,
  that the following would be the credit matrix for collateral
threshold:

  BB to BB+  $2,500,000
  Below BB  Zero

  I look forward to hearing from you.  Should we send you our
form of Credit
  Support Annex?
