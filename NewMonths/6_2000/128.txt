Maybe we can have Schwartz interview them on the next day (Friday) so that we 
give him one shot at them with some ability to control the questions. Let me 
know what you think.

Richard: 

Roland and I are currently scheduled to arrive in Houston (i.e., the airport) 
next week at 12:30pm on Wednesday and depart at 5:30pm on Thursday.? There 
are lots of flights, so we can certainly come sooner and leave later if that 
is desirable.

I talked to Mike Swartz.? He does understand that he is to ask only questions 
designed to prepare him for depostions of Busse and Nolan of Steel 
Dynamics.?? I told him that he might be asking questions by himself, or he 
might be in with other lawyers.? (He seemed surprised that other lawyers 
might be there.)

If we can work it out, I think it would be best to have Kevin and Brian 
interviewed by Swartz separately rather than with other lawyers.? If Mike is 
in the large group interviews, I fear that we will not, as a practical 
matter, be able to draw the kinds of lines that we would like to.? For 
example, I would just as soon not have Farallon's counsel present when Kevin 
or Brian addresses the questions in Robins, Kaplan's letter of 6/13 that I 
just received.
