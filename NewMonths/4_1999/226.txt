It has worked fine for me so far.  I would prefer to continue to receive them 
by e-mail rather than have to go to the Intranet to get them.

As of this year, the O&M Expense Reports have been delivered to each RC owner 
via email from Brian Heinrich in the Reporting Dept. as a test to see if we 
like receiving these reports electronically.  Please let me know whether or 
not this has been a satisfactory method of delivery for the O&M Expense 
reports.  Also, accounting is in the process of developing a system to enable 
them to load the reports on the Intranet and we will then be given passwords 
etc., so we can view and print our O&M Expense reports on a monthly basis.  
If you have any questions or comments, please give me a call at ext. 35448.  
Thanks, Deb
