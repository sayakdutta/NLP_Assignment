Christine and I seem to have gotten Phillips interested in a right to 
terminate if TW's minimum tariff rate ever exceeds the contract rate.  They 
said they would mull it over, at least.

But what they really would prefer to have is a provision in which they would 
get the contract rate no matter what.  Since this would make it a negotiated 
rate deal from day 1, I feel like I need to get your buy-in before we agree 
to it.  Steve has already told me it is OK with him.  Please advise.
