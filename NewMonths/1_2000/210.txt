If you are eligible for a 1999 annual bonus payment, you will receive your 
bonus on Thursday, February 3rd.  

The distribution of bonus funds (net amount after deferrals and taxes) will 
follow your normal semi-monthly payroll deposit method as follows:

If you normally receive a paycheck, your bonus will be in the form of a 
paycheck
If you normally receive a direct deposit, your bonus will be direct deposited 
to your bank account 
For those employees who have taken advantage of the multiple direct deposit 
functionality, your bonus will be deposited to your primary bank account
If you have deferred 100% of your bonus,  you will receive a letter 
confirming your deferral. A pay advice statement will not be delivered

Please call 713-853-9567 should you have any questions concerning the 
distribution of your annual bonus.
