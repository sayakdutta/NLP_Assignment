Rick,

I read your memo regarding Global Risk Management Initiative.  I am sending 
you the
information regarding a related initiative on which I have been working last 
year and which
is moving now into the implementation stage. It's Enterprise - Wide Risk 
Management
and it's really an effort to measure business risks consistently across the 
company.
I hope my group can be helpful in designing the general approach to this 
problem.

Please, let me know what your thoughts are.


Vince
