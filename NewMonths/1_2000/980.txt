Thanks for your help.

There really are no material changes for Texas.  The only issue that I see is 
the month to month change in volumes between December and November 99.  This 
was due primarily to slightly cooler temperatures (Entex takes were slightly 
higher) and an extra day of flow (31 vs. 30).  Let me know if you have 
further questions.


Thanks,

Eric
