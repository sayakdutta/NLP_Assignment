I received the attachment you sent to me at Christmas but was not sure how 
well it worked for you to recieve them.  I took a roll of film to be 
developed and they had a special on having the photos returned on a disk as 
well as prints.  I though they were the Christmas pictures that I could send 
to you right away - but it turns out it was an old roll.
