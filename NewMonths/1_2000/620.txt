Susan,

We have notified Bank of Montreal of our intentions not to verbally confirm 
any deals in which we have done through a broker or through Enron Online.  
BOM has therefore sent us a letter which confirms this for their auditing 
purposes which they would like for us to sign.  We want to make sure Legal is 
OK with us signing something like this before we send it back to them.  Let 
me know if you want to see the Letter.

Thanks,
joe
