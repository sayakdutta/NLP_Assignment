Cindy, I saw this in Jeff's email.  Is there any information we can have so 
that Jeff can make a contribution if he chooses to?

Hello, everyone!    I have some sad news to report.   Stan's father, Eugene 
S. Horton,  passed away yesterday.   I don't know all the specifics on what 
happened, and I don't have the specifics on the funeral arrangements as of 
yet; however, Stan requests that in lieu of flowers...for those of you 
interested...a memorial fund will be set up and he would prefer that you 
contribute to the fund.   We will have those details for you at Tuesday's 
staff meeting. 

For those of you who would like to send Stan a sympathy card, his address is: 
Stanley C. Horton
          70 Champions Bend Circle
          Houston, Texas  77069  

Also, please be informed that we are canceling Monday's EOTT conference call 
and our 9:15AM staff meeting.    Stan will be back Monday night and wants to 
have our Tuesday off-site staff meeting as scheduled.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Cindy
