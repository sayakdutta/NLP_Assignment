RESEARCH ALERT - Enron price target raised

NEW YORK, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Schroder & Co Inc said Wednesday it raised Enron
Corp's (NYSE:ENE - news) price target to $75 from $60 and cut 2000 earnings 
per share
estimates.

-- raised price target because ``as the bandwidth trading market unfolds over 
the next 12 months, we anticipate that an
additional $15 of value will be created for shareholders, with considerably 
greater value possible as the market develops.'' 

    -- cut 2000 estimates to $1.45 per share from $1.55 "due to
fine-tuning."
    -- introduced 2001 EPS of $1.75.
    -- "Bandwidth trading will be a critical value creator in

2000. Enron has built a critical base in the emerging bandwidth commodity 
industry, which is poised to achieve rapid growth in
2000."

-- ``Bandwidth trading keys off Enron's market dominant skills developed in 
trading electricity and natural gas. After executing
the first key bandwidth trade in 1999, Enron appears poised to begin posting 
rising transaction volumes, establishing the
credibility of this new industry.''

-- ``The ultimate value of bandwidth trading is likely to exceed the total 
value of Enron's existing electricity and gas franchise.''
