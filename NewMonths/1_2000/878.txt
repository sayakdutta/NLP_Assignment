ATTORNEY WORK PRODUCT: NOT DISCOVERABLE

 By letter dated January 24th, TVA rejected  EPMI's offer to continue 
performance under the MOPA at market prices.   Accordingly, we sent a letter 
to TVA today, January 25th, at 4:00 notifying TVA that (1) EPMI was 
suspending deliveries under the MOPA effective Thursday, January 27th and (2) 
EPMI intended to exercise its termination rights unless TVA agreed to our 
proposal to continue performance under the MOPA pending a judicial 
determination of whether a Triggering Event occurred under the MOPA.

 Please call me if you have any questions. 

  Copies of the letter will be distributed later today.
