Can we start this meeting later?  We will be trading until 10:30.  Since Greg 
McClendon is out of the office, Carey Metz is trading basis for him.  Because 
Carey is doing that, Stacey is needed to trade Waha.  And she is my backup on 
managing our position.  So, I need to be on the desk during trading.
