Gosh, I had totally forgotten!!  That Friday makes for a long President's Day 
weekend which I was trying to arrange.  Will this lunch be too difficult to 
reschedule?  Just let me know.  Thanks.  Sara

P.S.  Are you feeling better?  You missed our group meeting.  I asked what I 
thought was an innocent question about the legal survey database since it was 
related to part of our discussion.  BIG MISTAKE.  Tana was explosive.  Sorry 
you missed it.

Feb 18 is our credit group lunch.  Do we need to reschedule?
