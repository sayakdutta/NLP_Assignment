I think you are just trying to avoid me!  It's been two weeks, huh?  

I'll be up late tonight watching the national championship, so give me a call 
when you get in.

   are you back at work yet?  sorry i didn't call last night but i got home
   pretty late and had to do some stuff.  i'll try to call you tonight but
   probably won't get home until after 10.
