Chris,

The purchase agreement is on its way over today but I would like to
confirm our plans.  NGTL will buy 50 Tj per day from Enron January 17 to
24, and 15 Tj on January 25 to complete the purchase for a total of 415
Tj.  We are flexible but I need like to lay out a schedule in advance.

Have a good week-end and feel free to call me (541-4726) if there are
any questions.
