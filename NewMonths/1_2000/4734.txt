Gary,

I shall stop by in the afternoon. Such a hurricane would bankrupt a few 
insurance
companies.

Vince,

We're working on a hurricane linked interest rate swap.  I'd like 10 minutes 
of your time to find out your opinion regarding the effect on long and short 
term interest rates of a category 5 hurricane hitting Miami.  I'll explain 
the deal in more detail to you then.
