In discussing the Omnibus with outside counsel on a deal, I am not clear that 
the definition of "Loss" picks up the concept of "Unpaid Amounts."  Arguably 
it does (although the concept of "Unpaid Amounts" is built into the ECT 
Master upon which the Omnibus was based for Early Termination for Events of 
Default but not followed through entirely for Accelerated Termination Date).  
My guess is that we decided that Omnibus "Loss" pv of economic loss includes 
both past amounts owed/subsequent valuation.  Can you recall?
