Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Company shouldn't be a problem for 
weather transactions.  The Master Agreement we have in place with them is an 
ISDA Local Currency.  The only thing we need to cover is in the confirmation 
adding the trade option rep for weather, since weather wasn't covered way 
back then.  Otherwise, they are already approved for all products for online 
trading.  Since the master is a Local Currency form, we might run into some 
problems if they wanted to trade non-u.s based products, or use any other 
currency other than U.S. $$.  If either of those issues come up, let me know.
