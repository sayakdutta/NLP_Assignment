Here are comments on the draft:

12.  "Location, if any, of any office available to the general public or 
Maine customers:"  The draft says "N/A".  Shouldn't we put in Houston 
office?  Dan A's office?

13.  Customer rep. --Ramona in Dublin is EES customer rep.  Who will be ENA's?

15.  Should EPMI's response be limited to supplied RETAIL electricity in 
these jurisdictions?  Otherwise, all 48 states should be listed for EPMI.  
Also, the current EES sales in NEPOOL (New Hampshire and Rhode Island, I 
think) are made by EPMI.  There was/is also a retail sale in the MAPP area by 
EPMI, I think.

21.  EES' response is not exactly true with regard to EPMI, since it has been 
involved in civil legal actions.  However, does this really request any civil 
cases?  Can we answer by saying "no enforcement proceedings by any state in 
which EPMI is providing retail sales of electricity?" 

Tom, The application says "Q" is attached as other supporting material, but I 
can't find Q.  Also, you marked the Annual Electric Utility Report for 1998 
as "A", but I am not sure where it should go ("A" is already answered.)

Thanks for the information.
