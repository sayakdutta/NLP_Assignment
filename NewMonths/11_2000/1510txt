It's possible that someone in Alan Aronowitz's groups has looked into similar 
issues.

The pulp & paper group is looking into physical trading in the Far East 
(mainly Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore).  I am looking into any tariff or 
taxation issues related to transacting in this region.  I've been talking to 
Peter DelVecchio and he was in the process of contacting outside help in this 
matter but then I realized that some of this work might have been done 
already since we trade liquids in that part of the world.

Do either of you know if this information is available internally?

steve
