Dennis:

You have attached a form of confirmation for a very specialized derivative 
transaction, namely, a CREDIT derivative.  The transaction that Enron and So. 
Cal. would be executing would be a COMMODITY derivative (that commodity being 
power).  The confirmation format is similar.  I will send you an example 
later.  Sara

Sara,

    Is the attachment the form of confirmation that would be employed for a
Enron/SCWC "contract for differences" transaction? I pulled it from the ISDA
website you mentioned. For Dave's benefit, the site is www.isda.org. Sara,
Dave advises SCWC on energy matters.
