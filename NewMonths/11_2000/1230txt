Thanks for checking. I changed this deal to reflect off-peak hours only. 

Also, Tom Alonso just let me know that deal #460678 actually has a Mid-C 
delivery point, not Palo Verde. I changed this as well, but wanted to let you 
know so you can re-confirm.

Thanks,
Kate

Hi Kate,
I called Seattle City Light to verbally confirm this deal and they said that 
it should be Off Peak.  I spoke with Matt Motley who agreed.  Can you change 
this deal to Off-Peak hours?  If you want to check with Matt, that's fine.  
We're not supposed to make any changes to West deals otherwise I'd do it 
myself.
Thanks!
Kim
