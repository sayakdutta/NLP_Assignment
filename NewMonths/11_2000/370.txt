Here's what I've added to my answer to address Ni's question.  Let me know if 
you have comments.
I'll have a final draft out shortly.

 Prior to the deadline for filing interventions, Transwestern received a 
request from Commission staff for clarification of the criteria for awarding 
of Shipper call options.  The procedure will be as follows:  an advance 
posting will specify the term of the available option, term of transportation 
service, transportation volume, and instructions for bidding.  Shipper call 
options will be awarded based upon the highest rate payable for the option 
component.
