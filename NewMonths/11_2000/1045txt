Thanks for hosting, Kim.  Jackie mentioned the list of tasks that remain to 
get this done (e.g., graphs, make spreadsheet pretty, write-up, etc.).  I'lll 
do whatever needs to be done, so once folks have picked which task they'd 
like to take on, just let me know what's left.  Or if there's another way 
folks would like to divvy up the chores, that's great, too.  Have a great 
weekend.  See you Monday.

Jackie, could you email the latest version around when you get a chance?  
Thanks.

Best,
Jeff
