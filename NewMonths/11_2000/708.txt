Marti asked me to poll the Board to see if there is a strong preference for 
meeting at a different time of the day than we have previously been meeting. 
Board meetings would still have to be scheduled for Mondays, since the Museum 
is closed to the public on that day, but could you indicate below if you 
would like to keep the meeting at 4 pm or possibly change it to Noon:

I would prefer that Board meetings be scheduled for Noon

I would prefer that Board meetings be scheduled for 4 pm

The results of the poll will be discussed at the November 20 meeting (still 
scheduled for 4 pm in Cullen).
