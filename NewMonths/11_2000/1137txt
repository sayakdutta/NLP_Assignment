Greetings Professor:

I'm in charge of managing our collective responses to this week's case and 
have been called out of town on business at the last minute.   As a result, 
if I make it to class at all tomorrow, I unfortunately won't make it until 
after the break.  While I think one of my teammates will bring a hard copy to 
class tomorrow, I wanted to plan for any mix-ups (contingencies?) by emailing 
a copy as well.

Best,
Jeff
