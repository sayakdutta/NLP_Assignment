Hi Mark,

I thought I was in my "final" office.  Where am I moving?

Just a quick note to give you as much warning as possible.  The current phase 
of the office construction process is almost finished.  We have been given a 
completion date when (we hope) your new office will be ready of Monday, 
November 20.  Your assistants can help you order boxes and arrange your move.
