Here is my attempt to flesh out the Escrow Provision. Feel free to mark it up 
all you want,  If you can - mark it up by hand and  fax it to me before you 
go to Ella's school function. (My FAX NO. is  (503) 464-8058.)   I will then 
turn the document around in advance of our call with Gayle McKenzie at Morgan 
Lewis which is confirmed w/ her and has been set up for  2pm Houston time on 
Tuesday. 

If you need to reach me - please call Jan King on (503) 464-8814 or my direct 
number (503) 464-8782. 

Thanks so much for all your help,

Shari
