Gentlemen,

Things are heating up, no pun intended. Therefore, it would be helpful if you 
would prepare a closing list for the GE turbines moving out of WestLB.  I 
know it is short, but I thrive on lists.

I cannot tell you how many calls I've swapped with ABB's rep about that 
contract, without ever hooking up.  I see that we will be facing a fire drill 
quickly in getting at least some of these transformers into the right 
financing vehicle.  Therefore, please prepare a list of site specific issues 
for that document as well.

Thanks,

Kay
