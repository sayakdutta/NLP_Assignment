Hi Dale,

There is another change order #1 which has been signed by ABB but not Enron, 
relating to the cancellation of a couple of transformers.  I don't think it 
will be signed until next week.

Can this change order be used as incentive to get ABB to the table on the 
breakout contract?  

I'm sending a copy of this to Kathleen Clark at EECC and Ben Jacoby, just to 
make sure there aren't any other change orders floating around.

Ciao,

Kay

The final (?) draft of Change Order #1 for the Las Vegas transformers under 
the West LB contract is attached.  Please confirm whether this should in fact 
be Change Order #1.  If you see anything else you would like changed, please 
let me know as well.

If everything appears to be in order, I will ask Chris Calger to sign the CO 
and get it off to ABB.

I can be reached on my cell phone at (503) 803-1700.

Thanks.
