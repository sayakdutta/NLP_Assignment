Delaney, attached fyi is the testimony PG&E submitted to the CPUC last week
on financial issues associated with our TRA undercollection and TURN's
petition for modification.  Also attached is a copy of yesterday's ruling of
the administrative law judge rejecting this testimony for consideration as
part of the evidentiary record of this phase of the proceeding. Needless to
say, we believe our testimony is informative and helpful and should be
considered as part of the overall policy debate on this vital issue.

Please feel free to pass this testimony along to others who might be
interested, and feel free to give me a call if you have any questions.
