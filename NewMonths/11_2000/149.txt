Both 457489 and 459812 were logged in Mike's trade book with "no broker fee" 
written in the margin. I checked with Mike Driscoll, who helped Swerzbin 
enter the deals, who verified that these are sleeves of other deals and do 
not require broker fees.

Let me know if Natsource still disputes this.

Thanks,
Kate

did you even find out about deals 457489 and 459812?

thanks








I've checked with Matt Motley and changed 458712 and 458718 to reflect broker 
fees of .0075.

I've left a message for Mike Swerzbin to double-check. He has 457489 entered 
in his log book with no broker fee, but 459812 says nothing either way; so 
I'd like to get ahold of him before I change anything.

Thanks,
Kate
