FYI.  I believe we need your help with preparing the first two breakout 
contracts - one for the City of Austin project, and one for the ESA project.  
I heard yesterday that they want the ESA contract by November 22, and the COA 
shortly thereafter.

I expect to talk to Kent today about where we are on the form, and how to 
move forward to closure.

Ben,

Has the payment allocation chart been updated, and if so, could I get a copy?

Thanks,

Kay
