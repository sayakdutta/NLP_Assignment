I tried to figure out how to print the whole thing, but failed.  Did she 
figure out how to print the entire document?  It really has a lot of 
information on it.

Thanks for the update.  Sorry for the confusion over the turbine numbers
and delivery dates.  The spreadsheet my secretary printed out only had
the amounts due, but I see that when I open it on the screen, I can see
the turbines, due dates, etc.






I just spoke with GE's counsel, and here's where we are:

Change the following for the final draft:
1.80  delete "remaining"
10.2.1  take out the note

Otherwise, GE had no comments.

Peter/Chris,

If you look on the spreadsheet I sent you earlier, it gives the unit
numbers for each of the projects.  You can figure out the guaranteed
delivery dates by matching up the delivery dates from the contracts with
the number.  Also, please fix the use of purchase amount in 10.10.6 as
suggested by Dale.

The ESA deal has a change order associated with it (change order 3,
attached below) and that CO is not reflected in the amounts to be paid.

(See attached file: Change Order #3.doc)

City of Austin has no change orders.  The assignee is Enron South
America.


Thanks,

Kay
