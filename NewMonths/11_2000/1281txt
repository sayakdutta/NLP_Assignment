Please join me in congratulating Kate on her new position at the Deal Control 
desk. She will make the change from Origination to Trading effective 
Wednesday, Nov. 8. We wish her success in the endeavor, even as we are beside 
ourselves at such a loss.

Our new clerk, Theresa Villeggiante, will join the ranks on Thursday. In the 
meantime, please try to ween yourselves away from using Kate's services. 
Direct all requests and assignments to your respective Administrative 
Assistant.  This will help us keep track of tasks and complete them in a 
timely manner.  

Thanks for your help and congratulations, Kate!

Mollie
