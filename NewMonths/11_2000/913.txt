Mike,  Still working on it.  Should have a draft by late Monday or Tuesday.  
Sorry about the delay.

Hi Gerald,
 where are we with regards to the TPA & Registration agreements?  we have a 
demo scheduled for 11/14 and it would be nice to have those posted on the 
website.

thanks,   mve 



Mike, I reviewed the pages to the site you provided.  My only comment right 
now is that the correct name of the pipeline is "Houston Pipe Line Company". 
Note the Pipe Line is two words.  Everything else looks fine.  We will be 
getting back with you on the site access agreement.
