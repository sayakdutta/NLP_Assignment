I will need to ring you...no plans to travel anytime soon to the 
States...please just give me a time that works for you - I will be in BA all 
week.  Late today or tomorrow would be great.  

The South American team is traveling up to give their dog-and-pony tomorrow.

Thanks,
jf

Come by.  I'll shed some light....also I'd like to talk to you about 
opportunities within EGM.  Jeff

Will you be around this week?  I need to start thinking seriously about what 
to do next...though I still have to take that vacation you suggested.  

Some parts of this reorg baffle me...

Hope all is going well.
