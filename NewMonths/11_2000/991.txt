Please be advised that I have scheduled the above referenced meeting as 
follows:

Time: 10:30am - 3:30pm Pacific
Where: San Francisco Office

Most of you "penciled in" this appointment when I spoke to you, please make 
plans to attend!!

At this time, Paul would prefer to keep this as an internal GA meeting with 
our outside lobbyists.  At this time we are not inviting the Enron Business 
units to attend, but please feel free to invite anyone else in the GA group 
you feel should attend.  HOWEVER, if you invite someone else, please advise 
me so that we can ensure we have adequate space in San Francisco to 
accommodate everyone.  Thanks!

Melissa Cortez - please forward to Scott AND Hedy.

Jim Steffes & Marcia Linton - I am aware that Jim is on vacation the week of 
the 27th.  In the event that he can participate via teleconference, I will 
forward a dial in number by the end of the week.
