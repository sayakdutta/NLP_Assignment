Not wanting to duplicate any efforts, I think Laurie Meyer, a paralegal in 
Alan Aronowitz's group, is going to send me copies of the Australian ISDA's 
when they come in.  Thanks for the offer!

Tana,
Do you need copies of the Australia ISDAs?  I just sent copies to the London 
office and have the copies I kept here in Houston if you need them.  

Thanks,
Jana Morse
