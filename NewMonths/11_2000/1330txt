I looked through the exhibit package that you sent me.  I have highlighted 
the exhibits that believe that  we definitely need.  I also listed some other 
potential exhibits.  What are your thoughts on our specific requirements?

Exhibit A (Purchase Amount)--I assume that we need this schedule.
Exhibit A-1 (Contractors Affidavit)--Do we need?
Exhibit A-2 (Lien Waiver)--Do we need?
Exhibit B (Work Schedule)--I assume that we don't need this Exhibit as the 
schedule is to be agreed?

similar to the scope division document that we have exchanged with FCE
Exhibit C-1 (Contractor Clarifications)--Do we need this exhibit?
Exhibit C-2 (Unit Scope of Supply)--Can this document be combined with the 
specifications?
Exhibit C-3 (Training)--I assume that we need this schedule?
