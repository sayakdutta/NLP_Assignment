Congratulations, I can tell you are very excited about this.  Speaking of 
digging, on Thursday, they had a crew in our neighborhood digging to lay 
fiber-optic cable,  they hit a sewer line and then the gas line and blew up 2 
houses.  I walked over there yesterday,  one house is completely gone, the 
house next door is only half there and the houses across the street are all 
boarded up because they blew the windows out of it.  Such excitement.  Thank 
God no one was killed.
