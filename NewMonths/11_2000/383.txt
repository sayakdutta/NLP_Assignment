Susan,

 Please review the following guaranty sent to us by Peoples Energy Corp 
(PEC).  PEC and ENA will each guaranty 50% of the obligations of Enovate ( I 
think the guaranty may have a different name- I'll fix it).

 Please review and let me know if it is acceptable or make necessary changes.

Thanks,
Ted
