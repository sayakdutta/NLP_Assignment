I have been in touch with Mr.  Woodford today.   This is my first day back 
from Turkey Day vacation.  The dogs are good.  I packed them up and drove 9 
hours to Ark to visit the folks.  Geronimo was very good.  I was surprised, 
although he was a little much for my Dad.   

How is the baby?  Have you adjusted?  Have the dogs adjusted?  

The luncheon was just OK.  I thought last year was better with regards to 
food and clothes.  River Oaks CC did not live up to the Junior League in my 
opinion.
