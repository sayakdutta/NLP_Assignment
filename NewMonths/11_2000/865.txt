Greetings Wayne:

Sorry that I missed the last meeting.  I'll be attending by phone this week, 
but would like to attend in person as often as I can (understanding that our 
meetings will be weekly).  Now don't shoot me, but I was wondering if it 
might be possible to have the meetings on Thursday mornings.  That way I 
could actually be in Houston for the meetings (which my schedule doesn't 
permit me to do on Wednesdays).  If it's too complicated, don't sweat it; I 
can continue to do the meetings by phone.  But if Thursdays can fit into 
folks' schedule, that would be great.  Thanks and talk to you on Wednesday.

Best,
Jeff
