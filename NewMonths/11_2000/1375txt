When I run a CompareRite redline I get a different number of changes, so I 
was unclear as to the compared documents.

The comparison was run against the last version you sent to FuelCell on the
2nd of November.   





Please confirm the version of the document which was the basis of the
compared version.

Thank you,

Kay
