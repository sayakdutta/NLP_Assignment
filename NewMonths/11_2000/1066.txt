Sheri Cromwell and I will be sorting through the binders that were left in 
the Houston Room after the conference.  If you left your binder on the table 
and never got it back, please let me know immediately if you need one.  We 
are in the process of cleaning up all the extras as we do not have the room 
to store this material.

Again, please let me know as soon as possible!
