I was alerted this morning to the urgency with which certain people in the 
Portland office need this information; so I think it might help if they were 
added to the e-mail list for name change/merger notifications. Following is 
the list of Portland West Desk employees to add:

Kate Symes
Carla Hoffman
Jeff Richter
Chris Mallory
Phillip Platter
Jeremy Morris

Thank you so much for your help.
