PLEASE call me Jeff.  When I'm old, grey, and heavier, then you call use a 
more formal salutation.  
Great to meet you too, and I'll be in touch shortly.

Jeff







Dear Mr. Shankman,

    Thanks again for meeting with me on Friday.  I appreciated meeting
you in person and look forward to working with you this summer in
Houston.  As per your request, I have attached a copy of my most current
resume. Have a great day.

Best Regards, Dan
