I think you know about this....  On another note, I have 5 cases of Kistler 
in my office--should we crack a few?

Doug - I was out on paternity leave and did not get this message until now.  
The DC lobbyist for NYMEX is Mark Seetin, however I think the problem is 
Rappaport himself (see e-mail to Capitol Hill below).  Call after you get a 
chance to review.


____________________Forward Header_____________________


I'm forwarding a communication sent at the direction of NYMEX regarding
the CEA legislation.  This truly is an unbelievable process.

Mark Seetin


NYMEX Chairman Dan Rappaport has asked me to convey, on behalf of the
Board of Directors, our strong opposition to the passage of H.R. 4541
with the current energy exemption provision.

This provision is anti-competitive, anti-consumer and is bad for the
marketplace.  If the proponents of this provision were truly in favor of
competition, at the very least, they would not have opposed extending
the same regulatory treatment to open outcry markets.  Their opposition
to such regulatory equity speaks volume about what may be the true
intent--use government and legislation in a perverse way to thwart
competition and allow them a government sanctioned license to hijack a
market, without even having to compete for it.

Please do not allow this bill to go forward without a closer examination
and discussion of this unwise provision.

If you have any questions, Chairman Rappaport may be reached at (212)
299-2250, My telephone number is (202) 662-8770.

Would you please update us on the status of your discussion on behalf of
Senator Gramm, and the overall status of the bill?

Thanks in advance for your help.

Mark Seetin

Chris,

I was in a meeting today with Jeff Shankman and he was interested in who in 
the NYMEX was behind their efforts in DC to cause EOL problems. I told him 
the Enron DC office was pleased with the initial federal government comments 
regarding protection for EOL from the NYMEX's stance. He still wanted to know 
who at the NYMEX was causing Enron grief. You may respond directly to him if 
you wish, but please let me know that you have responded to Jeff so I can 
consider my request closed. 

Thanks,
Doug
