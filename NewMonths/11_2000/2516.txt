Tana,

As you may already be aware, Georgi Landau has joined our group as the new 
backup for Financial.  As I am transitioning from this responsiblility, I am 
assisting Anthony with getting her the appropriate tools needed to complete 
her new responsibilities.  

One of the tools that she will be needing is the Financial Trading Database.  
Before I forward this email to Georgi so that she can access the Financial 
Trading Database, I wanted to make sure that this link is the most current 
one and that is was ok to do so.   Please let me know if it is the correct 
link and if it ok to forward to Georgi.

Regards,
Bridgette









Attached is the link that will allow you access to referenced database.  
Please note, that we have just upgraded the database to add the ISDA 
definitions, branch offices approved for trading, and market disruption 
provisions.  This information should be inputted for the new master swap 
agreements on a going forward basis, but we still need to go back and 
repopulate the data for the existing master swap agreements.

Also, FYI, the "See" drop down is our nickname for the name changes and 
mergers reference.  If an item is filled in for that entity it should show 
you any prior or new names for the counterparty.  

If there is anyone else who would like the link, please let me know and I 
will forward it to them.

We hope you find the information provided in this database helpful.
