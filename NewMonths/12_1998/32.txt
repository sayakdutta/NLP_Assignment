There is a master agreement in place between ECT and Koch Energy Trading, 
Inc.  I have never heard of Koch Carbon.  My immediate concern is as to the 
Enron entity.  It is not clear to me why Peter thinks this trade is between 
ECT and a Koch entity since he does not have authority to bind ECT.

Paul:

Please call me tomorrow morning Houston time to discuss our preparing a 
confirmation and other relevant documentation for this petroleum coke-based 
financial swap transaction with Koch Carbon, Inc. I understand you (and Yao) 
had worked on a similarly structured coal-based swap a few months ago.

Mark: Do we have a financial master with any Koch affiliates?
