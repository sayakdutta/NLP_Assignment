Martin:

I am told by my assistant (Jan Dobernecker) that the Human Resources 
Department here has people who will assist you on the practicalities.  Jan 
has asked them to get in touch with you directly.  If you have not heard from 
someone by the middle of next week, please let me or Jan know so we can 
either prod them into action or get you a contact name and number to call.

We are all very much looking forward to your arrival and I'd be happy to 
discuss any questions (and I'm sure there must be several) that come to mind 
- just give me a call.

Mark

Mark,

Following the message below, please be informed that I plan to come over to 
Houston 15 January next year and stay for 6-7 weeks (at Murphy's Montecito 
apartments).  Maybe we could change a few words on this before Christmas.  
Also, do you know to whom I may turn in order to settle the practicalities 
(invitation letter to show immigration authorities, insurance, car, etc.)?!

We ought to investigate the possibility of having a Wikborg lawyer over every 
afternoon, with the understanding that the Wikborg lawyer would also be 
available to work on our stuff in the morning. This is our chance to develop 
a relationship with a new Wikborg lawyer who could replace Jarle Erik. Please 
confirm the dates that you will be gone. I assume that you will be back in 
Oslo by March 1. Please co-ordinate your Houston visit with Mark Taylor. 
Thanks!
