I sent down the list for 9/27/00 on Friday.  On the 9/26/00 list, for Edison 
Mission Marketing & Trade, I am showing them as "amended-no change" becuase I 
already had them open for emissions.  Same on FPL Energy Power Marketing, I 
am showing them as "amended-no change" because I already had them opened for 
physical gas.
