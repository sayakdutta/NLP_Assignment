Hi Sheila. I just wanted to drop you a quick note inquiring on the status of
my application. I'd appreciate your advice and hopefully we can move things
along quickly for everyone's advantage.

Thanks very kindly, Ed Parks.

Thank you Sheila for taking a very generous slice of your Friday morning to
talk with me about joining Enron. I would like nothing better than to come on
board and would appreciate your guidance and assistance.

I'd be happy to meet with whomever you suggest at their earliest convenience.

Thanks again for your time and consideration.

Best regards, Ed Parks. (504) 861-3972.
