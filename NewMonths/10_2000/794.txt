Jeff,

Loren mentioned that you would be willing to forward my resume and bio along
to Enron Broadband and New Power Company.  After you have the chance to
review them, I would like to speak with you to get your feedback and a sense
of what both companies are currently planning.  Thanks in advance for your
help.

Best,

Robert
