I'm available.  As I  mentioned, I'm still working away on the revised 
equipment contract.

How does 10:00 work for everyone?  Jeff's got a meeting at 9, so he can't 
make the 9:30.

Kay,  can we use your office?  All the conference rooms are full down here.

If 10:00 works for you, I'll see you up in Kay's office.
