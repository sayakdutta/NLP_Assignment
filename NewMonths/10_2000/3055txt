Hi Dale,

I thought I'd send this along.  It is the first draft of the "break out" 
contract for the ABB transformers which go with the LM's.  I thought Sheila 
told me that your stuff is in immediate need to getting this and the LM break 
out in shape.  This has not been reviewed with ABB yet (in fact, I haven't 
read it yet), but just in case you want to give it a look, I thought I would 
pass it along.

Attached please find a clean copy of the ABB Transformer Purchase and Sale 
Agreement as well as a blackline to show changes made from the WESTLB/ABB 
Agreement.  Sorry for the delay in getting this to you. We have had to delete 
the table of contents from the clean version in order to get this to you in a 
timely fashion.  A completed version will be forthcoming sometime tomorrow.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact me at (202) 662-2780.
