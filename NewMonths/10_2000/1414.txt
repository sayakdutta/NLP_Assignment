I got your voice mail and agree with the strategy of meeting with the 
Senator's staff before sending the letter.  It would be embarrassing to 
suggest that we don't have a view on issues that should be important to us.

Re: the letter itself, if you want to make it even stronger, you could point 
out in your discussion of EnronOnline that we believe that the site could 
have been designed such that the volume of business through the site would 
have been significantly larger but for the uncertainty and restrictions in 
existing law and regulation which would be corrected by the bill.
