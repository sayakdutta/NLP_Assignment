I want to underscore that moving just the banking stuff to a bill to pass 
this year is VERY bad and something we should vehemently oppose.

Jim - The CEA legislation has died and risen again so many times over the 
last two weeks.  As of yesterday, Senator Gramm (the one obstacle to final 
passage) told a group of banking lobbyist that he opposes the legislation in 
full, but would consider moving the legal certainty provisions for banking 
swaps.  This is not good for us and it is not good for the entire 
legislation.  We are still trying to discern what exactly Gramm wants and 
what he is up to.  We should know by later today the ultimate fate of the 
bill.

I'll keep you in the loop.

Chris --

Can you give me a quick update on where we stand with CFTC Reauthorization?  

Jim
