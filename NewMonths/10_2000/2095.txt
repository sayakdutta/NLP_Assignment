This seems like something the Confirmation Desk should do, or you.  I have 
never dealt with the deal tickets before.

Can everyone meet tomorrow around 3-4pm to talk about SWAP Deals? If not 
Friday, when would be a good time on Monday? Marianne Castano would like for 
Paul to explain the Springs deal to us and have Tana show us how to transfer 
the information to a Deal Ticket form. Thanks.
