Scott:  I only have comments from Ryan and Donette.  Mark Spradling left me a 
message about five minutes ago and said that he would have comments tomorrow 
morning (and to copy Shelley Barber on any drafts).  Once I receive comments, 
I'll prepare another draft and circulate.  Sara

Sara,

Since you're out the rest of the week from noon tomorrow, we'd really 
appreciate it if you could prepare a revised confirm tomorrow morning so we 
can deliver it to LJM for their review. Then, we can hopefully sign the 
confirm on Monday. Thanks!

Here are comments from transaction support group on the LDC swap.  I have 
marked my changes against a clean version of the latest swap.



Regards,

Ryan
