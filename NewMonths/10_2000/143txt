I am coming in on a United Flight 7954 that leaves LA at 3:15 and arrives San 
Diego at 4:04.  Staying at theHyatt Islandia in Mission Bay.  Look forward to 
seeing you even if it is for a short time.  I'm leaving for Vail tomorrow 
afternoon-so if you have any questions I'll get back to you on Monday.
