you hate gollata huh?  fights are a waste of money b/c they are never good.  
i made my mullet wig.  it is a work of art.  i look like such a tool with it 
on, but my legs are still great.  i like my ankles too.  so you are just 
going to hit that party sat?  what else have you heard that might be going 
on?  i love halloween.  it is a lot of fun dressing up and getting drunk.  
let me know what you hear of.
