Sherri,

Thanks for trying. I shall recommend to UT that they should invite
Greg Whalley or Lou Pai.

Vince, Jeff has decided to decline this speaking opportunity.  He is 
scheduled to speak at a Leadership conference at UT on 2/16, so given his 
time limitations, he wants to pass on this one.  Sorry to be the messenger of 
bad news.  SRS

Sherri,

Any resolution of the scheduling conflict Jeff Skilling had for February the 
22nd?
Our friends at UT are ready to make the reservations and send out invitations
to this conference

Rick / Vince:

Good morning.

Further to my discussions with Vince during his visit to the Energy Finance
Program yesterday, I write at this time to inquire whether Mr. Skilling's
assistant has been able to confirm his participation as 2/22/2001 keynote
speaker at our Conference.

With thanks for your intercession on our behalf,
Ehud Ronn
