Hi, Beek.

I'm going through all of your e-mails to Jeff and am not able to find the 
information on Elvis' party Friday night.  Someone had sent an attachment 
with the details, but I was unable to open it.  Would you mind sending us the 
"final" agenda for the festivities this weekend?  Jeff will arrive in Dallas 
+/- 4:00p Friday night and will be staying at the Crescent Court hotel.  
Thanks so much!  SRS
