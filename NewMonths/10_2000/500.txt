Ron,

Hello.  I am back in the country -  I've been out for 2 weeks since I picked 
up the car.  I am very happy with the car and your contact treated me very 
well.  The transaction went smoothly and they worked with me to get the car 
before I went off to Asia.

I wanted to thank you again for all your help and efforts.   I have had many 
comments already and there is not doubt that this will lead to a new wave of 
Enron purchases of Mercedes.

 I am a Mercedes believer.

Sincerely,
Mike McConnell
