Chad -- Good to see you the other day.  Please give me a call when you return 
to your office.  I am embarrassed to say that I am not sure I have the right 
version of the Operating Agreement we sent you in March...if we can compare 
notes, I can make sure I get the correct one to you without further delay.

Thank you!
