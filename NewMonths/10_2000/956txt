This is another reason why the HR and A/A program don't like each other.  
It's absurd that our personnell functions don't share resources.  I'm almost 
of the opinion that these two groups should be folded together.

Kate Wagner (Thunderbird) was supposed to have been taken off this list

The list was also supposed to have been updated 2 months ago to reflect that 
Neville Ravji, Tiffany Wright, and Ben Creighton have left the company.
Betsy Bassis and Steve Pirozzi are physically located in London.

Are you sure you're pulling from the most up-to-date list?

Hello Wharton/Penn Team!


Can you believe interviews are just around the corner.  



So that we are fully prepared for the November 9th and 10th interviews dates 
a team meeting will be held on:

Monday October 9th at 2:00pm in room 11C2

In the meeting we will review resumes that have been received for our 
pre-select list and coordinate any further campus events. Also, in the 
meeting we will select the people who will conduct first and second round
