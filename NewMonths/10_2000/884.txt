Hi Ben,

No problem if you want to invoice me.  I'm not ready for you to ship the 
goods to me, though, and probably won't be for a few weeks, as I move into 
the new digs.  Still thinking about the lamp and desk.....

Best,

Jeff







the dragonfly table (I already sold the other one), the pair of Guimard
pots, and the Robalbhen ceramic apple.  Also on the list:
1. Galle "saggitaire" tri-cornered table, which has been sold (blame my dad)
2. the Tiffany lotus bell lamp, which was 59,000 and we told you 52.
3. The very tall Rozenburg iris vase, which was 14,000 and we told you 12.
4. The Rozenburg with 2 butterflies that looks like Gustav Klimt, $6,500 to
$5,750.
5. The Mougin ceramic of 3 mice and a bug, 1,950-1,700
6. The Galle desk that has waited for you 95-79 and that's a lot of love.

what do you think?

Dear Jeff:

Hello! I wanted to make a bill for you for  the table and ceramic pieces,
is that ok?


Can you be in Washington on October 28?   There's a great day-long
symposium in conjunction with the Art Nouveau show  (which I saw on Friday,
and which is, incidentally, much bigger and better than  the one in London
was) which I'm going to, and I would love to be able to tour  around the
show with you. Also, Macklowe Gallery is having a cocktail  party that
night for our clients, friends, experts, and assorted fabulous  hangers-on.
You'll get an invite in the mail, but I wanted to give  you advance notice
since I know how hectic your schedule is.

I hope it was an easy and meaningful fast for you,  and that this year
brings you happiness beyond your wildest  imagination.
Tell me what's up
love.
ben
