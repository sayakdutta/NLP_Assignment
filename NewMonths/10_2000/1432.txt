The confirm form is one of the many current templates used by the confirm 
desk depending on the specific transaction type and the counterparty.  For 
instance, this template is not the used for a swap (e.g. not a cap, floor, 
collar or swaption) and would not be used even for a plain vanilla swap if 
the customer had not signed an ISDA Master Agreement.  The index language can 
be used in a variety of contexts but again depends on exactly which type of 
trade you are doing.  But I thought you guys had decided to use the first 
price published in the following month rather than the average of the entire 
month language attached so this may not be the final version.

Here is the confirm template (used when an ISDA Master is in place)


This is the index language for EnronOnline.  We would use something similar 
for the offline confirms.
