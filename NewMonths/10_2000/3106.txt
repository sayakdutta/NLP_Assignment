Thanks.  This is a  very drastic situation, so the draft will be 
appreciated.  

As I recall you were going to turn another draft of the GE facility 
agreement, deleting the WestLB references.  When will this be forthcoming?

Thanks,

Kay







Peter Thompson is working on it.  We should have a draft Wednesday.  Regards,

Paul,

When can we expect a draft of the ABB facility agreement? It is getting
urgent.

Thanks,

Kay
