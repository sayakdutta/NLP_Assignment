Please see the attached currency description for USD/JPY and EUR/USD. Unlike
the USD/CAD par forwards, these products are very straighforward - they are
simple exchanges of currencies at a specific rate on a specific date. For
example, the counterparty agrees to pay USD and receive JPY at 107.00 for
10/31/00. Just a simple forward transaction for internal counterparties
only.

Sara, please review/modify. Our goal is to have these approved so that they
can be added to EOL on Monday or Tuesday of next week.

Thanks,

Stuart
