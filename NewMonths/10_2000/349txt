Many of the customers have requested that we fax them the filing, so I am 
planning on providing them with courtesy copies.  


   
	
	
		




It's been signed and ready to be shipped to DC for filing tomorrow.  good 
job--
Are you guys calling some of the Tw customers to tell them its being made and 
should we have a copy delivered to anyone specically at FERC??  MK
