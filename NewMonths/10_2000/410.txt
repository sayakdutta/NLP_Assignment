Janice:

After his trip to Singapore, Mike McConnell recently requested that Bob 
Williams (and possibly Mary Nell Browning) get up-to-speed on the First Gas 
contract issues to see if Bob can help in any way. As you may recall,  Bob 
(and Mary Nell) had assisted Mike on the J-Block contract litigation and 
settlement.

Bob has set up this call to get some background. Matt has prepared a note on 
the background, which I have forwarded to Bob. Matt has also prepared a 
package for Bob, which is supposed to arrive by courier in the next few days. 
I will forward Matt's note to you as well.

Thanks in advance for your participation in this matter.

Alan
