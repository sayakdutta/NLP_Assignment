This refers to settlement or payment netting only, not close out 
netting....correct?
If so, we can probably live with it.

I spoke with Steve Kessler this morning.  He told me that he agreed with 
Carol to net commodity transactions (which was actually more than he wanted 
to agree to!).  However, DB does not have the systems to net within other 
product groups.  Sara
