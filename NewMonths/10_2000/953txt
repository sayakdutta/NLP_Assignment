It's not necessarily an either/or decision.  Michelle, do you think this is a 
good program?  Kristin, can you call Tom Piazze at Wharton, and ask him what 
he thinks about the importance of our participation in this?

Here is another conference we can participate in.  Would you rather do this 
conference or the entrepreneurship conference?

Hi Kristin

I am following up on our conversation earlier with respect to Enron
participating in the Whartons Finance conference and the evening
reception known as Bullish on Finance.

I think this forum will be a great opprotunity for Enron to reach
the students interested in finance and it also provides a great platform
to talk about Enrons unique position in the global financial
community.

Please do consider the option of sponsoring a panel at the Gold level.
It provides a great value and essentially a full panel "ownership" to
talk about Enrons acitivities.

I would like to touch base with you early next week to hear you thoughts
and feedback on these proposals.

Looking forward to a great conference participation.

Kind Regards
Suresh
