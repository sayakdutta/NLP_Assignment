Mahesh:

I have a question that needs to be answered on Wednesday morning:

 What company actually employs John Greene?

I am now being told by Instinet that the company employing the trader must 
sign a new confidentiality agreement for the UK terminal (for trading by ECT 
Investments, Inc. through its arranger Enron Investment Services Limited).  
Please advise by email or voice mail

Thanks  Sara

Apologies - I have been out of the office for the past 10 days.

I had asked Cindy in legal to provide you with signature blocks when you 
first asked for it - I will chase her again today.
I will call you this afternoon to discuss the status of the agency agreement 
and any other requirement that you may have - let me know when you are 
available.

Regards
Mahesh





I am still waiting for a copy of the services agreement and the form of 
signature.  Instinet is proceeding but will still require this information.  
Thanks.  Sara
