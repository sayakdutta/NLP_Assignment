Roxanne,

Thank you for calling last night. We took Michael out for dinner to celebrate 
his first day at SF, and missed your call. Michael had a great first day.  
All the kids drew portraits of him, and he got a big kick out of it.

I noticed on the class list that you live in Spring Valley.  We live on 
Inverness Park Way, and used to live on Cedarspur a few years back.  It is 
nice to know that Michael has a classmate in the neighborhood.

Again, thanks for calling.

Kay
