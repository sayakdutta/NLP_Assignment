Sara is a good friend.  I missed the trip due to the birth of my second 
daughter, but I should be able to make it for the interviews later this fall.

Hi Jeff,

Thank you so much for coming last Friday and speaking to the students about 
resumes - and everything else!  I think your story was an extremely valuable 
one.  It is good for the students to hear that there is a life outside Wall 
Street, and that their desire for challenge and stimulation can be more than 
fulfilled outside of New York.  It is also good for them to hear that there 
is not one answer to any particular question, and I appreciated that you and 
all of your colleagues pushed back when they pressed you for THE ANSWER.  All 
of us at MBA Career Management can say that until we're blue in the face, but 
when you speak they listen.

Thank you once again for participating.  And please pass on my best regards 
to Evan Betzer.

Best regards,

Sara Simons
MBA Career Management
