So I met him for dinner Thursday night.  Nothing was discussed until we were 
about to leave and I couldn't hold my tongue any longer.  Turns out he was 
married before and may have some issues (pretty big ones in my opinion - case 
in point, he's been divorced three years and, by his own admission, has dated 
quite a bit in the interim but nothing that has lasted longer than 2 mos. - 
sounds like a pattern to me). 

 We'll talk more later,
