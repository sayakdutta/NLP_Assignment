Michael is still running 102 fever.  I spoke to the doctor again today, and 
he said that Michael had a pretty good bit of strep.  I'm feeling better, 
though, and have gotten a decent amount of work done.  In fact, Christy 
Chapman may give you some original documents I initialled and faxed to her.  
I'll explain later.  If I had your fax number I think I would have faxed them 
to you.

Have a great day tomorrow.

Kay


   
	
	
		



Not yet.  Karen called me after I sent her my e-mail regarding the several 
missing items and she assured me she would take care of the acknowledgments.  
I did not want to mention it in my e-mail to her yesterday (thought I would 
save that until I had a chance to see if she sent anything to Fred and he is 
out of town).  I have not forgotten about it though.

How are you and handsome doing?  Feeling any better?  I talked to your other 
son "Carlos" today and he was thinking about leaving early to go home 
(something he ate yesterday at Massa's).

By the way, did they ever get the acknowledgments taken care of?
