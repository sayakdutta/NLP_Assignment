it was just in case, at more or less no cost, you wanted to have a report on 
the ship (remind you i am holding a master and chief engineer certificate)

If you think there is value to your seeing the ship, I'm ok with your 
detour.  Let me know before you go what you intend to find out if anything.

Regards
