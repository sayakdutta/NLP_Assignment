Bill:  To my knowledge, Enron Corp. has never provided a "true comfort 
letter" in these situations.  ENE has written a vague letter of ENE's 
relationship to its sub.  It is possible that the current ENE corporate 
viewpoint on providing "comfort letters" has changed.  Let me know what you 
would like for me to do.  SS

Sara,

John Glotzbach at Prudential (312-588-5613) has been calling me for credit 
support to back futures trading for oil, gas and financial trading.  I am not 
aware of where our broker agreements stand but it is my understanding that we 
will provide a letter of comfort from Enron Corp backing ENA and not a 
guaranty.  Has this position changed?

Let me know.

Thanks,
Bill
