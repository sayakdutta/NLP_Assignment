Richard:
I am a Sr. Legal Specialist currently with CALME- Enron Caribbean Basin Legal 
Group (I report to Frank Sayre) and due to the circumstances affecting this 
business unit, am looking for another position.  I ran into Janet Moore the 
other day and she suggested that I send you my C.V.  Thus, I enclose a copy 
of my C.V. and List of Accomplishments with Enron for your review and 
consideration.  I believe that Frank Sayre has been having some discussions 
with Mark Haedicke to place some of his people.   Should you need further 
information,  I can be contacted at  ext. 6-8688.  Thank you for your time.

Regards,
Denise G. Almo?na
