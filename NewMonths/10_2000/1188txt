please prepare a transmittal letter to Heather for me to sign.

Thanks,

Kay,

As I said in my voice mail, please print out executable copies of the CRRA 
LOU with your CKM initial.  We are going to see Bob Wright tomorrow and if he 
has no further changes we can get the documents signed.

Please FedEx them to our attorney's office in Hartford:

Heather Kroll/Jeff Ader
c/o Paul McCary
Murtha, Cullina, Richter and Pinney
Cityplace I
185 Asylum Street
Hartford, CT  06103-3469

860.240.6037

We'll be there by 11:00 (enough time to sleep in a little bit), so 10:00 
delivery is perfect.

Also, if you will send the fuel cell document to swanita_99, I will make sure 
I download it and review before seeing Jerry tomorrow night.

Thanks!  Call me on my cell if you need anything.

I'll let you know if anything interesting happens at The Mark Bar or on 
Channel 35 (gotta' love PBS).

Heather
