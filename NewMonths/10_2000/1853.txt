what is going on?  i have missed some good games.  i wanted to go in last 
week, but i was out of town and didn't get in until late fri night.  i think 
i will be in for the bama game.  how old is your friend that is getting 
married?  a lot of my friends are starting to get engaged.  i can't believe 
everyone gets hitched so young.  what else is new?
