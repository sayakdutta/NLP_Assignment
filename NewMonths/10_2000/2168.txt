Jason:  She did call and wanted John, you and me.  I am available untill 
roughly 11 am when the lawyers depart for the Woodlands.  She indicated that 
this provision was necessary if we EVER decided to net physical/financial.  
(Jason:  we won't agree to that now and if we ever did, I am sure we would 
either amend all of our masters or put a separate netting agreement in 
place).  She did indicate that Harvard MIGHT drop the request.  I don't  
particularly want the provision in the agreement.   My calendar is open if 
you want to schedule.  SS

Sara,

Kim Noble called.  She was hoping that we could talk in the morning.  She 
indicated that anything before 10:00 AM worked for her.  I told her I would 
pass it on.

Jason
