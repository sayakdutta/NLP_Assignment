It's no surprise to me to find Reggie's been stirring it up!

You are both wrong, it is Reggie's fault, he told me not to hang around 
either of you!!!!!

Yeh, you're right.  It is her fault.  In the past, she always had plans and 
couldn't (or just didn't want to) go with us.  I guess that's the price you 
pay for being so popular and in demand.

It's really all Genia's fault, she goes to lunch too darn early.  I guess we 
need to make a date beforehand for lunch with you...!

Hey, I was an invited guest.  It wasn't my party!  Sounds like someone is 
trying to weasel herself out of trouble.
