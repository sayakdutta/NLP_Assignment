I'm sorry.  Things are so busy that I grabbed an old list that I thought 
everyone was on.  You are most welcome indeed.  My office (101 Cal, Suite 
1950, from 10 am to noon).


Best,
Jeff

     I heard a rumor that you were putting together a study group on 
     Finance this weekend.  True?  Open to all?  I am going to attend the 
     GSI section on Saturday, but could probably use some additional group 
     study time, if that's an option.
     
     Thanks,
     Carolyn
