 Attached for your approval is the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty in favor of 
Engage Energy US, L.P., now known as Coastal Merchant Energy, L.P., which 
guarantees the obligations of ENA under an  ISDA Master Agreement.  We will 
need the standard executed copy.  This guaranty will supersede and replace, 
in part, the prior guaranty with respect to ENA and Counterparty.  The 
guaranty will be fully replaced when counterparty receives the new Enron 
Corp. Guaranty with respect to the obligations of Enron Canada and Engage 
Canada (still covered under the existing guaranty, and such replacement is 
still under negotiation).

 Upon approval and execution, please call me at x33399 to pick up the 
documents.  Thank you for your assistance in this matter.
