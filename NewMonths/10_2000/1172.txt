I'm thinking you don't have anything to move.  Maybe it would help if you 
acknowledged that ENA might not be your final destination, but seems like a 
good place to get exposed to a variety of opportunites, such as Enron Global 
Markets and Enron Industrial Markets - both new businesses with international 
aspects. Plus, lawyers at ENA move between groups without much fuss and 
bother (if it changes, don't blame me later!)

How does that sound?

My deductive reasoning leads me think that JS's reaction was based on his
marine motto of being semper fei and thus feels that he has an obligation
to Vicki to present her with the opportunity of recruiting me first.
Anyway, I guess I should be flattered that I am such a coveted asset.  I'm
thinking that my next step tomorrow needs to be able to convey the message
to John that in visiting with Vicki, my interview season starts and based
on that, I'd like to be able to explore all opportunities where I have
leads (EES and ENA) and then make a decision based on what "offers" I
receive, rather than limiting myself to just one interview and wondering
what if.  It's a bit like a pushing a rock, you can only move so much each
day.  Today he was the one who opened the opportunity to discuss this
topic, so tomorrow can the opportunity to get what I've been wanting since
June.  So what do you think?
