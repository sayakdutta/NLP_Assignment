Dear FT.com User

Your FT.com mailing  preferences are currently set to receive email
updates from us about FT.com and other FT group products or services.

To comply with our obligations under UK data protection legislation,
we are giving you this opportunity to update your privacy preferences.
We are now also giving you the option to receive email communications
from other organisations about products and services offered by them
or offered jointly with the FT group.

If you DO NOT wish to be contacted for this reason, please visit

http://registration.ft.com/registration/editRegistrationDetails.jsp

and tick box C.  You may also use this link to edit or update any of the
information currently held on your registration record.

To access your personal record, you will be required to input your FT.com
username and password.

Your current username is: vincentkaminski

For security reasons we have not included your password, but if you visit:

http://registration.ft.com/registration/passwordLookup.jsp

and supply the user name and e-mail address with which you originally
registered, it will be emailed directly to you.

If we do not hear from you we will assume that you do not wish to change your
present preferences and that you have no objection to receiving carefully
selected offers and information from other organisations.  You can of course
edit your registration profile at any time by clicking on the Edit Your 
Profile
link on the FT.com homepage.

If you have any queries, please e-mail our Customer Services Team on

update.
