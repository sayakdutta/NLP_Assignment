I think Piazza sped up to try to get close to the bat.  He's a sly one.  
Roger's first story was ok ("I didn't think he was running, I was tossing the 
bat to our bat boy").  Second version was a little iffy ("I didn't know if I 
had the bat or the ball" - why the hell would he throw the ball towards the 
dugout?)

The Turner wedding was amazing.  Jim and Betty Boyd sat behind us at the 
wedding. Mauricio and his wife were there, and showed no signs of leaving.  
When Neil and I left at 130 (Michael was with grandparents)  the band was 
still playing, and the bride and groom were still there.  Unbelievable.  I 
wonder how late it went.

I'm out of town this weekend - Neil's officer's meeting at the Hyatt Hill 
Country, then up to see Paige on Saturday, back on Sunday.  Let me know if it 
reschedules.

Did you change jobs?

What do you hear from Ben?  Anthony called me last week, just to chat.  They 
are looking forward to hunting before the baby gets here.

How are you?  Catherine is trying to get you, Honey, Pam, and me
together this Sunday - brunch to look at the pics I took at Dawn's
wedding.
Are you available?
 I had such a great time in New Orleans.  Drove over Fri the 13th.  No
sweat either way.
 Mrs T told me Turner's wedding was a spectacular.
Hey - tell that St. Francis boy of yours - Roger - to quit throwing
broken bats!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Let me know.
