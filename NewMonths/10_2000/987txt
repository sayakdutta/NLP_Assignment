At our LNG coordination meeting in London last Friday, I asked Doug Arnell to 
be the point person tocoordinate the assembly of a quick data base of all of 
our LNG sources and uses and ship availability over the next several years.  
He will work with Merritt Thomas, Brad Hitch and Eric Groves and will 
coordinate all of his work with Eric Gonzales.

The purpose of this exercise is to give us, in light of the fact that we do 
not have an operational LNG book,  a quick picture of the overall situation 
so that we can make some quick calls on Hoegh Galleon, Abu Dhabi etc.

I have noted that Doug has since started copying the two of you on lots of 
emails.  I will ask him to take the two of you out of the details on this for 
now so that we don't overload your email inboxes, unless you want to see all 
of the details.

I will screen the emails and forward you info to keep you in the loop but at 
a higher altitude without all of the gory details.

Please advise
