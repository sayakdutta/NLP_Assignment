The e-mail should suffice as an official policy. Let me know if you need 
anything more.

Richard,

Will there be an official amendment to the retention policy or should we use 
this email as our documentation?

Thanks,  Robert


   
	
	
		



Will there be an official amendment to the current tape policy?

Have/are you implementing a document which the head trader and legal counsel 
can fill out and sign to request call be retained and for what period it is 
to be obtained? If so, can Mike and I get a copy of it?

Thanks!

Effective October 15, 2000, the retention period on tape recordings of trades 
done by telephone will be reduced from four months to one month.  The tapes 
regarding significant transactions may be retained for such longer period as 
approved in writing by both the Head Trader and the General Counsel.  Please 
propose those significant transactions on which you may wish to retain the 
tapes, prior to October 15, 2000, since the tapes on conversations older than 
one month (except with respect to litigation matters) will be destroyed on 
that date.  If you have any questions, please contact Mark Haedicke or 
Richard Sanders. 

John Lavorato and Mark Haedicke
