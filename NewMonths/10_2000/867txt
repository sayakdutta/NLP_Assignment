It is with great pleasure that I invite you to Arthur Andersen's 21st Annual 
Energy Symposium.  This year's conference will be held December 7th and 8th 
at the Westin Galleria Hotel in Houston.  Arthur Andersen is offering a 
valuable program with many of the industries top executives speaking on 
industry wide applications.

 A few weeks ago some of you may have received information regarding the 
registration process.  However, due to the level of Enron's attendance, we 
have arranged to facilitate your group's registration.  If you would like to 
register or would like more information about the Symposium, please contact 
Sabrina Whaley at 853-7696 by October 31, 2000 or forward your completed 
registration form to her at EB2355.  A copy of the Symposium agenda has been 
attached for your information.  The registration fee is $950 per person; 
however, in the past we have given Enron personnel interested in attending a 
50% discount.

We are excited about the upcoming Symposium and hope that you will be able to 
attend.
