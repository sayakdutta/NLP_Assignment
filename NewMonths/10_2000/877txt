As you know, we are preparing a new LNG brochure that will be rolled out at 
the Gastech Conference in Houston mid November.  Many of you have submitted 
comments that are hopefullyincluded herein.  Attached is the latest draft of 
the brochure text.  Please review this very carefully and submit your 
comments to Henry Means/Zdenek Gerych by Tuesday noon.  

I have scanned this and have noted at least several typos and some 
numerical/statistical errors.  AG, please check in particular the DPC/Metgas 
stuff.

Henry/Z, the purpose of this brochure is to communicate that the market is 
changing and that Enron is leading the transformation of this industry.  
However, there is a negative tone in parts of this that is a slap in the face 
to the major oil companies and the government companies particularly in the 
Mid east and Far East.  I want to get all negatives out---anything that a 
supplier could read as an insult will come back to bite us.  The message 
should be bold but positive, with no implied insults.

I look forward to reading the next draft Tuesday evening

Rick

Attached is the draft as promised. This reflects input from several members 
of the team. It is easy to read and flows well. Please review and share you 
feedback by Wed before noon ( no later, sorry). Once complete, we will 
circulate the final with your comments. I do need the name of the lawyer that 
would approve the final draft for the LNG team. 

Hope you had a good trip back.
