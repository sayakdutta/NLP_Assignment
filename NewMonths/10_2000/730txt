No thoughts on Skilling's speech.  He just needs to emphasize we are a great 
productive entrepreneurial company.  Any we're are largest energy trading and 
risk management house in the world.  It would be ok if he mentioned that I am 
a Wharton '89 undergrad and run a large part of our trading group.  Students 
like to see where successful wharton alum are in the world.  (By the way, I'm 
the lead for wharton grad and wharton/penn undergrad).  This speech he is 
giving is a great opportunity for us to recruit...

On another note, I have an idea for you.  Get on my calendar for early part 
of week after next  (I'm going to the Japan office opening, then to sydney 
and will be in the office nov. 6)  Keep a low profile on the xcelerator for a 
week.

Later,  

Jeff

greatly enjoyed our conversations today, and looking forward to more, and for 
us to tackle some interesting opportunities.
i forgot to mention that i am handling skilling's wharton speech, and 
attending with him, and i found out you were the one that started all this.
