Janette,

Attached is the memorandum regarding the North American Energy and
Developing Products Committee meeting which will be held in Houston on
October 10.  We sent this out to all the Enron contacts by fax early last
week.  In addition to Mark (Haedicke) can you let me know if there will be
other representatives from Enron attending the meeting.

Also could I ask for your assistance in locating a contact name and
phone/fax number that we should forward this invitation to at Sempra Energy.

Thank in advance for your help.

Regards,

Rosemary
