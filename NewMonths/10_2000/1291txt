You didn't know that? It's actually Mary Katherine Symes. My parents decided 
that Katherine Mary didn't sound "Catholic" enough; but they still wanted a 
daughter named Katie, so they went right ahead and called me that from the 
day I was born. Needless to say, it's added an unnecessary element of 
confusion to my life in that people are always wondering who the hell this 
"Mary Symes" person is.

Thanks for noticing, though!
