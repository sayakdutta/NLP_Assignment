I have trouble getting some of the e-mails sent to me from Buenos Aires but 
not all.  I received this one from you today, one on the 9th and one on Sept. 
25th.

If the internal address doesn't seem to work, you should probably use

I light of the fact that we have two legal documents that have to be drafted, 
finalized and approved in a matter of days I have requested Andrea take full 
responsibility and accountability for the successful management of this 
process and resulting team effort. 

For EOL Argentina implementation not to be delayed further I am requesting 
the following:

Natural Gas GTC be finalized and approved by this Friday. 

Power GTC will need all of your cooperation to work through the current 
issues and to deliver a document for presentation as a final draft by this 
Friday. Targeted submission for approval would be reserved for Monday of next 
week

Andrea will coordinate from here on. Please make yourselves available to work 
on this effort in that I do consider it one of our highest commercial 
responsibilities.

Thank you for your efforts.

MFG
