Remember when the biggest accounting issues were mark-to-market?  Ahh, the 
good old days.

Other Accounting Issues of Interest to  ENA Lawyers

FROM BARBARA GRAY AND STEVE VAN HOOSER:


We have a special treat for our Wednesday staff meeting.  Roger Ondreko, a 
senior accounting professional in ENA's Transaction Support Group, will give 
us a presentation on mark-to-market accounting and related accounting 
concepts of significance to those closing typical ENA transactions.  The 
meeting is scheduled for tomorrow, Wednesday, October 25th at 1:30 pm in 
Conference Room EB49C1.   We would like to have a big turnout for Roger.  He 
has taken the time to update his materials and to inform our group as to the 
financing options available to us.  

Please RSVP to Pat Radford (extension 39282) no later than 5:00 pm today, 
letting her know whether or not you are able to attend.
