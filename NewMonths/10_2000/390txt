I heard Daniel(?) broke his arm.  I hope that he is okay.





Are we still on for Sun night?  I will let you decide where we are going.
--somewhere near you is fine. 6- 6:30 is best. We will be with the kids.

October 8 it is.  I used the message at isbell's house to send you a
message
and erased the body.  We are going just the four of us and the kids.  Where
do you want to meet?  what time?





Yes. The re line says dinner at Johnny Isbell's house. Can the kids come?
