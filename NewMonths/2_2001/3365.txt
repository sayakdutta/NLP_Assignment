Jeff,

Got your message.  I had a long conversation yesterday with Lt. Colonel
Bill Wells who I promised to keep in the loop.  I suggested he send a
letter now indicating their support for DA but they were not prepared to
do so. I'll keep both of you updated.

If I don't speak to you have a nice weekend.

Scott
