I just spoke with Holli, and she reported that the confirmation has been 
awaiting a signature at Grant County for the past week. She said she plans to 
send it to Kim Theriot as soon as she gets it back. Let me know if that 
sounds good; otherwise, I can ask her about sending you an unsigned copy.

Thanks,
Kate


   
	
	
		



Did you receive the executed copy of this deal there in your office?  We do 
not show that we have received an executed copy of this confirmation from the 
counterparty.  If you do not have the executed copy of the deal, please send 
me the copy you faxed to the counterparty and we will send it again and try 
to get it executed.

Thanks!

Sharen,
I saw that there was a note on this deal that Legal prepared the confirmation 
and Holli Krebs sent it to the counterparty herself.  Can you obtain a copy 
of what they sent for our files.  There is nothing in Livelink and if we 
would ever need to reproduce the document we would have nothing.  Also, it 
shows that it has not been singned unless Portland has a signed copy.

Kim
