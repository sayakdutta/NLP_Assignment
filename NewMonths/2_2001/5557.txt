In our previous dealings, the counterparty never responded to the proposed 
EEI Master Energy Purchase and Sale Agreements.  Concepts like margining were 
not understood and there was even a case whereby we tried to margin them and 
they failed to post.  Jim Delany at ENE has tried to reignite the EEI 
discussions, but I'm not very interested until I get their comments to our 
original EEI.  Let me know if I can be of assistance.






Ed & Brant:

I'm being hounded by ENE but no Enron traders seem interested.  Brant 
prepared a new worksheet based upon which we sent a new ISDA.  ENE 
"represents" four municipal utilities and is trying to negotiate ISDA's on 
behalf of those utilities.  I think the agent is off-base and I'm not sure 
that any of the utilities really want to trade financial.

Ed, Shari suggested that you may have some insight into ENE.  Should I drop 
this one altogether?  Or are we interested in pursuing?

Either Ed or Brant please let me know.  Thanks.
