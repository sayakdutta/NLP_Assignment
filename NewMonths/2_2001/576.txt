I just got out of a meeting and read your e-mails. I have no idea why she 
would have used this counterparty name, but looks like it's all taken care 
of. Let me know if you need anything further on this.

Carla Hoffman put a deal under an inactivated CP.  Can you check it out.  We 
should not be using inactivated CPs, and its an east CP.  Thanks for your 
help.
