 [Travella, Dee]  The swap party is First Union National Bank.
"First Union National Bank, Charlotte" is not a legal entity.  If S&P is
including the city where we are headquartered as part of our legal name,
they are incorrect.  Is it possible for you to forward the S&P document that
you are referring to and I will have our corporate relations people look
into it.

 [Travella, Dee]  First Union National Bank doesn't prepare annual
statements.  We can provide quarterly call reports (with year-to-date
information), which is also available on the FDIC page (www.fdic.gov). First
Union Corporation's annual financial statements are available on EDGAR and
First Union Corporation's home page (First Union National Bank is a
principal subsidiary).
