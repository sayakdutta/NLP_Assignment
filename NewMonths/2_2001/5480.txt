Sara,

I didn't save the attached before forwarding it to you.  So you may have 
still gotten the old amount.  In any event, here is the sheet.

I have spoken with Matthew Carnwath.  I have explained the meanings of the 
various thresholds.  Sara, it appears that I made an error in calculating the 
cross default threshold for the c/p.  Please raise it from $10MM to $15MM in 
the executable version.  For your reference, I have enclosed another credit 
worksheet incorporating that change.  Otherwise, there appear to be no 
remaining points of disagreement involving Credit.

Paul:

I will have Mathew Carnwath contact you early next week. Mathew is the 
controller at Caruastar's large Rittman Ohio mill and has been directed by 
the CFO (Lee Thrash) to work out these details. Mathew is only the messenger, 
but is in contact with the Caruastar attorney's on these issues.(FYI, he can 


Thanks for the help

John:  Please have Caraustar call Paul Radous about the cross default issue.  
Legal will wait to hear back from Paul after his discussion with your 
counterparty.

We are ok with reciprocal website financials.  Please have the counterparty 
call me to discuss the cross default threshold.  We use a widely accepted 
standard in the industry, which is 2% of total debt, rounded.  In fact, by 
this standard, Enron has set it's own threshold too low.






Paul:

John Fortunato has advised me that CP has only three (3) issues with the 
draft which we delivered in November, 2000.  The credit issues are:

(1)  CP financials available online - we'll need their website address

(2)  CP Threshold for cross default is too low and wish a "higher number" but 
have not given John any indication of what they want

Please let John and Stephanie know the outcome so that we can prepare 
executable docs.  Thanks.

P.S.  The legal issue was governing law, Texas or NY.  CP doesn't care but 
needs confirmation and possibly explanation.
