Sara,

Per Brant's request, please advise if it is more appropriate to have the 
requested master for Northern Border Partners, L.P. with RMT or ENA. 
According to the corporate database, two (2) of the three general partners 
(being Northern Plains Natural Gas Company and Pan Border Gas Company), are 
directly or indirectly owned by Enron Corp.

Let me know your thoughts.  

Cordially,
Susan S. Bailey

Fred has asked that we prepare an ISDA between ENA and Northern Border 
Partners, L.P., which is also a wholly owned Enron subsidiary.  Should we 
prepare an RMA or regular ISDA?  I have provided a worksheet that contains 
Enron's ownership structure and little else.  Let me know if I should provide 
another worksheet with more detail.

thanks
brant
