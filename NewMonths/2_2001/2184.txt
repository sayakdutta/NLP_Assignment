Hey Dena,  

Thanks for accompanying me to lunch today.  I really enjoyed our 
conversation.  You are very charming.  The rest of this week is pretty crazy 
and I am going to Austin for my friends wedding this weekend, but would you 
be interested in getting some dinner sometime next week?  Maybe Wed. or 
Thursday evening?   

Gerald
