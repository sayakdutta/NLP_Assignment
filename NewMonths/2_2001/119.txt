Hey,

Everyone's asked me how the happy hour was last night.  What a joke.  
Apparently everyone left about 9:00.  And here's the best part...Brad (new 
guy) was walking up as everyone was leaving.  Wasn't it nice of him to call 
and tell us that everyone was gone?  Or at least telling the bozos leaving 
that I was planning on coming so that someone would have called?  I told Jeff 
he owes me a Happy Hour b/c that definitely didn't count.  He said we'd have 
to do a Happy Hour that was for Susan and me.  I told him I wanted my Happy 
hour on the beach in Cancun.  I searched the internet for flights and sent 
him an email with the flight information.  

Talk to ya later,
Robin

PS  Have you decided where we're going for lunch?
