All, 

Carol asked that I provide you all with a "redlined" and "clean" version of 
the: (a)  updated Enron Corp. Guaranty form,  and  (b) updated Counterparty 
Guaranty form.

The attached updated form of Guaranty will be used by Enron Corp. and a 
Counterparty in connection with financial trading arrangements.
