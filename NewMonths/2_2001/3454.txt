Yes, I would like to attend if that would be possible.  Thanks very much for 
the info.  I assume that the folks on the committe are the energy managers of 
the companies (like K.C. Mares, who I met when I met with Justin a few weeks 
ago)?

Jeff - this is the Energy Committee Meeting.  I have invited well over 100
people, all who are on the Committee...not everyone is able to attend
however.  I am working on the agenda and expect to get that out to everyone
tomorrow.  Unfortunately, I have to get an estimated count to Cisco, who is
hosting the meeting, so that they can prepare for Monday.  We will be
discussing legislation that is of interest to us and our member company's
and we will be attempting to assemble a coalition of companies and
organizations to stand with us in regards to the legislation being
considered.  A lot of info will be passed around.  Do you think you may
attend?  Laura





Laura:
Thanks so much for including me on the list.  Quick question:  Which
committe is this and who's on the committe?  Is there an agenda for the
meeting on the 5th?  Thanks again.
Best,
Jeff
