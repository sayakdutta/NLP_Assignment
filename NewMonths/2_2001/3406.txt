FYI.  Not sure 1) who the right person is to forward this along to, or 2) if 
it's something that folks want to follow up on.  Anyway, here's the 
dope---Scott is an Enron outside lobbyist located in Sacramento.

Best,
Jeff

Jeff,

In light of our conversation about ongoing DA sales, the Theater Owners
Association of California would like to talk to someone at Enron about
DA contracts.  The contact is Milton Moritz (President) at (310)
657-7724 or (310) 652-1093, and his conversation with me should be
referenced as I know him personally.

Speak to you soon.

Scott
