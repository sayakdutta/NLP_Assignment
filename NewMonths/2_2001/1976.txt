Claire,

In response to my phone message of  1 February, 2001,  attached are two 
agreements for your review.  First is a GISB revised in acceptable form to 
ENA.  I have incorporated UGI's Special Revisions into ENA's save number 
(3).  Also, with regards to number (2),   "three business days" has been 
changed to "five" and revisions to  the last two sentences.

Finally, also attached is a draft of ENA's Master Firm Purchase/Sale 
Agreement.

Upon your review, please give me a call to discuss the attached.
