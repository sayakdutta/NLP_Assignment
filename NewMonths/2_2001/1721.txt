Do you mean LITERALLY across the street?  Yikes.  That's making it tough to 
ignore.

Steak doesn't really appeal to me.  Maybe a Ciro's salad?

Hi sweetie,
This is located across the street from my office in St Philips Luthern
Church. I didn't go in...
I moved the money to savings and got a crisp c note for Paige.
Any thoughts on dinner? We have a nice steak already cooked!
