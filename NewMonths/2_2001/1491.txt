Lynn Dekrey is the guy Mitch negotiated the deal with.  Lynn left me a 
message on Monday and said he didn't see a problem, but he didn't give me a 
day we could expect the letter.  I would expect it this week.

Who is Lynn and when can we expect the follow up letter (i.e. the one that 
expressly permits an increase in output at the Wheatland Plant)?
