It is a CompareRite document.  If you "view" it in email, then you can save 
it as a Word document.  If this doesn't work, let me know and I'll create a 
Word doc.

Kay thanks for sending this to me.  Unfortunately I am having difficulty 
opening the document.  Was it written in something besides Word?.  Randy
