Yes - it's a Puget deal. I'm trying to contact Sean right now to see if he 
and Diana overlapped on these deals. I only see them written once in his 
trade log, but I'm auditing the second two to find out who entered them.

534497 is a pudget deal?








Verified with Diana and Sean - these should be APB.

and the Williams deal should be resolved - deal # is 534497

i have 2 more things besides the williams deal.  apb is trying to leave thats 
why i was trying to get these deals resolved.

534496
534497

apb does not recognize, these may be duplicated deals that are already in the 
system.

thanks
