My dad has the same thing as Sheila's mom (athlersclerosis).  He gets tired 
easily, and doesn't walk very well.  But at least he can still walk!  He's 
only 70, but this stuff is progressive.  A long future is unlikely.

Michael adores his PopPop, and March is a nice time of year on the cost.  If 
I'm there I can do a lot of the hard stuff for my dad, which helps.

What kind of vehicle to you have?  I've decided that I need an SUV.






Yes, her appointment to be spayed is now March 15th.  I hope she finishes up 
this week because she's going to the pet hotel on Saturday.  If she's not 
finished, I'm going to get the doctor to look at her.  Poor thing is just 
running out of energy so fast, but then so would I if I had been going that 
long.  I had to go buy her another box of maxi pads!  It's like having a 
daughter!

Oh, I agree, you should let him spend time with your dad.  You never want to 
have any regrets.  What's wrong with your dad.  Is it his heart?  I remember 
him not being well a while back, but I can't remember what is was 
(senility).  I know Emma really misses my mother.

Poor baby!  At least it is only twice a year, or in her case, this one last 
time.

I think I may take him fishing with my dad and mom in Palacios.  He really 
loves it, and my dad is in declining  health, but can still get around.  I 
hate to waste the opportunitty to let them spend time together.

That's what I was thinking too!  Let me check calendars and send out an email 
regarding same.

Did you find something for you and Michael to do on spring break?  Ruthie is 
STILL in heat!  Bless her heart, she's been bleeding 13 days!

Maybe we should have the GE call on Thursday, or maybe Friday am.
