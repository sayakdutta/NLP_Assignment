Attached you can find a load factor analysis for Stagecoach.  This analysis 
shows MMBtus and KWhrs based on different loads for both the summer (June, 
July, and August)  and the winter months (September, October, November, 
december, January, February, March, April & May).  

Please notice that the heat rate equals 7,500 Btu/HPhr and the billing demand 
equals 10,980KW.

PLease don't hesitate to call me at 5-3269 if you have any questions.
