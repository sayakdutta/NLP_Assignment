Carol:
Steve should double check.  As I understand it, they did vote out the 
decision implementing AB1X, however, the decision removed the language 
prohibiting direct access and made DWR, not the utility, "responsible" for 
any shortfalls caused by the difference between the price cap and DWR's cost 
of buying power.

Best,
Jeff

Steven just called in from the Capitol with the following information:

   Today, Thursday, Feb. 22, the CPUC did not vote out the draft decision
implementing AB1X.   Also, the CPUC held the Wood decision.
