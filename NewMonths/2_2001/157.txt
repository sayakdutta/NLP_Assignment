I think it is sad that he died but I 'm certainly fine.  He was pretty old 
and I really was not really close to him though, but he was a very nice and 
intelligent man.  About 8 years ago, I went to Utah on business with Dupont 
and I stayed over the weekend with him.  He took me all around Salt Lake City 
and showed me a bunch of neat stuff.  That's what I will remember about him 
most.








Charlie,  I just heard from dad on Tuesday that Nate had died on
Sunday.  He said he and Stacey were going to the funeral.  I emailed
Stacey and told her I hoped she was ok.  Anyway, I don't know how you
feel but if you are sad I hope you are ok also.  I didn't know him - I
had only met him once or twice and that was many, many years ago.  Love,
Margaret
