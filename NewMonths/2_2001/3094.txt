Mike, Jeanne:
Have you heard anything about any relief on penalties that the PUC might have 
recently granted interruptible customers?  (Recall that Loretta has refused 
to allow folks on interruptible to get off those contracts.)  Could you let 
me know as soon as you find something out?  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff

Can we get some information on this as soon as possible.  We are getting 
calls from customers, etc., and we need the information in order to make the 
necessary decisions on billing.  Please include Diann Huddleson on any 
responses.  Thanks.

Nancy, do you know anything about  a Order from CA Governor on I6 rate 
relief?  If the customers are being granted some relief, I need to know so we 
can exempt these charges from the bills.

Thanks.

Diann, per Tom's request I have copied the SR  in an e-mail to you.  Let me 
know if you need additional information.

  SR Customer (Tim Ball) received  January invoice for delivered service 
11/20 -12/20 2000 with interruptible penalty charges. He wants know should he 
pay the full amount or deduct the penalty and pay for the delivered 
services?  This is according to his interpretation of the California 
governor's order on I6 rate relief
