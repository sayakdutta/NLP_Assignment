Hey Dad -
Thanks for your update on the status of the sailing club's opening day. For 
my purposes, April 22 works better simply because I probably won't be coming 
anyway..... Just joking. Looks like I mistakenly made it onto your sailing 
club e-mail list. Unless I'm really invited to opening day?

After some discussion about WSC Opening Day date,  Marilyn and I would like 
to propose moving it from Apr. 1 to Apr. 22. Our  reasoning is as follows:
?
1. Apr. 1 is last day of spring break which will be  a conflict for many WSC 
families. It's also just a week after the board chili  feed on Mar. 25.
?
2. Apr. 22 is the last Sunday of series sailing  before we go to evenings. 
It's the week after Easter, chances for good weather  are marginally better, 
and there are no conflicts that we are aware  of.
?
If you have any suggestions pro or con, please let  me know by Wednesday (we 
need to publish date in Mar. Telltales). If not, we'll  go with Apr. 22. 
Thanks,
?
Bill
