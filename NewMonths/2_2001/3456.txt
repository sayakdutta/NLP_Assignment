Here is the final version.  I'll bring copies with me tomorrow to Sacramento 
and can drop them off at Hedy's office.  I meet with Kari Dohn at 10 AM and 
will be attending the AB 1890 Implementation Group meeting at 1:30.  I can 
drop off copies before I head out for the Dohn meeting.  If there's anything 
else, just let me know.  Thanks.

Best,
Jeff
