hey thanks.  lsu has a lot to look fwd to next season with the studs you 
recruited.  what did you think of mack?

on a good recruiting class this year.  I met Mack Brown at a dinner honoring 
Rick Perry last week.  Did you get the check I sent you???  If so, did you 
deposit it???  Just trying to get my finances in order.
