Anna:

I just received your voice mail.  The package (including the Enron Corp. 
guaranty) has already gone out via Federal Express to your attention.  You 
should receive it tomorrow.

Also, Enron North America Corp. would like to assign the agreement to Enron 
Credit Inc. (a Delaware corporation).   Would you like for me to prepare the 
assignment or shall I?  Please advise.  Thanks.
