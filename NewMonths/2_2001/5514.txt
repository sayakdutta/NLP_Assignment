Mary:  I received a link several years ago to a European database.  I don't 
know how to send it to you.  It contains opinions, etc.  Either Justin 
doesn't know if its existence or London never uses it!

We are going to develop an index of what we have and enventually look to 
including it in our financial database.  Do you have an index developed yet?  
If so, could we get a copy?  I will keep you posted and provide ours to you 
as we move forward.  Thanks.  Mary

hello mary

thanks for for your note.

we don't currently have a central legal database of opinions from various 
legal jurisdictions, although it is envisaged that in due course we will pull 
these together onto a central database.  i would certainly welcome any 
thoughts/ideas you may have in this respect

regards

justin

Hi Justin.  It has been quite some time.  I hope all is well with you.  I am 
back after teaching for a year--it was fun and I received my certification 
(hopefully for later use.)

Sara Shackleton mentioned that at one time your office created (and perhaps 
still updates and utilizes) a legal opinion database with respect to physical 
and financial trading matters in various jurisdictions.  Could you advise if 
this is the case?  If so, I would like to visit with you about it.  If this 
is not within your purview, could you forward this to the correct person and 
advise me of whom that would be.  We are working to organize our opinions and 
thought it would be helpful to know what the London office has.

Thanks much.
