here's the redline.

I gave my hard-copy of the Act itself (in the version we agreed upon) to 
Kaye, along w/ copies of three or four law firm memos on the CFMA, in case 
you think any or all of those should be included in the binder.  I told Kaye 
she would hear from you later on the binder -- Bob
