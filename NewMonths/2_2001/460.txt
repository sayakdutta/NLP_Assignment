i would be comfortable around stacey.  she is cool.  i took my girlfriend out 
to dinner and all i got her was a card.  we had a good time until i ruined it 
at the end of the night and now she is pissed at me.  i didn't stay over last 
night so she was pissed.  i understand though.  i don't think i can make it 
to miami.  i want to go but i have to attend a wedding of a friend from 
college.  actually, i am going to caymen the last weekend in march with my 
group from work so if you want me to check anything out let me know.  i will 
scout the island for you and max.  i will give you guys a call this weekend.  
take care.
