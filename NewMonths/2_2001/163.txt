Just fill out form and send $2000 in.  Contribution is for year 2001.  I've 
been real busy.







Charlie,  I received my check from Bidwell for $2,023. and some change.
I have an IRA form for my 2001 contribution from Fidelity.  Is there
anything I need to do besides fill out the form and mail a check?

I talked to Mama yesterday - she said your house was looking good.  I
signed Travis up for the Pony League baseball - it will be a lot
different from Little League and I think he is a little nervous but so
is everyone else that is moving up.  Elizabeth is doing the reading for
mass at school on Thursday - it is the first grade class turn again and
she did the responsorial psalm last time.  Her two main teachers told
the religion teacher that Elizabeth would have to read again because the
reading was long and complicated and Elizabeth was the only one that
would be capable of doing it.  I was really proud - not bad for a
daughter that was supposed to be retarded- I always feel like telling
the doctor's that they don't know everything.  Anyway, I hope you'll are
doing great and let me know about my contribution.  Love, Margaret
