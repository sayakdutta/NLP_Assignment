We'd like to create a daily and monthly trade volume report, similar to the 
EOL Report we currently use to track both online and brokered trades done in 
the Portland office each day. The EOL JF tab seems to track the same data we 
need for a daily volume report; however, it does not display the data in the 
form we need. 

Under the "Sort By" heading at the bottom of the report, there are two 
choices - "Deal #" and "Desk." As I run it now, the report displays megawatt 
volumes and total deals according to desk. We now need to display the data 
according to delivery point. 

Please call Cara Semperger or myself when you get a moment, and we can fill 
you in on all the parameters she's looking for in this report. From there I 
think it should be a pretty simple modification of the query.

Thanks in advance for your help on this.
