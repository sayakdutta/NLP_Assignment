My opinion is that there is that the letter agreement is not ready to be sent 
out, and won't be for a day or two.  It can't be sent out until the CA is 
returned to you signed.




   
	
	
		


Draft CA for Northwestern Corp.

Kay,

Chris Booth has been contacted by Northwestern Corp. regarding the purchase 
of our 7EA's.  Chris believes this is a very positive potential sale and 
there is no broker involved.  Attached is the CA for your review.  I used our 
form from your "Confidentiality Agreements" folder  (Chris would like to send 
the draft to Northwestern via e-mail this evening if possible).

Also attached is a copy of the Letter Agreement for the Purchase of 
Membership Interests that was prepared by Carolyn Campbell (per Chris Booth). 
Since the Northwestern Corp. transaction will be a turbo park deal (and you 
are the Queen of Turbo Park), Chris asked for your review and approval or 
comments.

Thanks
