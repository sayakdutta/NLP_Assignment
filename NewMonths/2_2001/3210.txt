Francisco - Here is an ISDA that Peggy needs in connection with a project she 
is working on in Mexico.  Can you take care of this one?  It looks like it is 
a deal-specific agreement for an interest rate swap or swaps.  Sara can 
probably fill you in on the kinds of changes from our standard form that 
would be ok.

Attached are some comments from Enron's outside counel on the draft ISDA 
Master Agreement which I forwarded to you earlier this week.

Could you please advise who is reviewing this document and when their review 
might be completed.

Thank you for your assistance.

Attached is the email forwarding the draft swap agt with SG.

Rogelio--please take a look at the docs required in Part 3-- some changes 
will need to be made I am sure to reflect that EEIM is a Mexican 
company--please fax me a markup with your suggested changes.  It looks like 
we are going to need Mexican Power of Attorney for CT Corp. for this 
agreement also.

Carlyn--please look at the CT Corp. appointment letter and let me know if any 
hedging agt is contemplated to be included.  We may need a separate 
appointment letter for this document (see Part 5, clause (vi)) -- note also 
that the jurisdictional consent language is different than in the Loan Agt 
and most of the other IDB docs--I don't think we care but I will point it out 
to SG--they may want to conform the language to have the same court 
jurisdiction.

Mike--on substantive issues, please call me when you get back into town and 
have a moment to talk.  I spoke with one of my partners in Houston who is 
much more familiar with swaps and he thinks it looks ok for the most part--I 
have only a few questions/comments for you.

Thanks all!
