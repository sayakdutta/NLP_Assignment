We have arranged for representatives from tax, accounting, commercial, and 
legal to make presentations relating to the purpose, structure, mechanics, 
etc. associated with the Whitewing/Condor deconsolidated affiliate.  I think 
that the more all of us are "conversant" with that structure, it should 
simplify the legal efforts in closing deals---especially in Q4.  To that end, 
please invite those colleagues of yours that could benefit from this 
presentation and please let my assistant, Darlene Forsyth at x37254 , know 
who will be attending so we can reserve the right size conference room and 
order lunch.

Thanks.
Jordan
