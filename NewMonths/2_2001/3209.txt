Looks like I will NOT be able to have my cell phone on during our meetings - 
but here is the number if you need to get a message to me.

I have included information in the attached document on our dinner plans for 
Monday night.  All transportation information is also enclosed.




Remember, we ask that you turn off all pagers and phones for the ASE.  The 
contact number there is  214-303-7700 or fax is 214-303-7643.
ASE personnel will take a message and pass along to you as needed.

See you Monday morning!
