I would like to request information and application materials for your 
advanced studies program in Bologna, Italy, as well as for Master's Degree 
study in international relations at Johns Hopkins University. I am interested 
in applying for the academic year of 2002-2003, but I'd like to gather all 
the necessary information as soon as possible.

Thank you,
