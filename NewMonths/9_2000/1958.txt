Welcome back!  Please follow up with Florida P&L and DLJIC.
Please send the marked Guaranty to Harvard.  I do not need to see Clem's 
comments.
Let's schedule a call about BuySideDirect.
Thanks.  Sara

Arizona Public Service:  They have agreed to all of our changes.  I'm going 
to send a blackline out today and I will get with Samantha for execution 
copies.

Florida P&L - No response yet.

DLJIC - No response yet.

Harvard - C. Abrams made comments to the Guaranty.  Before I send them out I 
will wait to hear from you.

I see that Buy Side Direct came back with comments.   I will wait to hear 
from you to see where we are.

Thanks,

Jason
