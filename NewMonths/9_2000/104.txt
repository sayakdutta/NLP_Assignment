Kristin, I have it on the calendar for Friday, October 13.  I also left 
Friday, November 10 on the calendar, too.  I'll check with him about meeting 
you vs. picking you up and let you know what he says.  Hope your having a 
good day - see you Saturday night.  SRS








i tihnk that fridays would be the best. So that friday the 13th would work.
I get out of class at 11:55 so if he wants to pick me up or i will meet hi
somewhere...it doesn't really matter to me. Just email me back and let me
know what he wants to do

Hi, Kristin.  Your Dad asked me to get in touch with you to see about
setting up some lunches for the two of you.  He's traveling quite a bit
again in October, but I'll give you the dates he's available and you tell
me which of those days you can do it:

Friday, October 13
Monday, October 16
Thursday, October 19
Thursday, October 26
Wednesday, November 1
Monday, November 6
Friday, November 10
Monday, November 13
Tuesday, November 14.

I'll hold all of these dates for you until I hear back from you.  Would you
be able to go at 12:00 noon?  SRS
