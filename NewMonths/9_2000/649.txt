Thanks again for thinking of me.  Lunch next week sounds good.  Any day of 
the week is fine with me as long as we get started around 11:30.  Just let me 
know what day is best for you.

I will let you know when I have extra tickets.  Right now it looks like I 
have some tickets for all games except atm.

How about lunch next week?  Let me know.
