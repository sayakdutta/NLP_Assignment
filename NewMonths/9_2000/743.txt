Can you tell if the documents have been filed in the state of incorporation?

Could you send me an email with a description of what you learned about how 
this done?  I know the procedures weren't followed.

Thanks,

Kay

Deb,

Could you please check with the state of incorporation (I believe Delaware) 
and the Corp Secretary's office to see if the papers have been processed in 
both places?

Thanks,

Kay

I received the name change document and it has been executed on behalf of 
Peoples and Enron.  I have also received and returned some state (IL) 
registration documents from you and Lillian Bailey.  

My understanding is that we have done everything we need to do to effect the 
entity name change to enovate, L.L.C.  Kay Mann is trying to follow up and 
confirm that all of the proper paperwork is in place.

Please let me know if there is anything further I can do to facilitate the 
process.

thanks,
Russell
