Yes, I'll be in Death Valley hoping that the weather is as gorgeous as it is 
today.  Dinner sounds great but I can't get together until after my 
VACATION.  So let's shoot for after October 15.  By the way, I heard that Joe 
Manascalco died.  Also, are you still interested in the LSU mineral law 
institutes?  Have fun in N.O.  Sara

Sara:

 I found a nice restaurant in the Village that I would like to go to
with you and Donna one evening next week if you guys are up for it. I am
heading to New Orleans this weekend for some nice food and to see some
old friends. Are you going to the Tigers vs. Tennessee game Saturday
night?
