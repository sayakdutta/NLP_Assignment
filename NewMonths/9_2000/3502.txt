FYI, Reagan is a man, a developer in Ben Jacoby's group.

I checked the paper for an obit about Don.  Was there one?  How was his 
mother?

Are you going to Jillian's on Thursday?

Can't wait to see pics.  I'll be by soon.

20 was all I could find.  I saw where Reagan could get it on 29.  I'll call 
her and get a room number and let catering know.  These rooms fill up so 
fast!!!!!!

We had to go to Don's "event" yesterday, so that was rather difficult on 
Ric.  He's doing pretty good, trying to take it a day at a time.  I worked on 
notecards all weekend.  I have your blow up and also need to know if you want 
your cards in matte or glossy (I have samples).  The glossy ones are $3 
each.  That paper is so expensive that I had to go up on the price.  The blow 
up looks great and it's $10.00.

Please see if there is any way we can have it in the same elevator bank.  I 
will ask to have it on 29, so you won't need to check there.

Hope you've had a great weekend.  The weather was PERFECT!!!!

Kay




The meeting will be held at 9am in EB20C2.

Please see if you can get a conference room, allowing 2 hours for the meeting.

Thanks,

Kay

How does everybody look for a discussion concerning the VEPCO interconnection 
agreement on Tuesday, Sept 19?

I've checked with Christi, Mitch and Reagan, so they don't need to confirm.

Details to follow...

Thanks,

Kay
