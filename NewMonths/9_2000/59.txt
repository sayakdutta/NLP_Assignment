Don,

Greg would love to see you.  What about lunch on the 13th?  (He's in PRC all 
day on the 12th)  Lets say 11:30a.m.   We're located at EB2801.

Take Care,

Liz

Greg,

I will be in Houston for a few days the week of the 11th of September.  I 
would appreciate your help as a career guidance counselor.  I would like 
-+30mins of your time on the afternoon of the 12th or the morning of the 13th 
of Sept.  If this works for you, have Liz contact me to set something up.  
Thanks, Don
