(1)  Will the ISDA be negotiated prior to execution of your trade?
(2)  Are the trade terms correct?  You did not send me a deal ticket.  Who is 
the trader?  Who will be responsible for payments under the swap (i.e., will 
it be you)?
(3)  What happened to comments on the Schedule?
(4)  Who is reviewing the Schedule from a credit perspective?

Could you please refax my comments to your Schedule?  I have misplaced my 
version.  Thanks.  Sara
