Paul,

I shall be in London in the beginning of October.
I shall notify you about the timing of my trip later this week.

Vince









I understand this has been cancelled - no problem - life is kind of hectic 
here
anyway!!  Why don't we try to rearrange next time you're over?

Kind regards

Paul Day

in London on Monday morning (September 18) and  leave on
Thursday in the evening.

Please, let me know what would be convenient time
to meet. You can send me an E-mail message and my secretary
will contact to confirm the date and place of the meeting.
My assistant's name is Shirley Crenshaw and her phone

I look forward to meeting you, Tom and Julian.
