Attached is my suggested language.  The confirms already provide for Market 
Quotation and Second Method; the Optional Early Termination provision should 
be the only exception for using the Calculation Agent for termination 
purposes.  Of course, the Calculation Agent will determine AECO prices for 
payment purposes, but that is not related to termination.
