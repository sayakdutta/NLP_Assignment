Per my conversations with Mark Taylor, we should continue to put any weather 
trades done online under any relevant master agreement with the 
counterparty.  Further, there is no prohibition against doing a trade online 
with a counterparty when we do not have a master in place.  Any non-master 
trades would go under the respective GTC.  It appears to be only a 
coincidence that we are trading online only with counterparties we have 
masters in place with.
