Sounds tempting, but I'm otherwise committed.  DF









Hey -

I just found out there's a live web cam right down the block from the
library, focused on a Snoopy statue.

If I go stand there at 1:30 central
 will you  take a look?


I'll send the address - I checked it out. It works.

Should we try it?
