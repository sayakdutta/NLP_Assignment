Allyson,

Here's a suggestion on the language to address the issue of termination "for 
any reason".

On page 3, line 18, insert after "limits", deleting the remainder of the 
sentence:

Applicant's requirement to notify the Commission to instances where the 
Agreement is terminated as a result of Applicant's default. 

Thanks,

Kay
