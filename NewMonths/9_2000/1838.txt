I just wanted to let you know I haven't forgotten you.  My usual source for 
getting the ETA's is out, and I'm trying to track down someone else who can 
send them to me...

My buddy Edmund is out of the office for a while.  Can you tell me who else I 
can contact to get a copy of EnronOnline's ETA for Mexico and Japan?
