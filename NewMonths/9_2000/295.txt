I received a telephone call from Schultes' attorney requesting that we make 
Barth, McConville, and the two analysts who went to Thailand available for 
depositions. Schultes' atty's names are Bill Redmond 440-893-0338 and Joel 
Levin 216-928-0600. They have a discovery deadline in Oct. I tried to talk 
them out of it but they insisted. I instead suggested a telephone interview 
with limited depositions to follow. Please call me Tues about this.
