As a follow-up to my earlier e-mail regarding Steve Brownell's experience
regarding municipalization strategies as a way to facilitate Enron's efforts
to be the energy manager for communities, I have attached a proposal
pursuant to which you can potentially use tax-exempt financing to
restructure power contracts.  Let me know if you or anyone else over there
are interested in talking about this further.  I think it's an interesting
idea.
