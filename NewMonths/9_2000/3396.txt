Pretty small stuff from a dollar standpoint.  Perhaps the sky is not falling.

This seems too small to bother with. What do you think?

Ben,

Per our conversation, attached is the requested Punchlist.  The original, 
estimated value to correct all the discrepancies was approximately $250,000.  
After our discussions with SSEP on September 19, 2000, staffing levels and an 
increased productivity correcting the discrepancies took place.  Currently, 
we estimate that SSEP has about $35,000 left to correct and we expect them to 
finish by September 30, 2000.  Please note that the aforementioned 
description does not include the discrepancy we discovered concerning 
Enclosure Area Classification relating to gas migration.  We estimate that it 
will cost approximately $2,000 per unit ($48,000) to correct.  Our 
engineering is looking at this now and we plan to have an answer on this next 
week.

If there is any further assistance we can provide, please contact me at 
713-646-8258.
