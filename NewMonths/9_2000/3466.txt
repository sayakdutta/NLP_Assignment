One more thing.  Did someone send you copies of equipment contracts?  Those 
have confidentiality provisions which need to be considered.  Therefore, 
please advise what you received from Enron in that regard.

I was under the impression that most of what we were submitting we were 
submitting as confidential information, specifically including the responses 
to the Public Staff's data requests.  I don't recall the specifics at this 
point.

Thanks again,

Kay







The Application itself is public.  The testimony is public.  Without going
back through the material we have supplied (which I would be happy to do, if
you like), the primary material that was confidential was the cost data and
supporting work papers.  Also, the engineering plan we filed recently in
response to a data request was confidential.

Let me know if you would like me to walk back through it more specifically.




Hi Allyson,

Someone was asking which of the information we have filed is public
information.  Is the petition itself public?  What else would be public?

I know this is a variation to the "what is confidential" question. Once
again, your assistance is appreciated.

Kay
