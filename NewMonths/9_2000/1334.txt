Mark: Attached is the legal opinion from outside counsel. Sorry, I guess I 
sent it to the wrong e-mail address.

Team:

Attached is the last version of the memorandum from Pinheiro Neto addressing 
the questionnaire prepared by Mark Taylor. I suggest that we all take a look 
at it and identify questions and areas that we would like PN to expand or 
further explain. We could then schedule a conference call to share our 
thoughts and define next steps. I will be out of the office Monday through 
Wednesday next week. Thursday and Friday are holidays in Brazil. Please let 
me know how your schedule looks like from the 26th on so we can schedule 
something. Thanks.
