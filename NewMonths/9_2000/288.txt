I spoke w/ Steve Hamilton (Pres/CEO) about co-signing the letter and although 
he agrees with the content, etc... he's a bit reluctant.  His concern is that 
if JB somehow pulls together the money to take us out, he will be 
ostracized.  What are your thoughts?  Is it still ok for me to send it as a 
member of and on behalf of the BOD?
