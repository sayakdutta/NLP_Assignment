Gerald,

I contacted Sandra Grimes and John Lopez, Manager of Logistics, of Oasis Pipe 
Line Company and informed them that the contracts should remain with Enron 
North America Corp.  

However, they have asked for an agreement or letter to disregard the 
assignment and assumption agreement effective September 1, 2000.  They would 
like to have this agreement or letter ASAP. 

I will fax it to:  Atten:  Sandra Grimes
        Fax:  (713)  758-9835

I can forward the original to Oasis Pipe Line Company on Tuesday, 9/5/2000.  


Let me know when the agreement or letter is ready and I will route it for 
signatures, accordingly.  If it cannot be ready today, I will contact Sandra 
Grimes and John Lopez and inform them that it will be ready on Tuesday, 
9/5/2000.

The Oasis Pipeline Contracts are still being routed for signature.  However, 
I received this e-mail from Stacey Neuweiler to continue business as ENA not 
HPLC.

Thank You.

Per Tom Martin's request, please continue business as ENA, not HPLC for 
September 1,2000.  Until we know the future of Houston Pipeline, we will 
continue transacting as ENA.  Thank you very much for all of your help with 
this.
