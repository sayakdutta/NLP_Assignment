Heather,

Just go to your DASH form file and pull out language from another deal just 
like this one.  That's how we handle things on the 38th floor.

Dan and Kay,

I've added a sentence about the $2mm penalty payment.  Not sure how to 
address the regulatory reopener risk.

Any suggestions?

Heather
