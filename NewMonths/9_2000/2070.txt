Bill:  We are proposing the following compromise language to the bank 
regarding "Transfer": 

Party A may transfer its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in 
whole but not in part, to any Affiliate that is a resident for income tax 
purposes of the United States or Canada.......

We typically don't resrict the jurisdiction of our Affiliates.

Is this O.K. with you?
