I'm trying to avoid a two elevator ride, if possible.  God forbid I should 
take the stairs!  I'll let you know what he comes up with, if anything.

I've already got a conference room and requested breakfast on 20.  Let me 
know if she gets a room so I can change the catering order and call Rudy and 
tell him we don't need his room.

Hi Reagan,

Is a conference room available on 29?  We are having a hard time finding a 
meeting place.

Thanks,

Kay

That will work fine for me.



I should mention 900am as the time!

How does everybody look for a discussion concerning the VEPCO
interconnection agreement on Tuesday, Sept 19?

I've checked with Christi, Mitch and Reagan, so they don't need to confirm.

Details to follow...

Thanks,

Kay
