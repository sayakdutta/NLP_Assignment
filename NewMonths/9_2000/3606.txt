Thanks.  And thanks for the drink.






Everyone else is available.  I just talked to Sheila and she said to invite 
Barto (which I just left him a vm).  She said the meeting could proceed and 
Dieball could be filled in.  I'll let you know what I hear from Barto.

Is he availabe tomorrow?

Once you get a picture of availability (maybe you have it all ready), ask 
Sheila what she wants to do. She may want to re-schedule for tomorrow morning.

Scott Dieball isn't available today.  Is he key, or should we try for 
tomorrow?  I didn't know how urgent the meeting was.
