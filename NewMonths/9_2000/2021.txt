Sara,
Hope all is well by you.
Attached is a marked and clean draft of the confirmation for the Swap
Transaction, revised to reflect our discussion on your comments. I note that
the confirmation retains the Change in Law provision (with marked changes)
for this Transaction. We agree to discuss further the Change in Law
provision in respect of future Transactions. Please call/email me with any
comments.
Regards
