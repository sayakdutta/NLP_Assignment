Jim, deal 226121 is our long term CNG pool sale to EES - the volume is around 
1,000/day each month.

Deal 348393 is our wonderful sale to you behind EOG for July and August.

Whats up?


   
	
	
		


Chris,

 I have two deals ( #348393 and #226121) that I show were sold to EES that 
EES is not recognizing - they do not have on their books.  Can you either 
send me some support for these deals or get in touch with Jim Barker (with 
EES) and have him enter these pieces on his side?  Let me know if you need 
any other information.  Thanks...
