Sam:  Until Gary's group receives access to this part of our Lotus Notes 
database, we will have to rely on my "in the pipeline" list.  The following 
agreements from that list need to be added to Lotus Notes:

(1)  BuySideDirect

(2)  Ing Barings

(3)  Thomas Weisel Partners

(4)  Market Axess

(5)  LIMITrader Securities, Inc.

(6)  Trading Edge, Inc.

My list identifies the Enron companies.  Thanks.  Sara
