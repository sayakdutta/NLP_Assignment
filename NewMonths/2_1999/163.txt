Mark

I will be starting Monday 15th  March and finishing Friday 7th May. Very much 
looking forward to coming over.

See you then.

Robert



Robert:

I believe that Sylvia Sauseda usually handles these matters.  Please let us 
both know the date you will be arriving with as much notice as possible so 
that we can have things ready for you.  We're looking forward to seeing you!
