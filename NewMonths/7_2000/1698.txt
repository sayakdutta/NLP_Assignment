What's the best time to call you to discuss your memo?  Also, unless I hear 
from you otherwise, I will plan on conferencing you into our legal/credit 
meeting tomorrow at 2:00 pm.  I have your number as (281) 890-7122.

Sara:
Great news!  I will give her a call on Monday!  Hope all is going well.  
Again, I'm happy to participate in the legal/credit meeting on Tuesday by 
phone.  Alos, do we need to go through my memo?  Just call or e-mail me.
