I am comfortable w/ the changes. On question of whether we colluded W/  
Powerex, I would opt for simpler alternative and say we complied w/ all rules 
of the pool. Thanks.

copy of the Background note discussed earlier this week.  The revisions are 
based on comments  from Frontier Economics and GPC, and further reflection by 
Rob Hemstock and myself. I have also attached the  raw calculations from 
Frontier that underlie several of the revisions.  I have not  sent the 
revised document to outside counsel for review.
