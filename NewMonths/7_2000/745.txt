Okay, okay...The real Susan is back.  So, do you think I should sport the 
leopard pants to the party?

By the way, your personal taxi service is on call Sunday  so just let me know 
when you need to be picked up (you're flying out of intercontinental, right?).

Look at you trying to bring me out of my shell.  I don't know if I'm really 
ready though to meet so many new people.  Remember...I am a shy, retiring 
wall-flower.
