Ted, 

I tried to send this page a little while ago and I think it failed.  So, you 
may have to actually drop this address into the netscape location section to 
bring up the site.

Anyway, there seemed to be a pretty good selection on the web.  Still, I 
think the one on this page best captures the kind of image you're looking to 
project.

If you'd rather shop around try these (there are some outstanding designs)...
