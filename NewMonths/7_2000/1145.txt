The EnronOnline guy responsible for the video is trying to get the contractor 
we used to get these guys to stop using our name.  Louise may want us to 
contact them if he is not successful.

Unfortunately, they had nothing to do with EnronOnline.   It was a promo 
video we can't use.

They were a company that was subcontracted out to do a promotional video for 
EnronOnline.  The people we contracted with is the one Enron uses for all 
videos - I believe are suing Hydrogen as the video is unusable.

Kal and legal are chasing.

Hi all;

There is some coverage of Enron Online through a highlighted site of the day 
on Macromedia.  A company called Hydrogen Interactive is highlighted, and one 
of the highlighted claim to fames of Hydrogen is some work that they did for 
Enron Online.  This should increase Enron exposure in the techworld as this 
macromedia site is well followed.  Links below.
