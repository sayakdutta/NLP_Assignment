Dear Sara,

Just a quick note this month because I know a lot of you are on
vacation or traveling this time of year.  There have been a lot
of exciting things going on at Netstock, but to keep things short
I will only mention a few:

In response to your requests, we will be adding over 1,000 new
stocks and index funds to ShareBuilder during the next few weeks.
Soon you'll have over 3,000 securities to choose from to help
diversify your portfolio!  Some of the recently added ShareBuilder
stocks include Polo Ralph Lauren (RL), Reebok International (RBK),
Teradyne (TER), LookSmart (LOOK) and WatchGuard Technologies
(WGRD) to name a few.  To view the complete list go to
http://www.sharebuilder.com
and click on 'ShareBuilder Stock List'.

There is also another change that I=0F'd like to mention, that affects
some ShareBuilders.  Rather than send an email to you for every
dividend reinvestment, we will now automatically post your dividend
reinvestment information to your monthly statement.  You can also
find this information under the =0F`Account=0F' tab on
http://www.sharebuilder.com .

If you have any questions, I urge you to contact one of our customer


us directly at 1-888-NET-STOK between the hours of 6 AM and 6 PM
Pacific Time Monday through Friday.

Best regards,

Jeff Seely
President and CEO
