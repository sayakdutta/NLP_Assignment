I think I have everything except the termination agreement.  I'll check, and 
send you what I have.




Kay:  I have not received copies of any of the GE contracts.  Do you have 
them?  If so, could I please have a copy of whatever has been executed.

Thank you.

I haven't seen a signed copy of the termination agreement cross my desk.  I 
just want to make sure that the fully executed document has been processed.

Thanks,

Kay
