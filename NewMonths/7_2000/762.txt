Hey yourself, 

Actually, my day is going very well.  It just so happens that my trader is 
out of town all week so, except for a few stressful phone calls this morning 
to assess the market, the day has been relatively uneventful.  All I want to 
know is how do I get your hours (or should I say lack thereof).  Anyway, my 
roommate and I had already made plans for tonight, but a movie tomorrow night 
sounds good.  Just fill me in on the details.  

Susan

PS - I'll be purchasing my neon, leopard-print cowboy hat shortly.

Hey,

I hope your day is going well.  I will be in Colorado Wednesday through the 
weekend, so I want to see if you were free to see The Perfect Storm before I 
leave on my mini-vacation.  These 3 and 2 day weeks are really getting too 
much. Just let me know if your schedule is free for a 9:00 show either 
tonight or tomorrow and I'll talk to you later.

Ted
