Hi Juan,

Some strange things happened when I restarted my computer.  This little 
screen came up, saying "installation aborted".  I chose ok, which was my only 
option.  I'm obviously on it now, so we'll see how it goes.  

Thanks,

Kay

I am on my way up.  Please be sure that your data files are backed up.  You 
should be okay if you've been saving to your H: drive.

Hi Juan,

I'll be in a meeting from 2-3 today.  Does that work for re-imaging my 
machine?

By the way, how long does it take?  If it takes less than an hour, then you 
can have it anytime today.

Thanks,

Kay
