Shijie,

We would like you to meet tomorrow morning, starting at 9:00,  with a few 
members of the 
group. Around 11:15 we shall go to lunch (myself, Stinson Gibner and Zimin 
Lu).
At 1:00 we would like you to make a presentation to the Research Group on the 
topic
of your choice. After 2:30 we shall continue with individual meetings.

We shall give you an agenda with the names and times when you arrive.

You can come to the lobby of the Enron building (1400 Smith)
between 8:30 and 9:00 and call me (3-3848) or my assistant,
Shirley Crenshaw (3-5290), to be admitted to the building.
We are on the 19th floor.

Look forward to meeting you.

Vince Kaminski
