I just received this so I wanted to pass it along.  I'll work through the 
comments and get back to you with any questions.

Kay:  I just received your voice mail message.  I sent the attached memo to
my client yesterday.  Why don't you review it and then give me a call back
to discuss it.  I will be here all day today, but out tomorrow until late
afternoon.  Look forward to talking with you.
