I think it's a good idea since the provisional application is on file - 
Travis is the internal lawyer who has taken care of the patent application so 
he will have better ideas for where the words should be placed and 
appropriate look and feel (I would guess near the copyright notice and 
roughly equivalent size).

Mark,

We are thinking of adding a Patent Pending message to key EnronOnline pages 
(like the homepage). Can you offer comments/concerns/guidelines?
