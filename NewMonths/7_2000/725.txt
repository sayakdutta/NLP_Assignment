Jeannie,

Thanks for asking about my dad, he is doing very well after surgery which we 
believe was successful.

My kids loved it.  The really enjoyed learning about Dad's work and what I 
do.  I think that this is a very important event because we all spend so much 
time here at Enron.  I have two children Claire - 9  and Michael - 6. They 
both look forward to the event and talk about it for weeks prior to the 
actual day.  Actually my daughter talks about it all year long.  Also they 
really can identify with Enron and talk more about it because of events like 
these.

Mike

Mike -- I hope you don't mind this, but I remember seeing you and your 
children at Take Your Child to Work day. I'm writing up a small story for 
Enron Business, and I wonder if you have a comment to make on this day.

Did you and your children enjoy the day? What were their favorite activities?
With all the things you have on your plate, why did you take the time to 
bring them in and accompany them during the day?
What are your children's names and their ages?
Any general comment you wish to make.

If you have time for this, I'd love to see what you have to say.

I hope things are going well for your father.

Regards,
Jeannie
