what is going on in dallas?  is that where you are from?  i heard it is fun 
to go out up there.  i am staying in town this weekend b/c i have sailing 
lessons.  i am going to go out sat night if i don't get sea sick.  i got sea 
sick when i was on the cruise so i don' t think that i am going to be much of 
a sailor.  let me know if you guys have a happy hour.
