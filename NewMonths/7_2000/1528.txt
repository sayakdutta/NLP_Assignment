No divisions should be opened up without the legal name as part of the title 
of the account, or the confirms will not go out right.  You have two on the 
7/14/00 list, TXU Gas Distribution, a division of TXU Gas Company, and 
Western Area Power Administration-Upper Great plain, a division of the United 
States Department of Energy.  Can you please change the name on the 
accounts.  I thought we came to agreement that this is what we would do for 
divisions, and Legal would be contacted if they wouldn't add the legal name 
on to the account.   The people who approve Password Applications should be 
sorting this out.

Can you please let me know how these two get resolved.  Thanks.
