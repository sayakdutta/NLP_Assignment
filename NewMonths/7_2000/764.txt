Ted,

Getting back to work has been a bit of a challenge after a weekend of 
indulgence and excess.  It took everything I had to get in the car and start 
the drive back to Houston Tuesday night (especially since I stopped by my 
sister's and tooled around on Lake Austin in the boat for a while before 
heading out).  As for the birthday shot, you are quite welcome - it was the 
least I could do.  

After my expenditures over the holiday, I will definitely be in town this 
weekend.  So, dinner Saturday sounds good.  As it stands right now, I am 
having a very pleasant day and I hope you are as well.

Susan

Susan,

How is getting back to work after living the high life in Austin?  Thanks 
again for the birthday shot and I wanted to see if you were free this weekend 
for dinner - say Saturday night (being the well organized guy that I am - I 
lost your home number otherwise I would have called).  Hopefully, you are 
having a good day and I'll talk to you later.

Ted
