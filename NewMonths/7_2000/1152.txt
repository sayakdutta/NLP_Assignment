Attached is the story with my comments.

1.  I changed 'standard" to 'familiar' and deleted the reference to price 
discovery since these are elements of futures contracts, comparison to which 
we would like to avoid.  If the price reference is important, 'transparency' 
would work as a replacement for 'discovery.'

2.  The changes to the last paragraph are to avoid the suggestion that the PA 
and Reg. forms can be filled out online (they are available to be downloaded 
but must be signed and sent to us offline).
