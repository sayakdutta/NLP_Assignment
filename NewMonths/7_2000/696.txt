Tomorrow at noon sounds good.  I have primarily been working on Denver 
stuff.  Although a new project up in Denver.  One that I wish I hadn't gotten 
involved in.  

I also need to hit the gym.  Been thinking about taking Kick Boxing lessons.  
A good way to take out aggression.

Hi.  Recovery is taking longer than I thought.  I've read all my mail, and 
washed all my clothes but I still owe quite a few people phone calls (long 
distance friends who called while I was away).  I was able to get some stuff 
done at work on Sunday but probably need to come in again this weekend.  I 
just feel unmotivated -- so need to hit the gym next week and will probably 
feel a lot  better.  

Lunch tomorrow sounds good -- noon downstairs?  

Are you still working on Colorado stuff or is something else keeping you busy?

Have you worked your way back into the real world yet or are you still 
adjusting?  This week has been pretty busy already and it is only Tuesday.  
Want to try and hook up for lunch tomorrow?  Let me know how your schedule 
looks.
