Just a reminder that when original documents are received on this transaction 
(which should be soon given that they went out Monday night), an original 
incumbency certificate for Media General should be included.  This should be 
delivered to Mark Taylor for his records.  Mark agreed to waive the 
requirement that the certificate be delivered at closing with the 
understanding that it would come promptly thereafter.
