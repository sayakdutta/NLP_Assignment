Mark,

This request was previously made to Susan Flynn.  Confirm has had no response 
from Legal and is awaiting our word.

Since you are the most Veteran member of the team would you mind advising as 
to whether Souad's language is OK.

If I can be of further help, just let me know.

Thanks.

Susan,

Please advise on the below issue-  this trade is from June 14th, and I 
haven't heard anything back on it from your team.
Please let me know as soon as you can in order for me to send out the confirm.

Thanks,

Susan,

This deal with Anadarko is a little tricky.  It is a Gas Daily Call Option 
with a cap.  I have added the cap language in the cash settlement paragraph.  
Joe is ok with the change, but wanted to get your approval before sending out 
to CP.  Let me know if language is ok.
Thanks,
