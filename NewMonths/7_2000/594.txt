No boy or man for that matter, me, all by myself!  No vacations for me for 
awhile - I am a little tapped out for the time! - but a ride around the block?

Very nice - now where did you say you and I are going on vacation?  I suppose 
we could make it driving trip to take advantage of your new car!!!   Did some 
boy buy that for you?

Chris,

How impersonal and Late so first - my apologies.  No excuses but this week 
has been unbelievable.  

I hope that you had an incredible Birthday - I guess you started early since 
I did try to call on Frid.  I hope it was fun.

I bought my self a new BD car!  Kind of exciting.

Today a few of us in my group are headed to the London office! So In my haste 
I wanted to be sure and at least send you a belated birthday wish.

Stephanie
