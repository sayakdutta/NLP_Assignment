Kay

I am forwarding you, at the request of Gregg Penman, a copy of the executed
Agency Agreement between WestLB and Calumet Power.  This document
supplements the ADA and Cash Collateral agreements Gregg forwarded to you
earlier today.  John Nassos also indicated to me that he will forward to you
via UPS hard copy of the three agreements.  Please feel free to call me if
you need any additional documents.  Thanks
