Bob:  I am having a stack of materials relating to Enron Corp. equity trading 
sent to your attention via Federal Express on Monday.   DO NOT READ ANYTHING 
YOU RECEIVE. 

Rex, Jim and I have been discussing the variety of Enron Corp. equity 
derivatives on ENE stock, the latest accounting issuances, ENE Board 
resolutions, confirmation templates and the like.  Rex should be contacting 
you shortly to schedule a conference call.

The package of materials MIGHT be useful when we discuss the foregoing issues 
(or, it might be totally useless!).  

Hope you have a great weekend.  Regards.  Sara
