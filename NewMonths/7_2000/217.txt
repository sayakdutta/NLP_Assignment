Richard Tomaski and Lee Fasecetti are the traders for the Park and Loans.  
The risk will reside in the Midwest Hub Book.

Please let me know the names of the internal traders who will need execute 
rights to the new Park & Loan transaction.

Hunter,

Are you going to want a separate risk book for these transactions and will we 
want this set up on EOL?

Thanks for your help.
