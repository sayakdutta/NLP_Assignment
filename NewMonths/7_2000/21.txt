As we discussed, here is a first effort at a revised TVA offer letter.  I 
drafted the Into TVA Option as a series of calls tied to the MOPA delivery 
term and quantity - not sure if this anything close to what you all had in 
mind.  Please let me know what shape you all think the offer ought to take 
and we can revise accordingly.
Thanks
