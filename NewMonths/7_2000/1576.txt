Alcoa Inc. has contacted us and would like to trade Aluminum online.  It 
appears Frank was on this initial email.  I don't know what progress, if any, 
has been made in getting the counterparty signed up online.  The person that 
contacted us is on the bottom of this email.  I will wait to see this 
counterparty come through on the Credit list.  P.S.  We do have a financial 
master in place with them in and there is nothing in it that should restrict 
metals trading.

Carol,

Tim Reyes of Alcoa would like to make sure that their current master 
agreement with Enron will encompass trading metal products, specifically, 
aluminum products on EOL.  I am hoping that you are the correct person to 
answer his question.

If you require more information Please contact Mr. Reyes at 865-594-4734.

Thank you,

Noel
