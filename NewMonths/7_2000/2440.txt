Vince -

Christy Young is the UT MBA recruiter. She is taking a couple of weeks off to 
get married and will return on July 19th as Christy Meador.  In her absence, 
I wanted to make sure we coordianted our efforts with you. 

Below are a few key UT recruiting dates. Ideally, we would like for your 
presentation to occur a week or so before our interview list is due to the 
Career Services Office. This will allow for additional candidates to submit 
their resumes for our review before we turn in the interview list.

Wed., Sept. 13 - Corporate Presentation & Reception - Alumni Center
Fri., Sept. 22 - Eye's of Texas Career Fair - Campus
Thurs., Sept. 28 - Enron Interview List due to Career Services Office
Wed., Oct. 11 - Pre-interview Reception - selected candidates only
Thurs., Oct. 12 - First Round Interviews
Fri., Oct. 13 - Second Round Interviews
Sat., Oct. 28 - Super Saturday for UT Candidates

Please let me know what works best with your schedule. Note that October 11 
is the same date as our pre-interview reception.

We look forward to working with you on this.

Thanks,
Cindy Justice

Can you guys followup with him to coordinate an Enron reception following a 
presentation that Vince Kaminiski will give during their annual UT 
Foundations of Energy Finance class.  We do want to do this, and of course 
need to coordinate with Vince and your dates on campus to ensure that we have 
no conflicts.

I am not sure if this falls into the Associate or Analyst camp.  You can best 
determine who the appropriate contact should be.  Leave me an e-mail to 
confirm.

Finance Program"



Celeste,

Greetings.

As you may recall, I am the Director of the Univ. of Texas Center for
Energy Finance (CEFER).  I would like at this time to initiate planning for
your colleague Vince Kaminski's annual presentation to the UT Foundations
of Energy Finance class which I will be presenting as usual the first half
of the Fall Semester.

Thus, to begin, I wonder whether either the above is your current e-mail
account, and, with the departure of Meryl Barnett (with whom I believe we
coordinated this in the past), whether this is an issue within your scope.

With respect to this reception, I appreciate that there may be other Enron
receptions scheduled for this Fall.  However, if you so choose, I would
like to afford you the opportunity of scheduling an Enron reception
following Vince's presentation.  If you would indeed like to do so, I
suggest we coordinate with Vince the date for the presentation/reception.

Sincerely,
Ehud
