The Gas Spec (Oil NG Hedge) book will show a MTD variance of $819,000 today.  
When the Power p&l was added to this book last week the formulas did not 
divide by 1,000.  Therefore the incorrect p&l was reported.  However, John 
Lavorato was given a corrected report, so this variance will not be included 
in today's daily p&l on the NGP&L.  

If you have any questions feel free to give me a call.

Thanks,
Robin
