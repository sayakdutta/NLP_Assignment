In order to prepare a Confidentiality Agreement, I will need the following 
information:

1.  The company's full legal name
2.  Whether we want a bilateral or Enron Protected Counterparty form
3.  What is the nature of the protected information (what project or type of 
transaction is it for)
4.  The company's address, phone number and fax number
5.  Any timing involved for getting this signed (is there a meeting Monday 
morning at 9:00 am, so it's a rush, or just send it out, we're starting to 
talk to them)
