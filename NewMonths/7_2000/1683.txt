I received a call from Judy Lee at Swiss RE (212-317-5523) regarding the 
standard confirmation we use.  She said that their legal department wishes to 
omit Section 4 on Representation.  I said I would forward it on to our legal 
department for consideration.  Below, I have attached the most recent confirm 
we sent them.  Please advise on how I should proceed.
Thanks
Scott
