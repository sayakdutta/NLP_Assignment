Lloyd,

Yes, this would be very useful. I was told that we should not do any official 
business with
MG until July 15. I don't want to violate those rules of engagement and go 
beyond casual contacts.
After the 15th all the stops are off.

No problem - I do think this could wait until MG are more closely integrated 
in any case.   A useful first step might be an email to relevant trading 
staff at MG outlining briefly what Maureen does and how she can provide a 
service to them.  Would you like me to send her a list of potential people to 
email?

Regards

Lloyd

Lloyd,

I think that we can arrange a few video conference meetings instead.
I don't see a  justification for extending the stay over the weekend if we 
have an alternative solution.

I met Maureen yesterday and had a useful discussion on her role within 
Enron.  I think it would be very helpful to promote the Research group 
function of the company, particularly given Maureen's background,  if she 
could be introduced to some of the main traders down at MG.  Unfortunately 
she won't have time to meet with MG unless we can schedule some meetings on 
Monday.

Would you be happy for her to extend her stay here till Monday to allow the 
meetings to take place?

Regards
