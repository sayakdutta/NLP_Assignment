Please format the text files to be processed through GRMS in the following 
manner.  

1) Sort by book id, then by master deal id, then by reference date.  
2) The dates must be in the following format.  4-Mar-97
3) The book names must be the same every day.  
4) If the cell should contain a number please put a zero if there is no 
value.  GRMS will not recognize a N/A in a field that is supposed to contain 
a number.
5) Please name the files in a manner consistent with those below.  

If you have any questions feel free to give me a call.

Thanks,
Robin
