The ponytail, tattoo and the beard were gone when he showed up last Monday.  
I hope somebody got some pictures of that!  SRS








Sherri,

When I got your message, I was certain I had thrown the ticket away.  But, I
was happy to find that I had procrastinated and still had it.  It will be in
the mail shortly.

The trip did go well; thanks for setting it up.

I'm curious to know whether Jeff kept the ponytail and tattoo?

Mark
