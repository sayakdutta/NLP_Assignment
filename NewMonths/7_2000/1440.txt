I'm working with the "Click Paper.com" legal team toward the migration of the 
pulp & paper trades to that website.  In oder to determine whether any of the 
counterparties that have actually traded pulp & paper online have amended the 
ETA, I need to get a list of the counterparties that have trade pulp & paper 
online.  Can someone down there prepare such a list for me?

Thanks!
