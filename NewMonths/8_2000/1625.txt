Legal has signed off on the counterparty, so I expect it is being held up 
with the online team for some reason.

Tana/Claudia --

Could you bring me up-to-date on the progress of this app?  

Thanks,

Claudia --   I see that this app is still in Legal (since 7/14).  Could you 
give me an ETA on it?

Thanks,
