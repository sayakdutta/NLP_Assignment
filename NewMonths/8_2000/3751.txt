Just being out of this nasty smog will be great.  Plus, I bet it is nice 
there when the sun goes down.  What a great time of year to make that trip.

Can you hear my heavy sighs?  It is time for me to plan something fun, even a 
short trip.  Planning and looking forward to it is 1/2 the fun.






Oh, it's nice to know I'll be missed.  It's pretty warm and humid over there 
right now, but I'm sure we'll unwind, sip wine and eat our way through the 
valley.  Don't forget we have to go so we can bring you wine that's not sold 
in Texas!!!!!!!

I'm going to miss you really badly. Are you sure you want to go to the cool 
air, unwind, sip wine and eat delicious food?  And miss all this???????




I believe this task is complete.

Could you please go through the option agreement I have in my directory on 
O.  It is under Option Agreements, and it is the only document there.  It 
should be called Fehr land option, or something similiar.  Please go search 
and make Optionor plural throughout, and make the grammar match.  I started 
making the changes, but got distracted from the task.  
Thanks,

Kay
