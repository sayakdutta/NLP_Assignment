Brent,
?
There is a way to stop the gain control from  automatically adjusting. The 
parameter that needs to be modified in?the  html file is UseAutoGainControl. 
It needs to be set to FALSE. This will stop the  volume from going down on 
Hunter's and Patrice's clients.

You might try turning off AGC (set  UseAutoGainControl to FALSE) in the 
HTML.? This should stop the mic volume  from changing.? Also check if AGC is 
set in the sound card.

Perhaps:
??? if the client is set such that the  property
???????  UseAutoGainControl=TRUE
??? then the client is attempting to adjust the microphone level  
automatically.
??? A guess on my part is that if the sound card is somehow unable  to 
automatically adjust the mike level, then an error such as the one described  
could occur (?).
?
??? Could this be the case here?
