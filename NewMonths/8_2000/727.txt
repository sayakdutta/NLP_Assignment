Lesli,

I am indeed the right person and will be happy to rebook the deals below.  
Just so you know, there are going to be several more deals that will need to 
be rebooked as soon as the CP's are set up.  If you could just let me know 
when the new CP's are set-up I will rebook the other deals as well.

Thanks,

Susan

Susan,

 If you are not the person I'm looking for could you just let me know who 
is.  If you are the right person please rebook the deals referenced below and 
let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Lesli,

Have you tried Susan Scott?  She is the Book Admin that entered these and 
she's usually very helpful.  If you can't get in touch with her, let me know 
and I'll go up and see if I can get someone on that desk to move these over.

Thanks,
Joe

Joe,

 I have been trying to get these deals rebooked and can't seem to find the 
right person.  The CP's have been set up and the deals just need to be 
moved.  Please let me know who I need to send these to if you can't help.
