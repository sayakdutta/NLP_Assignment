Completed an IT agreement with CIMA Energy, who owns 5000/day production on 
the Crawford lateral.  Gas will be transported to both the Willi Wick Farm 
Tap in the Texas panhandle area as well as to the West Texas pool.  The 
agreement is at 0.065 cents, plus fuel for 14 months beginning Sept 2000.  
This new shipper on TW will generate additional revenue (currently shipped 
under a Duke FT for 0.02).
