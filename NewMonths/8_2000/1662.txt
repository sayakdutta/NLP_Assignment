In the future, if we have a city or a county come through, we need to 
identify the state they are located in as part of the counterparty name.  The 
City of Huntsville is an example where I took it to be the the City of 
Huntsville, TX, and, per my conversation with Tom today, it appears they are 
the City of Huntsville, AL.  This isn't going to be a problem with my 
financial approval, since I shut down all cities for financial unless we have 
a master in place, but it might be a problem for power.  The same would apply 
to counties.

So, if we get cities and counties in, let's try and make the state part of 
the counterparty name.

 Leslie, do you have any problem w/Huntsville, let me know?
