Per my voice mail to Vince, Martin Lins offer letter will be provided to him 
on Thursday, August 31, 2000. 

However, a concern was shared regarding the retention bonus we originally 
discussed.  Therefore, based on his PHD and market information we are able to 
offer him a base salary of 98-100K and no retention bonus.  We can discuss 
retention bonus after he begins his manager role in your group.

If you would like to discuss further please feel free to call me.  Otherwise, 
please approve salary structure of base 98,000 with no bonus.

Thank you.
