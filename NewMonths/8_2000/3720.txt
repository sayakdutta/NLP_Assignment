That should work, since our 3:00 is being obviated by our 12:30.

It doesn't look like Friday morning will work.  How do you guys look for 
Thursday afternoon at 3:00 p.m.  We can have the meeting in EB38C1.  Please 
advise via telephone (x37340) or email asap!  Thanks!

In an effort to pull the pieces together, a meeting has been scheduled to 
discuss the draft energy and capacity contract (formerly the PPA).  It is 
scheduled for Thursday, August 24th, at 900am.  We are still in the process 
of locating a conference room, so the location is TBD.

Thanks,

Kay
