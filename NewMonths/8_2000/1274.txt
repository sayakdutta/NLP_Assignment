That works to make it more bilateral.  I think we still have the fundamenta=
l=20
problem that it is a basically flawed concept.  But that's not going to be=

fixed by drafting.

I think we need for this to be reciprocal -although I agree the errors are=

likely to be only our own.

Therefore, I suggest the following:

(f) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, any master agreement o=
r=20
any GTC to the contrary, any Transaction resulting from a Gross Error may  =
be=20
voided and the parties agree that any such voided Transaction shall be of n=

What do you think?
