Thanks for your note and glad to hear you're feeling better.  Yes we are all 
very sad about Jim's baby.  Many years ago my sister had a child who was born 
two or three months early and lived for several days - long enough to be held 
and loved - but his lungs were apparently just not developed enough and they 
couldn't save him.   I know how painful that was for them.   And I have to 
admit that experience made me very anxious when things didn't go perfectly 
for you guys that first few days. 

I received papers from Julia regarding your options a week or so ago which I 
didn't send along because the next day Julia said HR had made a mistake in 
everybody's package and HR was sending replacement documents - I haven't 
received the replacements yet but will ask.

Stephanie has started and seems to be fitting in as far as I can tell at this 
stage.  We're all super busy but more or less keeping up with the critical 
stuff.  We'll look forward to seeing you soon.
