All:  Before Rod became a Brit, we were working with Enron Corp. treasury to 
put in place some masters in the name of ENA for the following parties:

Bear, Stearns Internaitonal Limited
Credit Agricole Indosuez
CSFB International
Lehman Brother Finance S.A.
Morgan Stanley Capital Services Inc.
Deutsche Bank

These masters will be used to for equity deals on ENE stock.  The Treasury 
group has concluded together with Rex Rogers and V&E, that Enron Corp. is the 
appropriate swap counterparty for these masters and NOT ENA.

Who in credit will be available to assist me in this process?  Thanks.  Sara
