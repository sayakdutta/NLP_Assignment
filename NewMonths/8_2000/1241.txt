Hi Brent, I have been in contact with Dale Neuner regarding the creation of 
the Product Types for Argentina, by now he has all the necessary information. 
We will need your approval on the wording that was suggested for the long 
description and other legal sign-off. I have already gone through the product 
descriptions with Andrea and no mayor comments came up. Regarding Natural Gas 
products, her comments were that we are creating a Firm product with TOP 
100%, but that is OK. Then on the additional information like delivery 
points, term, currency and unit of measure, all those alternatives have been 
given to Dale for him to load into the system.
Please give me an update on your timetable for these issues.
Regards

Patrick
