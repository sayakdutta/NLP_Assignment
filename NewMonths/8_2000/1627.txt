Yes, the only weather representations we need are now always covered in the 
confirmation.  As far as thru what entity they trade, I support whatever 
Lotus Notes says.

There does not appear to be anything that would prevent us from trading 
weather derivatives under this master.  There is a weather represenation that 
should be added to the confirmations but other than that there are no other 
modifications that I know of.  (Tana please let me know if I am wrong.)  Just 
as an aside I noted in the database that it appears that a little over a year 
an a half ago the cp wanted to do all physical and finanacial trading through 
Hess Energy Services Company LLC.  Did anything come of this?  I do not 
believe a master was signed for this entity.  I just want to confirm that 
Hess Energy Trading Company LLC is the active trading entity.

Thanks,
Brent

Brent,  we have an ISDA with this company (executed early 1998).  Does it 
need any modifications in order to trade weather derivatives under it?  I'm 
not sure if the standard ISDA works or if it  needs an amendment for special 
weather definitions.  I am assuming you are handling weather based on your 
handling the new weather/insurance/transformer stuff...if not, please pass 
along to whomever is handling.  Thanks so much for your help.
