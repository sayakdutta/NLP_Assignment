Dear GEICO,

I have no idea who those people are that are identified in your email.  I 
would be interested in knowing how some random peoples' driving incidents are 
some how associated with me and my insurance application.  I have never had 
an insurance claim.  Please feel free to contact me with any further 
questions.

Mathew Smith
