It looks to me like the market for distributed computing will displace heavy 
iron within the next several years.  The structure is still very early in its 
development, but I think there will be commercial opportunities for Enron in 
bandwidth and electricity.  I would be interested to know what issues you two 
would see as the greatest hinderences and possibilities for these markets.  
If you would like, please feel free to comment on the attached documents.

Thanks,
Mark
