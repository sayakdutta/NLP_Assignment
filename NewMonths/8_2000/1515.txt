i probably will party tomorrow b/c it is going to be the best day of work 
ever.  i actually kind of interviewed at csfb in nyc.  that would be huge if 
you got a job with them.  i know two guys that work there.   if you are in 
banking you better get used to 80-100 hours a week.  talk to you later 
holmes.
