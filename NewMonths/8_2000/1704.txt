Per my conversation with Frank, this counterparty wants to trade weather 
online.  However, they have the old style ERMS Master in place which only 
covers energy commodities.  I spoke to Scott Tackett on the Confirm Desk, and 
he is going to add language to the confirm that puts the trades under the 
master agreement.   I also spoke to Tanya Rohauer in Credit and she is going 
to move this counterparty up on the list for an ISDA replacement master.

So, they are OK to open for weather.
