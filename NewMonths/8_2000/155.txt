Bob Chandler and I request some changes inorder to detail the upfront 
payment.  If you do not have any problems with the document, please advise 
and we will notify Gerald to create executables.

Thanks,
James

Attached is the letter.  I am forwarding per Mark's request.  Let me know if 
you have any comments.  If everything looks good, let me know and I will 
create executables.  Thanks.
