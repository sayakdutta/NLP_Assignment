Yes.  Sara

P.S.  Can you call me and let me know what products you are looking to trade 
online.

In addition to the Buy Side Direct agreement noted below, I am looking at 
several other online trading sites for corporate bonds.  For assistance in 
reviewing related agreements, should I work with you ?   

Thanks.

I recently joined Jeff Kinneman's group and have been asked to participate in 
the evaluation of various internet trading platforms.  Is your area reviewing 
agreements / legal issues related to the Buy Side Direct site or its parent 
Intelligent Markets ?  Could I get an update on the status of this review and 
any outstanding issues ?

Thanks.
