Jonny,

Thank you so much for the email and kind words.  I was very moved by it and 
you know I feel the same way.  I have become very reflective with the more 
"success" that I have been fortunate enough to receive.  I am so thankful and 
appreciative and although I have always been religious and spiritual, it has 
grown more deeply.  I see so many people that have lost their perspective and 
I pray that I will remain grounded and truly appreciate the blessings that 
our family has received.  Chris and I often discuss how we can help others 
and what can we do to really make a difference.  

The Jones and the McConnells are truly very lucky.   Thanks, and give my love 
to your family.

Mike


PS:  What about OU - Texas, do you have any ideas or plans already in the 
works?  









Sometimes we fail to stop and reflect on events which are of significance
because we are so busy with our heads down accomplishing the things we
strive for.  I hope you are taking a moment to reflect and enjoy the
incredible accomplishments which you have achieved at such a young age.  You
and I are two of the luckiest people in the world and must always remember
to give back what we have been so fortunate to receive.

Congratulations and keep up the good work.  I am proud to call you my
friend.


Jonny
