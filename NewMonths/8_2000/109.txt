Mr. Enloe -

Ken Lay asked me to let you know that regrettably he will be in Europe, so 
unable to attend the dinner.

Rosalee














I would like to request that you reserve the evening of Friday, September
29, 2000 for a dinner in New York honoring Ben Rosen as he retires from the
board of Compaq Computer Corporation.

Further details (time, location, etc.) will follow.

Please reply to this email ASAP and let me know your availability.

Thanks, Ted
