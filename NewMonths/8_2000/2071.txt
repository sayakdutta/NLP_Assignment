Shmuel,

The date of our trip to Berkeley has been set. It will be October 16th and 
17th
(Monday and Tuesday).

I shall be glad to make a presentation on energy derivatives markets 
(development of the markets in the US and Europe, valuation difficulties, 
Enron's role
in developing the forward markets for natural gas and electricity).

Please, let me know if this topic would be of interest to you. If this is the
case, I shall follow with a title and an abstract.

By the way, are you free for dinner on Monday?

Vince









Great. Our seminars are 3:30 to 5PM. If it works for you please send me a
title and abstract.
