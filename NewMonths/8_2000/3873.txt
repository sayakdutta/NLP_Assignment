After I wrote this I recall Ed saying that we don't have a New York company 
yet.

I'm fairly comfortable that I don't know  whether there really is an 
Edgecombe Development Company, and if so, is it available to use on the 
Virginia Power transaction.

Sorry for the memory slip.

I don't recall  the answer was to the question about whether we have a land 
company in New York?  And if so, its name?

Thanks,

Kay






OK.  We'll standby until you give us additional instructions.
