O.K.  Just wanted to see if we're still on for Saturday night.  Let me know 
if anyone else wants to come because I think I'm just going to order the 
tickets today over the phone or on the internet.  Also, I was trying to 
remember how much I covered of your meal the other night at Sabroso's.  I 
think it was around $15, so if it's okay with you I'll just pay for your 
ticket and then take the difference from the amount you sent in that email 
and cut you a check for that amount (I know I'm very delinquent).  I promise 
I'm good for the money.  Also, was wondering if you're still interested in 
the Bruce Cockburn concert on the 11th.  Just let me know.  Hope your having 
a wonderful day.
