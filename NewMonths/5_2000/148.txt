Jeff, didn't realize everyone else was going to use narrative format.  Now 
that I've had a chance to think about it, I think ours will look silly if 
it's in Q&A format.  I'll work on changing it this evening.

Thanks Jeff.?? Your testimony is in the Q&A format, not the narrative, but 
I'm not certain that will be a problem.? Originally, I was thinking we would 
package the testimony here and send them out to the ALJ in a one-piece 
package.? Because I'm not sure we will be able to do that logistically given 
the last minute changes I expect, we may all just file separately.? I'll let 
you know Mon-Tues what we decide.

Brian, 
I'm forwarding to you the first draft of Transwestern's GIR testimony.? As 
you can see, there are several holes yet to be filled in, particularly with 
respect to cites/references.? However, as concerns content, I'd appreciate 
any comments/proposed changes anyone would like to offer here.? I'm not 
sure if I have the latest Email distribution list, so please feel free to 
forward this on to anyone I've inadvertently left off.? Thanks.
