Carol:  Laurel Adams was wondering whether any of the paralegal candidates 
who we interviewed might have a good background for "back office" duties.  I 
have no idea whether salaries are comparable but she needs someone who can 
spot issues and learn the confirm process at the same time (if no experience 
in the confirmation area).  What do you think?  Sara
