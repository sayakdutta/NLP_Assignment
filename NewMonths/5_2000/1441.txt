     Sara,
     I've been calling both your number and Kay Ellis' number and have not
     gotten answers or voicemail recordings.  I would like to speak to you
     to resolve the outstanding Set-off issue as soon as possible.  I will
     be in the office for the rest of the day today but will be out next
     Tuesday and Wednesday, returning Thursday, June 1st.  I hope we can
     get together today.

     I look forward to hearing from you and I will keep trying as well.
     Regards,
     Marty Oelmann
