Michael,

It's a cottage industry and nobody can read all that's
published.  The Journal of Derivatives and
the Journal of Finance are two primary publications I would recommend.

Hi Grant and Vince,

What do you think of the Journal of Derivatives?  Would you recommend a
subscription?  If not, which publication would you suggest?

Thanks,
Michael

I recently received a brochure for the Journal of Derivatives.  This 
quarterly publication is put out by Institutional Investor, Inc. and the 
International Association of Financial Engineers.  It claims to provide the 
latest in both theory and application of derivative instruments.  PGE does 
not currently subscribe to this publication.  Do you think that your 
respective departments could benefit from the subscription?  The cost is 
$200/yr. and would be split by the number of departments (if any) interested.

Let Patrick or myself know if you are interested.

Thanks
Jay T.
