 I have a standing meeting at that time but I don't need to be on the call.  
Thanks.  Sara

Due to Randy Young's trip this evening, the above meeting needs to be 
rescheduled to tomorrow afternoon. Please let me know if  2:00 p.m. Houston 
time/4:00 p.m. Brazil time works for you.

Thanks in advance,
Elizabeth.
