Shari:  When you get back after vacation and have caught up, give me a call 
to chat about the NYISO pricing.  Elizabeth suggested that we coordinate our 
efforts to capture extreme pricing revisions and negative pricing issues.  
Our power confirms currently include a modified version of Section 7.3 (of 
the 1993 ISDA Commodity Derivatives Definitions) in our omnibus confirms for 
price changes.  I am still tracking third party paper.  Thanks.  Sara
