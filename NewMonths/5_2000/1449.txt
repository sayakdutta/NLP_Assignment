Jeff and Larry:  Last year, Mary Gosnell prepared a one page summary which 
was used by legal and credit to target the preparation of ISDA Master 
Agreements.  The summary was divided into two parts:  "Without Master 
Agreements" and "With ECT Master Agreements" and included the number of 
trades for the first half of the year.  It is our objective once again to put 
new agreements into place and upgrade existing ECT Master Agreements to ISDA 
Master Agreements.  I don't know if EOL trades have impacted the numbers this 
year and I'm not sure whether we need to create a line item for EOL (I'll 
leave that to your discretion).  Please let me know if you have any 
questions.  Thanks.  Sara

P.S.  We were very successful in negotiating masters appearing on Mary's 
list!
