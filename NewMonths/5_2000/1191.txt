I understand that you are the Keyspan man!!

We are being asked to look at combined physical/financial guaranty for 
Keyspan with the guarantor being KeySpan Corporation d/b/a KeySpan Energy and 
the guaranteed parties being KeySpan Ravenswood Inc. and KeySpan Ravenswood 
Services.  I have never seen this counterparty as a financial entity before.  
We've got Keyspan Energy Management, Inc. as a counterparty we sent a draft 
master to about a year ago.  Will these Ravenswood entities trade financial 
with us?  Do we need to add Keyspan Energy Management to the guaranty if that 
is indeed the Keyspan entity we are trading with?

By the way, what kind of boondoggle trip is this you are on?  You Credit guys 
live high on the hog!  You must have a bigger budget than us!
