All:  I received a phone call from Gary Ordway asking when he could receive 
draft documentation.  Has anyone prepared credit?  Thanks.  Sara

All:  I received a request from PPM to send our form of ISDA to document 
trading.  We previously sent a draft to these guys on 1/13/99.  The only 
difference is that they now want to trade and the Scottish Power acquisition 
is done.  The contact is:
