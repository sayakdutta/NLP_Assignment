Rod:  And what lawyer is handling this in your presence?  This is beginning 
to sound like Koch and all of the Koch separate trading entities!!!!  My 
brain is full now.

Rod/Sara: last week we met with Capex and everything is advancing very well.
They see the signing of the ISDA as a very simple process, as they have 
several of them signed. But we need to take into account the following:
They want to sign 2 ISDAs, 1 with CAPEX and another one with CAPSA, because 
LPG, Oil and power are traded from the different entities
They have a Fiduciary Assignment Agreement with IFC that we need to look at 
and if necessary add some language in the ISDA

We are sending you the IFC Agreement for your review and comment. It will go 
by courrier cause of it's length. Once you receive it pls. review, and if we 
need to discuss anything with Capex, coordinate with Patrick to arrange a 
conference call.
Patrick will be involved in the process as he needs to fully understand the 
ISDA document due to EOL which is scheduled to  come on later this year.

Sara, we will need an ISDA for CAPSA as well. It will be identical to the 
CAPEX I believe. Rod pls provide your input to Sara on credit for Capsa, 
considering the no threshold issue.
