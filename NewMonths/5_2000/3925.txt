Zimin,

I have a copy of the article.
I agree with you. The model is
essentially the same (in intentions).

I shall distributed the copy of the paper
to the trades here. It explains  
well the logic behind the model and it's
an independent source.

Vince, 

I got the article.  I can make a copy for you when I get back.
The article is pretty much for marketing purpose.   My reading
from that paper is as follows:

1. solve optimal exercise bounday using stocastic DP;
2. runing price trajectory to tracking storage level to give average storage 
cycling;

Our model addresses the same issues,  althrough maybe the implementation is
not quite the same. 

I will fax to you if I can find the article here.

Regards,

Zimin

Zimin,

There was an interesting article on gas storage modeling
by people from Camminus in the March issue
of Energy and Power Risk Management.
Please, see if you can get this article.

Vince and Stinson,

I am in the London office this week. Things are quite nice here.  My host 
Anjam arranged a full itinerary for me.
Tuesday is reserved for Anjam to talk about various subjects including 
inflation modeling, power vol curve,
mean reverting price & vol model, and I will talk about the spot and 
multi-factor models, XLL. Wednesday, I
will concentrate on the gas storage model with  Natasha Danilochkina. 
Thursday and Friday I will talk to 
Haakan Olafsson, Mark Jones, Anjam, and Natasha about UK gas forward curve 
simulation, gas swing model,
and implementation issues of UK virtural storage model.   I will give you a 
full report when I get back.

It is cold and rainy here in London. It makes me feel sunny and hot Houston 
actually is not that bad.


Zimin
