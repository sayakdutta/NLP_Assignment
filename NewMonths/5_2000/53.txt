Hi, Kristin.  Your Dad asked me to write you and suggest that the two of you 
meet for lunch tomorrow at Grotto on Westheimer at 1:00 p.m.  They don't take 
reservations, but the lunch crowd should have cleared out by that time.  Let 
me know if that's ok with you or if you decide not to drive and need him to 
pick you up.

Have a good time.  SRS
