Greetings Severin:

No, I'm not writing inquiring about employment as a research analyst (despite Enron's woes, which I'm sure you've been reading about).  

However, my fiancee, Prentice Sellers, who got her MBA from Haas last May, is actively looking for work at an interesting place.  I wanted to let you know that she has applied for a position at the consulting firm that you're affiliated with.  

Forgive the less-than-objective plug, but she's extremely bright and talented and did very well at Haas. Prior to attending Haas, she worked at LECG, where she was highly praised for her work and consistently got rave reviews.

She'd be a valuable asset to the firm and is worth giving a serious look.

Thanks for reading this paid advertisment.

On another note, I thought the Hoover conference was extremely good.  You and Sweeney did a great job.  What was your impression?  I've noticed that it got some decent press.

Best,
Jeff
