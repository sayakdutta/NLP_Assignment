Jim,

Thanks for your patience.
Greg is quite busy right now.
I saw him this morning and  told
him that I would like to schedule
a separate meeting to discuss your proposal.
Hopefully, this will happen later this week.

I am forwarding your request to Jay Webb
who is in charge of the EOL system.

I shall let you know as soon as I can
if we can give you a visitor account.

Vince

 

Sure you are busy.  Sorry about the troubles.

Would it be possible for us to get a read-only account for Enron Online
so that we can monitor things?
