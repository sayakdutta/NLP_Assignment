I looked at it today on the plane.  I don't see any issues although we are in the middle of budget process and will see if this impacts this request.

Jim,

Have you had any chance to look at the information I sent to you regarding my attending classes to complete my degree?  I am about halfway through my first class, and want to make sure Enron is onboard with me doing so.

Thanks,
