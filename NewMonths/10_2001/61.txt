I know it seems gimmicky- but we sould keep a jar, and every time you get mad, I could put
a penny in it, and you can decide every day if I have treated you like enough of a princess to
take one out. Whatever is left after a month or so, we would take a getaway of however many
pennies are in the jar (not funded by the pennies, of course). This would really show how much
things have not gone your way, and would be a reminder for me.
We could also set up a Jay jar, but I guess that would be less full.
I am brainstorming to try to get myself to behave, so I know it's corny.

Also, I like the VIrginias and Carolinas, but we should go together when we go.
And I think of you as my partner every day, and I'm sorry I take it for granted.

 


I have an overwhelming need to leave. I am highly frustrated, but you don't seem to listen. I am tired. I need to do something about the situation, because it is NOT improving. I am tired of bitching, complaining, criticizing, being hurt, and most of all not being taken care of. You do not treat me like a friend half the time, much less a partner. I really think that I need to go where I am going to stay and establish my adult life. I think that the Virginias or Carolinas would be a nice place, because of the climate, location, schools, etc. I would like to go there, establish residency, and maybe go to school. Otherwise, I would just like to leave, by a house, and build a little bit of security. 
I need something. 
I need to stop fighting with you and do something with my life.

I love you and although I am seemingly incorrigible, I listen to your 
criticisms. 
By now you should know that you can trust me through thick and thin. 
Besides, you told Josh 2 weeks ago that you liked being with me, despite 
our stubborn differences. I listened to you then also. 
Let's get real, over the long haul, we have too much in the way of common 
interests, beliefs, and interesting times. I think we should just invoke a 
pact 
to talk more without getting angry. We are not moving yet. When we leave 
Houston, we are leaving together, so unpack your UHaul. 
Love, 
Jason 
P.S. Also, I expect you to do some holiday visiting with me, 
and vice versa.
