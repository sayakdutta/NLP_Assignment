Kim,
Thanks so much for your patience.
I have been busier than busy.
I do want to talk with you regarding Big Sandy.
The project is currently in its appeal process with the ACC...hopefully will
know yeah/neigh later today or tomorrow.
I will endeavor to buzz you tomorrow (I am in my Irvine office today, with a
full slate of meetings).
Regards,
Kirk

As per our phone conversation, here is the revised Delivery Point

have some time on Monday or Tuesday when you are in Houston and Ron and
I can review this with you.  If we don't connect up in person, then let
