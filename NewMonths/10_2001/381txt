Just wondered if anyone has noticed any change in EnPower performance?  See e-mail below.

All,  This past weekend, additional performance related changes to the EnPower production environment were implemented.

Our database environment was upgraded from a 32-bit version of Oracle 8.1.7.2 to the 64-bit version.  This upgrade increases the maximum size of memory cache available to our applications from 4Gb to 25Gb.  Apps that cache large amounts of data will experience reductions in physical I/O thereby increasing application speed.

Once again, this change represents one of many short-term steps to improve the performance of our core wholesale trading system.  I'll continue to send out notifications as these changes are implemented.

We will review the complete set of short and long-term performance related improvements in an upcoming architecture review meeting TBA. 

Glad to discuss.

Steve
