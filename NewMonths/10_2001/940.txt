Oh - never mind - haven't they heard of a fax?

It'll happen

 

Well...

Due to calendar conflicts at Utilicorp, their President, Jim Miller and the Vice-President of the Utilicorp Utilities, Gail McMinn, will not be together and execute documents until next Monday, October 8.  The have an internal approval process similar to our DASH and they could not get all parties to execution by today.  

None of us like delays, but I remain extremely positive and assured on this transaction.
