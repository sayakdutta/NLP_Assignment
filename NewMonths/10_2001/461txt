Will and I are planning a  little get together for Jeff's birthday - here are the  details:
 
 
 
When:      Monday October 15th  
Time:        6:30  pm 
Place:       Goode Company Barbque -  on Kirby  
 
 
 
Come join us on Monday night to  celebrate Jeff's 30th birthday (he actually turns 30 on the 13th, but we will be  in College Station).  We will be at Goode Company most of the evening so if  you can stop by for a beer with the birthday boy.  I know he would love to  see all of you.
 
Please email me back and let me know  if you can stop by - and feel free to forward this on to anyone I may have left  off.
 
See you Monday,
 
Deanna and Will
