Jonathan:

The attached document is governed by English law and subject to SFA rules and regulations.  Could you please take a quick look at the SFA provisions and let me know if you have any comments?  The SFA references appear in the following paragraphs of the Terms of Business:

page 2	-	2.2
page 4	-	4.2
page 5	-	7.3
page 10	-	12.5
page 16	-	5.1 (of Part III)
Page 18-	7.9

Also, I'm uncertain of the following:

page 13-	1.2 	Is this "best execution" language alright?
page 17-	7.3	Is the "further assurance" language appropriate for perfection of a security interest in Collateral (in England)?
page 28-	Schedule 3	Are these "LIFFE" terms fairly standard?
Appendix	This Appendix contains provisions for documenting CFD's.  Can't these be documented under an ISDA?

Please let me know if you have any questions.  And, thanks for your generous assistance.

Sara
