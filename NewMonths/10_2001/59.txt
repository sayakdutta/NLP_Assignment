I do not think it was a price revision, hence I would like to see all the deals from the last half of the month.  I think some deals might have entered into the system incorrectly.  I will contact Warrick to see what deals he shows in the system.

Paul,

We have already finalized Sept. P&L....our deadline was 5 p.m. yesterday.  Therefore, any changes from what was issued yesterday will simply come back to you in a flash adjustment at the end of this month or the following month.  Its possible that price revisions occurred which were not picked up by the download in Enpower.

Thanks.

Casey,
I reconciled my P&L and I am off from your final P&L number for the month.

I am showing a Profit of ~ $596,000 ? however I flowed approx 68,000 MW which would incur a charge of ($136,000).  Therefore my final P&L number should be ~ $460,000.

Your final showed $341,000.

Please give me a call.
