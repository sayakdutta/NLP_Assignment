Cara,
Sounds good but...we had to change the night to November 30th...I'm sorry. Hopefully it still works for you guys. Did you want to get rooms as well. If so just speak with Jill Chatterton. More to follow.

The 4 of us are confirmed to go, please add us to the list and send me the details.

Thanks,
