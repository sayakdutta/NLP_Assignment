i am going to stay in.  i need to find a house.

 

Are you going in or stay here? May not be bad to save a trip since it is
supposed to rain (50%) during the game. Then again, if we win, it would be
one that I'd be pissed for missing. If you drive in, my mom will have some
gumbo for us on Sunday.

Thanks,

Mitch Marcantel
