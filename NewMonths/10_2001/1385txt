Agreed.  Karen, can you and I talk briefly before you call Ken? Thanks.
 
Best,

It's ultimately PR's call, but my vote would be not to extend.

Just a reminder that the contract we signed with Ken Smith is set to expire at the end of October. Contract terms allow for renewal, or extension, by written agreement of the parties.  


Commencing on May 1, 2001 Enron agreed to pay Ken $4000/month at a maximum of 25 hours/month.  Hours worked in excess of 25/month are paid at a rate of $160/hour. 


Termination of the contract requires that Enron give Ken Smith 30 days advance notice.  
  
If we choose to terminate, I suggest that Karen Denne contact Ken by telephone and also provide written notice of the termination immediately (unless you all agree that we should extend the contract).


Please let me and Karen know how you want to proceed by close of business Thursday. Thanks
