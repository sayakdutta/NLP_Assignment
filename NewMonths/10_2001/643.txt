Jeff,

do you have a copy of the contract that we have with EARMS that Chris Foster was working on with Citizens earlier in the summer?  Let me know if you have any questions.  I need a copy in order to assist with getting EARMS paid.

thanks,

Kim

 

I checked my file and I do not have one.  Check with Jeff Hodge.  I am pretty sure he has one.

Chris,

Can you send or fax me a copy of the contract between us/Citizens and EARMS?  I don't have a copy and i need one in order to get these invoices processed.

thanks,

Kim
