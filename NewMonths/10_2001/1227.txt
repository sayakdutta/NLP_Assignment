Krishna,
FYI
 

Vince,  In general, such applications for green cards go through Margaret Daffin in HR.  She is going to check on the status and get back with us.  We then can determine how to proceed.  Michelle

Margaret -- I guess this should be in your court.  Would you mind looking into it?  Thanks.  Michelle

 

Michelle,

It was based on work needs, exceptional talent.

Vince,

What was the basis for his green card?  Was it family-based, or was it based on work needs?
