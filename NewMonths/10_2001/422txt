Nick,

I would like 3 red poinsettias.

Thanks,
Stacey

 

The Bayou City Dance Company is once again selling poinsettias as a fundraiser.  This is the dance company for 10-18 year olds for which my wife, April, is the Director.  They are selling the poinsettias for $8.50 each and they are pretty good size (about 12-18 inches tall from what I remember).  Just like last year, I will deliver the flowers to the Enron building (or at least to the Enron garage).

They come in red, white, or pink, but I think the red were by far the healthiest and longest lasting.

The order are due by next Friday, so please let me know if you would like to order (and how many).

Thanks.

- Nick
