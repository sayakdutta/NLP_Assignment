So when does Tara have to commit to Big E?

Can you clean my boat? It has this crusty, fishy stuff on the bottom of the hull.

 

No dillweed. Just building them. Tara got her offer from Enron. It's pretty
nice. Are you still working 547 hours per week?




Cards win indeed. I like them for the series.
Are you cleaning fishing boats, too?




    
            
   Hey there cheese dick. How's life in H-Town? This is my new work e-mail.
   I'm
   doing accounting work at this boat manufacturer. If you're in the market
   for
   a nice fishing boat you let me know. Capron filled me in on your quest
   for a
   Vegas trip. Doesn't look good. Due to my recent bout of unemployment, I
   don't think gambling would be a good use of my available fundage. Tara
   and I
   will be in Houston Nov. 15th thru 18th for Curry's wedding. Plan on
   throwing
   back a few that weekend when we get some spare time. Are you and Beth
   together or apart at this time? I really could just flip a coin and get
   as
   accurate an answer as you would give me, huh? Take it easy hombre. Go
   Cards!
