Ed,

I got your fax.

Thanks for your kind words about Enron. Every business
hits turbulence from time to time but I am not losing
sleep over it.

I am a bit concerned about the last two paragraphs
and references to LTCM and MG. I am afraid they can be taken out
of context and misinterpreted.

Thanks

 

yes, that's happened to us before. The fax is on its way. I'll be going home
soon to go to one of my kid's events so we can talk or correspond by email
at your convenience. Bye..

Ed


old fashioned way!

Ed,

713 646 2503.

The file comes across as winmail.dat   not as a .doc file
or a  .pdf file. It happens in the case of some
E-mail systems: the files get encoded and then they don't
get decoded correctly.
