just did.  let me know what she says.

 

you better not.  you better not EVER tell anyone about that.




oh.   that is different than your first response. quite different.  i am
going to email your friend jen and see what she thinks.

    
            
   ok, she didn't say she was ugly, she said she saw a resemblance between
   us
   but that i was smaller and better than her.  i agree with her.

   
            

   your mom didn't say she was ugly.  stop lying.  i think that girl is hot
   so
   i don't care.

       
                        Subject:

      well, i asked my mom if she thinks i look like that bonnie girl and
   she
      thinks you are insane and that i should never talk to you again for
      insulting me so badly.  i told you that girl was ugly.
