Diann --

I agree with Bob.  Please let us know as soon as possible if SCE is willing to discuss this fairly.  

Jeanne -- 

I guess that we would update our Complaint if need be?

Thanks,

Jim

 


Diann, would you start the dialogue with your contacts and see if it gets fixed?  Thanks.

 


Bob, how should we handle this?  Should Sue Mara, Jeane or I contact SCE concerning the late fees?

Diann -- properly disputed charges are not suppose to be subject to late
fees.






Jeane, I have evidence on some DA bills where SCE has assessed late fees on
disputed bills.  I haven't been able to do a thorough analysis, but knowing
the amount we have disputed so far, the charges could be substantial.

I understood that, until the CPUC makes a decision, the UDC can not charge
late fees on disputed bills.  Correct?
