I love you and although I am seemingly incorrigible, I listen to your criticisms.
By now you should know that you can trust me through thick and thin.
Besides, you told Josh 2 weeks ago that you liked being with me, despite
our stubborn differences. I listened to you then also. 
Let's get real, over the long haul, we have too much in the way of common
interests, beliefs, and interesting times. I think we should just invoke a pact
to talk more without getting angry. We are not moving yet. When we leave
Houston, we are leaving together, so unpack your UHaul.
Love,
Jason

P.S. Also, I expect you to do some holiday visiting with me,
and vice versa.
