that is probably what i will end up doing.  i need to find some really nice smelling oil though.

 


They have gay people at LaStada??? 
J/K - I'm not sure why they are going there.  They said that there is a big 
party tonight.  But I think some people are going to Sierra also. 
I was hoping you'd be in your chipendale costume.  :) 
 
the only thing at la strada is a bunch of nancy boys.  are your friends 
trying to meet gay guys or are they gay? 
     
               I'll let you know.  Sierra would be fun. 
   My roommate and her friends are going to LaStrada....I'm not sure what 
   is going on there. 
   We'll have to come up with a costume if we go out. 
    

            i don't want to be a soilder during the war.  where are you going if you 
   go 
   out?  sierra?  let me knwo if you decide to go out b/c i think it would 
   be 
   a fun night. 
        
                              i haven't decided if i'm going out or not either. 
      do you want to borrow my GI Jane outfit?  :) 
       



                        i might go out.  i don't think that i am dressing up.  are you going 
      out? 
      i would be up for going out, but i have nothing to dress up in.
