Funny.

 

I spoke with Parquet and Mcdonald re contracts and offered the following:

Parquet:
Base - $200 - no increase
Signing - $100
Equity - $250

Mcdonald:
Base - $175 - no increase
Signing - $75
Equity - $200

Parquet's is identical to what you offered; Mcdonald is significantly less than Parquet and right in between Parquet and Dyer (50/150).

In line with the rest of the organisation

Louise -

David Parquet is currently on an employment agreement which expires on 12/1/2001.  Chris would like to be proactive in signing Dave up again for another 2 years.  

Dave's current contract details are:

Base:		$200,000 (due to SF cost of living)
Equity:		$100,000 equity (50/50) on 1/1/00
Equity:		$100,000 equity (50/50) on 1/1/01

Chris is proposing:

Base:  		$215,000 (or $200,000 with a COLA payment of $15,000 for each year of term)
Signing: 	$100,000
Equity:		$350,000 (50/50)

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks!
Amy
