i am all hot and bothered.

 

ok, but i have to approve them first.




oh my god!  i am all worked up here at work.  i am going to find you a
hottie right now.

    
            
   absolutely.

   
            

   does that mean you would do it even if i didn't win $80million

       
                        
      disgusting, i wouldn't do it.  you'd have to pick someone really
      attractive
      and then i would do it.

      
                        

      i thought it was.  i think that girl is hot.  if i won $80million
   that
      is
      the girl i want you to hook up with.

          
                                    
         that's not nice.  you should compliment me.  that was not a
      compliment
         though.  nice try.

         
                                    

         whatever.  i try to be nice and pay you a compliment and you turn
   it
      on
         me.
         i guess i will just never compliment you again.

             
                                                
            whatever, you're mean

            

                                    

            those photos are all stretched out.  i can't believe you don't
      think
         she
            is
            pretty

                
                                                            
                i'm not kidding, i honestly, 100%, do not think she is
   pretty
      and
         am
               insulted by the comparison.

               

                                             

               whatever.  i think you are messing around and you probably
   love
         the
               comparisson.

                   
                                                                        
                  she does look like a man, she's hideous.  you are ruining
   my
         day.

                  

                                                      

                  http://www.bonniebernstein.freeservers.com/

                  this is the site and she doesn't look like a man.  danm
   it.

                      

                                                               
                     yes, you have to type in her name where it says search
      and
         then
               her
                  site
                     will come up.  it is definitely her b/c that picture
   you
         sent
            me
               is
                  on
                     it.
                     she looks like a man.

                     

                                                               

                     are you sure you are looking at the correct one b/c i
      don't
         see
               her
                  on
                     yahoo.  i think you are lying b/c she is not gross.

                         

                                                                        
                        i just searched for her on yahoo.com and a site
   came
      up
         with
            a
                  bunch
                     of
                        pictures of her.  gross, gross, gross.

                        

                                                                        

                        where did you look her up?  i dont know what you
   are
         talking
               about
                     b/c
                        she
                        is skinny and pretty.

                            


                                                                                 
                           that may not be a good picture but i just looked
      her
         up
            and
               saw
                  a
                        bunch
                           of
                           pictures and she is gross in all of them.  she's
      big
         too.

                           

                                                                                 

                           she isn't gross .  she is hot.  you need to see
   her
      on
            tv.
                  like i
                        said,
                           that is not a great pic.

                               


                                                                                          
                              she's gross, thanks a lot.  i look better
   than
      her.

                              this is a photo of the girl i think you look
      like
         but
            it
                  isn't
                        really
                           a
                              good pic.

                                  


                                                                                                   
                                 what are you talking about??

                                 

                                                                                                   

                                 if you act enthusiastic(sp?) then you'll
   be
                     enthusiastic(sp?)!

                                    about
