What travel dates did you have in mind?  I think you said you wanted to leave 
NY for London on the evening of the 16th (arriving Saturday morning), but 
when do you want to go to NY?  Let me know & I'll give Lillie a call.

Sounds good to me. 



Scott:

What would you think about the week of April 19 for Tana's visit to London?
