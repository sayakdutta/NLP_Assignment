This is your last chance to spend Easter with us in this millennium.  Amanda 
and I will be in DC on Saturday and then we are going to the Inn at Little 
Washington outside of DC for Sunday dinner.  Why don't you two Texans charter 
a jet and come on in?  It will make a splash with the locals.  Amanda can 
introduce you around the law school and upgrade her own standing in the 
community.
