Looks good to me.  Are we certain that all of the other traders plan to post 
daily volumes?

That looks fine to me. Please ensure the Volume tab is consistent with this 
description as well.

Mark: Please comment if you have any concerns.

Thanks,

Dave

the current paper descriptions says:

"....Seller pays a Floating Price and the Buyer pays the price submitted by 
Counterparty on the website (the Fixed Price) in each case in respect of the 
Notional Quantity per Determination Period.  Each calendar month during the 
term of the Transaction will be a Determination Period. The Notional Quantity 
per Determination Period is the volume submitted multiplied by the number 
days in the relevant Determination Period."

suggestion:

"....Seller pays a Floating Price and the Buyer pays the price submitted by 
Counterparty on the website (the Fixed Price) in each case in respect of the 
Notional Quantity per Determination Period.  Each calendar month during the 
term of the Transaction will be a Determination Period. The Notional Quantity 
per Determination Period is the volume submitted by Counterparty on the 
website."

If you all agree, I'll make this change in the BlackMaster. Dave, it may need 
lawyers validation?

Paper volumes are actually per month not per day in each determination 
period. We need to change the long descriptions.
