A vendor with whom we do a lot of business with called me today and brought 
to my attention a very close copy of our patented "E."  Pinnacle West (the 
holding company parent of Arizona Public Service) has a subsidiary, El Dorado 
Investment Company, who has a logo consisting of a three-dimensional capital 
E turned on 45 deg. angle.  You can access the website at 
www.pinnaclewest.com and then go to the Who We Are page to review.

Just thought you'd like to know!
