Paul Simons will be attending the legal conference in Houston on 28th/29th 
October.  Paul has asked if it would be possible to have some time with you 
during his visit.  Would it be possible to meet sometime on Tuesday 26th or 
Wednesday 27th October?  I would be grateful if you could let me know when 
would be convenient (assuming you are in the office on those dates).

FYI, I have already booked meetings as mentioned below:




Thank you.

Regards,
Nicola
