To All

As we near completion of the master review for required collateral provisions 
for counterparts to trade OnLine, please find attached a consolidated list of 
exceptions.  This list highlights those counterparts where EOL should utilize 
GTCs with collateral in lieu of executed masters.  Summary findings are as 
follows:

1) Gas - reject master and use GTC w/collateral for 20 clients

2) Power - Reject 2 counterparts from trading OnLine

3) Financial - No exceptions

4) Canada - TBD

5) London - No exceptions

Thanks to everyone who assisted with this important review of credit 
provisions.   Please feel free to forward this note as necessary or contact 
me for any questions.
