Sorry I can't wish you well in person but I have a severe case of 
laryngitis!. Fortunately, I'm on antibiotics but the doctor said "Don't speak 
for 3 days.  I wish my wife would get laryngitis."  Maybe the desert air in 
Arizona would bring relief.  I love saguros (is that right?)  Daddy thought 
planning for Chanukah was a great idea.  Also, tell Daddy that if he used 
e-mail I could talk to him even when I have laryngitis.  Love, Sas
