To the trading lawyers working on counterparty lists:

Per the email below from Louise, the current target date for completion of 
counterparty lists appears to be Tuesday, October 12.  As noted below, an 
additional list of approved counterparties should be provided to us tomorrow.

FYI, per my conversations w/Frank Davis, the first simulation occurred this 
week, and an additional simulation is scheduled for next week.

On Friday we will be receiving the remaining customer list from credit, due 
to the timescales I am asking for turnaround on the customer matrix and 
master agreement review by the end of play Tuesday 12th October.

Any problems with this please notify me immediately as we are now running up 
against very tight deadlines in terms of getting all of the information in 
the system for the launch schedule.

Thanks

Louise

Mark,
On another note we are requesting a review of the blanket decision which has 
been made to prevent any regulated utility from completing any financial 
transactions, if we are not prepared to do the due diligence on which ones 
can transact and which ones can not - is this our responsibility or theirs?  
ie their decision whether to trade or not.
Louise
