Per Mark's earlier emails and conversations, we have 10 govt's/utilities with 
masters in place that are approved to trade, with about another 30 currently 
being negotiated.  The other 30 or so will only be approved to trade when we 
get signed masters in place and any other relevant documents related thereto 
(like legal opinions).
