Susan:  The two above-mentioned projects are in the process of being 
unwound.  The only confirm and the Master Swap Agreement for each are being 
TERMINATED.  Will you please continue to follow up with Brenda Funk (in the 
capital mgmt. group with Scott Sefton and Gareth Bahlman) to get copies of 
the "Swap Termination Agreement" for each and then enter the info into Lotus 
Notes.  Thanks.  Sara
