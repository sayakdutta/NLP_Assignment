Under separate cover, I will fax to you a copy of the February 6, 1998 legal 
opinion which, from my research, created the "issue"  between SG&E and Enron 
North America Corp., formerly Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp.  It might 
be easiest if SD&G reissues the opinion without the qualification contained 
in Paragraph 5.  Please let me know what you think.  Regards.  Sara
