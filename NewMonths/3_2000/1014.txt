Sara - I will make copies of the updates to the Japan legal survey and=20
deliver them to you in the morning.  If you already have access to the Enro=

Europe Jurisdictional Library, Alan must be talking about the Jurisdictiona=

database which contains all of the original surveys from 1996 and 1997 that=
=20
you and him worked on.   I recall that you were having computer problems at=

some point and you might have lost the link to the database, but here it is=

Thanks.

Since 1996 ECT Legal has engaged and directed local counsel in certain=20
targeted jurisdictions in the Asia-Pacific, Latin America, Middle East and=
=20
the Caribbean regions for the purpose of conducting a survey of (and=20
compiling survey results for) a range of legal/regulatory and tax issues. =
=20
These issues were those relevant to ECT=01,s potential business activities =
as=20
identified by the business groups for the regions prior to conducting the=
=20
survey.

These surveys have been primarily utilized by the Emerging Markets, Financi=
al=20
and Physical Trading Legal Groups and hard copies are kept in the Houston,=
=20
Singapore and London offices.  However, we are happy to report that "soft=
=20
copies" of these surveys are now available "on-line" to ECT Legal.  We have=
=20
developed a Jurisdictional Document Library Database with "read-only" acces=
s=20
for all users.   By way of background, ECT Legal prepared these summaries=
=20
based on extensive written legal opinions issued to ECT Legal by each local=
=20
law firm in response to ECT Legal=01,s memorandum presenting the survey iss=
ues=20
to be answered.  The ECT Tax Department assisted with identifying and=20
reviewing the tax issues covered in the surveys.   The surveys include 15=

Asia-Pacific countries, 1 Middle East country, 13 Latin American and=20
Caribbean countries. =20
