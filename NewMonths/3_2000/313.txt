Part I:  Dress Code for Female FERC Lawyers at FERC Proceedings*

Skirts must be mid-calf length and of a synthetic fabric.
All clothing worn in FERC hearing rooms must be properly aged (12 years or 
more).
No solid-colored garments are permitted.  Exceptions:  mauve, pink, peach, 
teal, harvest gold.
Hair must be fuzzy, multi-colored and must partially conceal the face.
Suntan hose must be worn at all times.  
Open-toed shoes (preferably in a lighter color than the hem of the skirt) are 
preferred.
Those with a flair for fashion are permitted to wear inexpensive animal print 
garments, metallic accessories or clothing with fake fur trim, so as to 
attract attention to one's originality.
