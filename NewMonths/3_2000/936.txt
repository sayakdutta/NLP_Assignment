This looks good to me so I will go ahead and approve it unless you have an 
objection.

I have created the following new Product Type in the Data Manager:

US East Power Phy Firm ICAP

Please go into the DataManager and indicate your approval. If you have any 
questions concerning the Product Type, please DO NOT REJECT it, rather call 
me instead.

I have attached a full description of the Product that will be built under 
this Product Type for your review.
