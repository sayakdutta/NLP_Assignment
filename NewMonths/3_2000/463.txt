Hi Katie,  I am feeling good about status of the deals!  Looks like we should 
close next Wednesday.  So as it stands now, I don't think I will have to work 
this weekend.  Of course now that I just said that, it almost positive that 
something will come up.

Hmmm,  Actually work might not be such a bad thing as my alternative is 
helping my roommate pack his stuff up for his move to North Carolina.

Have a great weekend! Talk to you soon.

Gerald
