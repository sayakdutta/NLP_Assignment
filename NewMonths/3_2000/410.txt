Do I need to bring a pen and paper?  Is that considered "professional"?  I 
think it would be more impressive if you were taking my notes.  Let me know 
what you think.

REMINDER:

Tuesday, March 7th there will be an ENA Gas Assets Meeting with Cliff Baxter 
and Greg Whalley from 2:00 - 3:00 pm in Conference Room EB5C2.

Everyone who supports the ENA Gas Assets business is encouraged to attend, 
this includes each Manager and your groups.  Understanably, you may need some 
people covering desks and phones who won't get to attend.  For those who will 
be able to make it, keep in mind we would like to leave everyone with a 
professional image of our groups.  Please encourage your groups to be there
