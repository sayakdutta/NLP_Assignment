Ms. Grobmyer -

I have forwarded your message to Bill Donovan at Enron.  If there is any 
interest, I'm sure he will contact you.

Dear Mr. Lay:
?
I am writing to follow up on a letter and  information that I sent you last 
week.? We are an art advising firm here in  Houston,and I was hoping to speak 
with you regarding artwork for your new  building.? Will you be purchasing 
art for the building?
?
If so, my company can certainly help.? Please  let me know if you have any 
interest in our services.? Thank  you!
?
Best Regards,
?
