Stinson,

What is SPAV? Is it the basket option model?

Vince and Stinson,

I checked the file and the maintenance that automatically renews on 4/1/2000  
is for the following products:


SPAV
SWING

I will go ahead and contact FEA and see about getting the renewal invoice for 
these.  I'll send it to Shirley for payment once I have it.



while.  FEA told us a couple of years ago I believe that they do not have 
maintenance available for these products any longer.  So, you don't need to 



through 10/20/2000.

If you have any questions, please let me know.  Otherwise, I will proceed 

licenses.

Thanks,
Karla
