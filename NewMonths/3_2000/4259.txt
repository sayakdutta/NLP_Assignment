Below is proposed schedule for the Darden case video-taped interviews; an 
hour has been scheduled for each of you (except Vince, for whom 1-1/2 hours 
has been requested), however, you may be finished in less time.  The location 
is yet to be determined, but will most likely take place in a vacant office 
of 50M.  

Please let me know of any conflicts with this proposed schedule.  I'll send 
along additional information as it becomes available.  Thank you and have a 
nice weekend.  SRS
