David,  Attached is a short term sheet agreement that I propose we put into 
place for the Gallup electric driver which EECC is installing for Enron 
Compression Services Company.  As I understand it now, we have only an AFE 
with signature for this deal in place.   As I indicated on my voice mail, I 
need something more substantial in place for assignment, since we are selling 
a portion of this project off to investors.  Please review and lets discuss.  
Timing unfortunately is not long as usual.  I would like to meet as soons as 
your schedule allows.  Thanks.
