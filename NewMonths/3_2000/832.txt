Remember those previous discussions about relaxation?  You know me well 
enough to know that I am not easily offended, and in fact have thoroughly 
enjoyed the preceding banter.  Still, I do appreciate your remembering that I 
am a lady. (I have a bad habit of forgetting.)  





Sorry, I'm just giving you a hard time. Please let me know if my behavior was 
inappropriate.
