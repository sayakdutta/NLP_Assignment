Dear Richard and Michelle:

Attached to this e-mail is a copy of my resume and a cover letter that I have
forwarded to Ms. Nedre Strambler with Enron's Human Resources department in
an attempt to find a Legal Assistant position there at Enron.  As you know I
was
Carrin Patman's paralegal for several years over at Bracewell & Patterson and
I
am hoping that I might be able to use the two of you as references should I
be contacted regarding the positions I've applied for.

Richard, in the Beeson matter I see that the Supreme Court rendered a
decision in Intratex's favor regarding the necessity of a new trial if
the Plaintiffs attempt to recertify the class. As I assume you are aware, I
was the person in charge of assembling and organizing all 1200 boxes of
documents relating to the various Intratex, HPL, Atapco, Beeson and Mills
matters and assisted Carrin and Neal Manne in many of the court appearances.
I believe that this experience can be very useful if I were to work for Enron.

Michelle, even though I only had an opportunity to work on a couple of your
projects while you were at B&P, I did have an opportunity to assist you and
others at Enron with the urgent project to produce employment records to the
FTC last fall. I really enjoyed working with you and would like to do so
again.

Any assistance you can offer in this matter would be greatly appreciated.
