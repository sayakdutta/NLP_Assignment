.

Please let me know what you think.

Thanks,

Edmund,

How about this?

Please forward to me a copy of whatever you would like to send before you=

send it.

Thanks,

Further to the recent queries you raised concerning the ETA, we can provide=
=20
you with the following comfort.  The final sentence of
 clause 2(d) prevents a Counterparty from claiming that the ETA has not bee=
n=20
duly accepted or an offer has not been validly made
 or that a transaction has not been validly entered into solely by virtue o=
f=20
the electronic =01&click=018 method of submitting offers or execution.=20

This same principle provides protection to you in that the only binding=20
transactions upon both yourselves and Enron are the ones in
 which certain terms have been clicked upon by you and the same terms=20
accepted by Enron through the automated EnronOnline process.
 The system is designed to ensure that BOTH PARTIES ARE BOUND BY the terms =
of=20
the offer you submit are the only terms=20
which ARE can be accepted by Enron. As a result, there have been no instanc=
es=20
in which a customer offered on one set of terms, but Enron
 accepted a different set of terms.
