Sheri, you need to get the RC Owner to whom she reports to approve this (via 
e-mail) before I can order it.   Thanks.

We would like to request an upgrade from 48 to 98 megs of RAM for Leslie 
Hansen's computer as soon as possible:

Co. #413, RC #1157
EB 3847 (Ext. 3-6121)
PC Serial #961190  (Laptop scheduled to be moved from EB 3890 to EB 3847)

Since Leslie will be working from home during part of March, a move request 
has been made to replace Leslie's current equipment with the lap top located 
at EB3890.  The upgrade needs to be made to the lap top so she can run Live 
Link, and other necessary applications.  

Please let me know if you need any additional information.  Thank you!
