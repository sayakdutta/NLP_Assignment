Hi Felix!  I return from Argentina this weekend.  I am having some problems 
with the laptop which I'll need you to adjust upon my return. I am traveling 
with an ESA person from Houston who has a laptop and never experiences any of 
the daily problems which I have.  The problems are:

1.  Immediately upon logging in each day, I receive the following message:  
"This install. will install CITRIX ICA Client  - YES or NO"

2.  "Unable to load workspace file destop.dsk.  File is in use by another 
program.  Delete the file and create a new workspace?"

Also, the screen freezes frequently and I'm not sure what this is related 
to.  I can't use the laptop offline to even get into word.  
When can we review these problems?  Thanks.  Sara
