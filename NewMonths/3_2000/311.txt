See especially pages 5 & 6 of the attached doc., which include the argument 
that existing ROFR should not be grandfathered.  Please send any comments you 
have to me.  Thanks!!

Thank you for all the comments.  Here is a last draft of our GPG rehearing 
comments.  Please forward any additional comments no later than noon, Friday 
March 10.

Significant changes from the last draft are as follows:
1.  We are asking the Commission to eliminate the peak/off-peak cost & 
revenue study, rather than clarify that the study applies only to excess 
revenues. (p.2)
2. References to the TW Global Settlement have been removed. The reference to 
existing settlements is more generic and included only to preserve our 
rights. (p.4)
3. A new argument on ROFR has been added.  We are asking the Commission to 
immediately apply the new policy that ROFR does not apply to discount rate 
agreements. (p.5-6)
4.Several reporting arguments have been deleted -- masking shipper names, 
clarifying that only senior employee names have to be posted and clarifying 
the Sept. 1 reporting date.  With respect to these last two arguments, we 
have decided that we can interpret it our way without further clarification.
5.New clarification concerning the date for which the lifting of the price 
caps on capacity release is to be implemented.
