Dear Interested Parties:

Please find attached the final draft of NARUC's National Electricity Policy. We are providing you with this document as a courtesy. Our goal is to
review and debate the policy at the NARUC Annual Meeting in Philadelphia and to approve a policy that provides members of Congress and other federal policy makers a summary of NARUC's position on federal energy policy and legislation. We look forward to a lively debate in Philadelphia.

Sincerely,
Judy Jones, Co-chair
Edward Garvey, Co-chair
NARUC's National Energy Policy Committee
