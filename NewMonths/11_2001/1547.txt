Let's get on  it really seriously tomorrow.  We should have at least started AEP's notice period with your note today.

Did we send margin letters on others today as we need to.

Non payments for ENA only.  More to follow.  We should seriously consider some default notices.

Bill - call with any questions.  I will update you tomorrow as we continue to contact the non-pays.  Leslie
