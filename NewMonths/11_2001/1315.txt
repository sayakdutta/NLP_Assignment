We have reserved room EB 4746 from 3:15-4 pm today to discuss status on the SoCal margin agreement.  SoCal is still holding to the deadline of tomorrow; this morning I asked for a couple of additional days while we work through the details but they have not yet agreed to an extension.

We need to cover, at a minimum -
1) suggested wording changes to the agreement 2) sign off on operational coordination between EES and ENA 3) agreement from Credit to the change  4) understanding of final internal signoffs necessary
