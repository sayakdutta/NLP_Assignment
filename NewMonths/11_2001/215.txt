I agree with your invitation list.  This is Deb's closest circle of friends and she would not want it to be any bigger.  I'm glad you included Maggie and Nora becasue I was thinking about them today as well.

O.K.....I talked to both Steve and Melissa; Melissa talked to Deborah Ortman (she cannot make it); I received an Email from Maria (she'll very likely NOT make it);  I found out Sherrie is at Cynergy in Cincinnati, so I'll give that one more try.

So, the "final" list for Friday is:

Deb and Bill
Melissa and Steve
Janie and husband (so sorry I cannot remember his name, Janie)
Neal
Nora and Maggie
Christie and Ed.

Bill, do you want to call Vallones and change the count to "11"?  Let me know if you want me to do it.

By the way, Melissa completely agrees that the group we have coming, along with those invited but unable to attend, is THE list Deb would want included, so no need to expand the invitation list. Janie, agree?

I'll let you know if I reach Sherrie.

Best!

Hi!!   I left 2 messages for Deborah Ortman and her husband Ed Scott, but no word yet.  I think I have her eMail at my house--I'll get it during lunch and try her that way.     I have not heard from Maria, but I'm sure I will today.  Leslie wrote she's unlikely to be able to pull it together to be here. I have not been able to find a number for Sherrie Rutherford but am still trying.  Right now, it looks like:

	Deb and Bill
	Steve and Melissa
	Janie and husband
	Neil (no guest)
	Christie and Ed.

I think the original list of guests is her list of closest friends that she would enjoy sharing the night with.  This may sound odd, but I think she would really enjoy having the Maggie and Nora, Steve and Melissa's girls there--they are very very close and spend much weeekend time together..and they are a little older (13 and 14 i think)--I just mentioned it to Steve and he a said that would be great--I'll call Melissa.

Other than her family, (and though maybe a nice thought, may be too much of a surprise for her, and pretty extreme for us to pull together at the last minute), I think, with the addition of the girls, it will be a wonderful group of 11...and likely those who cannot attend will send a note or call, so evryone she'd want there, will be there, in one way or another.

I think a photographer would be great, for maybe an hour or so.

What do you and Janie think?

..Christie.



 


janie  called this am---Julia and Dave can't make it--Neal wanted to knw the guy  attttire---i'm wearing blazer and tie--kind of fits Vallone's i think---did you  hear from the CA people?  janie doesn't think Rock will come----should we  expand the invitee list ??  i just don't know many of her pals ??  do  you think we need a photographer or is that overkill ??/   respectfully---
