Ask everyone to send you the info to fill in the blanks (and to copy the others on the list).  Perhaps you could join in on Oxley's 6:00 call...I'll ask by copy of this message.





Will do.  How do you want to go about collecting comments?  Best thing might
be to have everyone review it and then get around the table to go over it
and hash out any issues.  




See minor comment and then circulate to the larger group.

Here is a first cut at a script.  Please call me with any comments
and/or
let me know if you want us to circulate this to the broader working
group.

Thanks
