Contr acts And Agreements Be submitted in A.98-07-003 et al.


See attached.  Crazy Commissioner (Carl Wood) at the PUC is now trying to require folks to submit their DA contracts to the PUC (everyone refused the first time he "asked").  Customers are going to get very cranky about this.  Likely to be a pretty pitched battle.  I'm contacting the large customers to see what they intend to do.  Can't see them going down without a fight. We should plan on discussing with Mike Day first thing on Wednesday morning, if folks are available. Please forward to anyone else who needs it.
Best,
Jeff
