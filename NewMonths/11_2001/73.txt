Thanks. My battery cap looked a little different. I will try to take it off tonight and will take a picture.
It wasn't obvious to me at the time how the cap worked (it wasn't nearly as clean around the
battery as grandmas). Hopefully no more problems.

Jay,
Here's 3 pictures as I see Grandma's car.
One with the hot battery terminal cap on.
One with the hot battery terminal cap off.
One showing where the hot cable from your battery connects to your starter.
Hope they help.
Love Dad
PS: Let me know if you get these.  I made the files as small as possible,
but don't know if they are too big to get to you.
