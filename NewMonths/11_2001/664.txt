chris,

Here is what is going on with Citizens right now:

1)  Mike Grigsby and Randy Gay are reviewing the revisions to the Griffith contract from their perspective.  I will have Patti review it once they are done.  I looked at your peaking language and was not able to enhance it.  However, does the new calculation address any unanticipated pipeline rate changes such that the demand margin or sales margin could be negetive?
2)  interuptible gas will flow right now to Nogales from the Waha pool, according to Pattie
3)  I am attaching a summary of the conference call we had on the 18th and would like your input before sending it out.
4) the capacity release was posted and matched successfully.

Let me know ifyou have any questions.

thanks,

Kim
