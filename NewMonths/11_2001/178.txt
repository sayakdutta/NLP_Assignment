I'd still like to play tennis sometime.  I don't have the time nor the money to play much golf.

Speaking of golf and your predictions, would you like to wager on your goal of 70's by Dec '02.  I'll bet you right now at $10 a stroke over/under 80 on a reasonable course (par 72 etc)  of your choice in Houston next December.   :-)

Hi Charlie,

I got your message yesterday.  I'm very sorry to hear about your
grandfather.

Sure, I'd be glad to play tennis sometime.  However, I'd rather practice
golf.  With all the computer work I've been doing, I really started to
miss doing something competitive.  So, rather than tennis, I'm focusing
on a new challenge, and I decided to get good at golf.

I know you'll laugh at all this, but I'm approaching it the same way I
did tennis and baseball.  I'm watching and practicing.  I've been
working at it for about a month.  Unlike a couple of years ago when I
would just go out and play, I'm focusing on learning the stroke and
getting good.  In the past month, I've gone from high 90s to high 80s.
When I consistently get in the mid 80s, I'll get a good set of clubs and
then keep going.  My goal (which I'll reach) is to shoot in the 70s by
December 2002.  If you care to bet, I'll gladly take you up on it. :)

It's so cool, because in the last week, it finally clicked on how the
wrist snap is similar to tennis, and that made all the difference in the
world.  Now, I can practice a good swing instead of a swing that
happened to yield decent results from time to time.

Anyway, it's great to get outside and focus on something competitive
again.  We have some relatives coming in this weekend, so it looks like
we'll be heading up your way on Saturday.  I'm actually going to be
flying to Victoria and back with my brother-in-law's uncle just for fun
on Saturday afternoon.  I think you said that you won't be in town, but
if you are, let me know.

See ya,

Bobby
