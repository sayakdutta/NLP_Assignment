Frank,

I am working with Panda Resources to potentially supply gas to a couple of their Arizona facilities.  However, they say they have a plant coming online March 1st in El dorado, Ark.  They looking for TX Gas for Mar - jun and Tn zone 0 starting July 1.  She has gone over the structures that she is looking for.  Is there someone in your group that would be interested in working on this potential gas supply with them?  Let me know.

Thanks,

Kim
