I tried to call you last week but you were with a customer.  At this point I have sold my Maxima but with the current Enron environment and poor stock market, I'll continue waiting to purchase any new vehicle at this point.  It may be after the first of the year before I do anything.




Kevin,

Just checking in and seeing if you have sold your Maxima.  If you are still
interested in a Toyota Tundra let me know how I can help.
