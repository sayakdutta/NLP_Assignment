 
  Thanks for our email.  At the present time, Ena is not putting new GISBs in place.  However, we have a Enfolio Spot Agreement which will achieve the same purpose.  Please see attached.

   

 

Debra,

It was a pleasure speaking with you yesterday regarding the GISB
contract.
I look forward to receipt of your suggested language for the netting and
dispute resolution provisions, and your decision on the acceptability of
our Sections 10.3, 10.4, and 15 (Confidentiality).

Please do not hesitate to call if we need to discuss this further.
Unless you instruct otherwise, we intend to sign the Base Contract
first, and then FedEx partially executed originals to you for signature.

Thanks,
--Anthony
