it feels like life at work here is still day to day, we are still having credit issues in buying our gas back, it is difficult to be away for so long,  I don't want to let you down and I feel like a complete heel, but I am terrified

 

thank you sweetie.  you really are a man who has everything.  The Canadian
Life check is here today.  So no worries.

Have you decided for sure whether you are going to TX or not?  Need to know
re:  basement scheduling.  No pressure but sure am glad you decided to come.
:-)

love you, jess
