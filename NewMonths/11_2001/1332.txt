Ok to travel.

Jim
 

I assume this is ok, let me know otherwise.

 

I think they are closed in the afternoon.

On a different topic, I need to travel to Wash., D.C. on the evening of Nov. 28 and return the evening of the 29th, for a FERC meeting.  Go ahead and see what's available; I assume the expenditure is OK, but you might double check with Jim.  It's for a matter that is important to the Services group, and they've asked me to attend.

 

Tried calling, no answer.

 

Line was so long this a.m., I did not get my shot because I had to leave for a meeting.  Can you check to see whether they have any vaccine left?

 


	Did yall get your shot?  Line was short when I went to Credit Union at lunch......FYI
