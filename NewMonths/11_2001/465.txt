I went to this party with my friend Brad Fagan - we ended up at this loud bar and ran into P. - It wasn't much fun.  
 

me too! we need to do something about that?  who did you go with on saturday and where did you go drinking?

 

came back from dallas friday - just went to houstons with a friend.  Saturday, worked on the house and ran some errands.  Went out saturday night and drank too much - just hung out yesterday.  Nothing at all exciting!  I am very boring these days!

 

excellent!
My turkey day was nice - saw my niece that i haven't seen in 10 years - had about 18 people at my parents, so it was a mad house!

Didn't do alot, did some shopping, set up my new computer, went to dinner, cleaned the house....how about you?

 

I found it!  It was in a box in my garage.  Thanksgiving was just ok - have had better.  how was yours and what did you do this weekend?

 

just wanted to remind you to start looking for your c-card now!  don't know if you want to scuba or not, but nice to 
have options.

Hope you had a nice thanksgiving - we need to go for drinks soon!
