Megan,

Are we going to owe Pasadena money for every invoice?  If not, since we owe them so much on this one, is there a way we can offset with future invoices where they owe us money?  Can we check into that?

Let me know - 

Kim

I have taken over your account from Janine Cashin and am working on the invoices for April forward.  As I complete them, I will send them to you for settlement.  The April 2001 Calc sheet and Invoice are attached.  Enron plans to wire the City of Pasadena $1,853,770.40 on Friday, 11/30/01.  Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
