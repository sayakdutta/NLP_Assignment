	Sue, I think it would be very good to invite the people below.  We may want to talk about a
	modified version in the future for the rest of the teams.  The only other person we might
	invite is Mike Bodnar just because I have him as the point person with Chris on the third
	party storage.  If possible I definitely want to attend.  Thanks. Lynn

 

Lynn,

I am presenting Storage 101 training class on Wednesday November 7th from 2-3:30 p.m.  I am trying to keep the group at a manageable size so am just inviting marketing.  However, I wanted to know if you thought it would be a good idea to invite you, Steve J., Gary S. Darrell, John B. and Terry K. and Chris Greely (as she schedules 3rd party storage for us)?  I can't invite all of market services at this time.  I'm not sure if I want to give it to all of market  services even at a later date due to the confidential nature of the information.  What do you think?

Sue
