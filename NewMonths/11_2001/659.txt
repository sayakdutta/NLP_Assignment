Anne,

Please book the following accrual origination from grigsby's book to myself and Chris Foster ( 50% each):

June 2001	$9,566.58
July 2001	$5,706.52

Also, are you the one that I need to inform of what to pay John Cogan?  And if so, what months and amounts have we paid him?

I will have september ready today or tomarrow and October ready by the 10th which will be our standard procedure.  Let me know if you have any questions.

thanks,

Kim
