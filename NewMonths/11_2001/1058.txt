I'm fine with it.   They will only see through Cal 03 though.

 

Hi Kevin,

Do you care for the Virginia State Corporation Commision to have access to EnronOnline prices as a basis for establishing a forward market price within tariffs. Thanks.

Let's discuss.

 

FYI, Gregg Cooper is with wholesale EES.

thanks, Kathy

 

Last July, the VA SCC submitted an application to view EOL.  They were declined by credit as they had no intention to trade.

It is Virginia's hope to use EOL as a price basis when establishing the forward market price within tariffs for utilities and other suppliers to a new emerging deregulated market.

I'm asking that this application be re-reviewed and that they be given read only access.  Three years would be most helpful as they'll be conducting this program to set pricing through 2004, possibly cal05.

Thank you,


Gregg
