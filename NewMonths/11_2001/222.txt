We have a deal with Gwwon this month-November.  Baseload sale at Needles for 10000/d.  Deal No.  1135697.


 

Janie, 

Can you send me an email (just something short) with the deal numbers of any future trades you make with Gwoon Tom?  Unfortunately, when you put a note in Sitara's special handling instructions, I don't get any kind of notification.  As long as I know the deals ahead of time, I can make sure they appear on separate invoices.  They also go to different internal mail locations and contacts so I have to correct that as well.

Thanks
