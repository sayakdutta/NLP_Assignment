Below is written by our environmental consultant EEA

Based on the preliminary emissions data for 2001 just 
released, the allowance surplus for this year is 23,189 tons 
bringing the total bank at the end of the year to 83,778 tons.  This 
would mean a flow control value of 0.26 or a discount factor of 0.63 
for 2002.  The exact flow control/discount values cannot be 
calculated right now because they will depend on how many 
banked allowances are used for compliance this year and also on 
the implementation of the Maryland consent decree which the state 
and EPA probably wont figure out until next year.  But we are 
pretty much in that range.
