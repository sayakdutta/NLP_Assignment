	Should we be talking about make up when we are allocating Belleville?  I had a question from Alliant,
	"You, NNG and ANR both have room to deliver gas to ANR, even though you are doing an allocation,
	why can't you schedule more delivery at ANR?  Wouldn't that help the system?"  I think it would be
	hard to explain that we are doing make up, allocating and NOT letting a shipper increase deliveries all
	at the same time.  What do you guys think?  Thanks. Lynn

   With low pressure at LS Power, Gas Control resquested ANR stay on rate at Janesville.  We will try to do make-up tomorrow, Nov. 14.

ANR will try to pull an additional 10,000 for today, 11-13-01 at Janesville POI-180.  They are short about 40,000 on their OBA for current month.
