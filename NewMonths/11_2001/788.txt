According to our records we did not receive an executed agreement or confirm, so I am sending those out today via Federal Express w/ Fed X return to me.

Did you ever receive a signed copy back from Dick Forrest from last November?
If so, no need to send out a new contract.  Just send a copy to Dick Forrest.
This came about when Dick Forrest called me last week stating that he could not find a copy of our contract, that's why I had Terry request another copy be sent.

 


 Attached is a contract and confrimations  for the above previously sent in November of 2000 along with confirmation for referenced trade.  I will send the aforementioned again to Mr. Forrest.
