I wanted to let you know that we will be discussing the MPS agreements and scheduling process with Lynn Blair and Gerry Medeles today at 3:00 PM in room 648. We will be addressing the reporting and analysis issues that these agreements are causing.

You're welcome to attend.

Don - I am planning to call Lynn in her office.
