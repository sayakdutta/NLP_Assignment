I f there is nothing new to discuss we can cancel but I would like to know what is on the Commisssion's Agenda for next when you get it.  Thanks.  Also, the next time Leslies come to town, maybe we can all go to lunch.

 

Janie - are you planning to have the West Desk Regulatory Meeting tomorrow at 2:30?  I don't have anything of substance to talk about, unless FERC puts the El Paso proceedings on the agenda for next week.
