A ok for me

 


Could you kindly provide me with your revisions, if any, as soon as possible.

Thanks, Nella
 

Gentlemen, you have recently received hard copies of the 3rd quarter soft targets.  Attached for your reference are the electronic versions of the soft targets.

Paul, your hard copies will arrive on Monday.

Regards, Nella
