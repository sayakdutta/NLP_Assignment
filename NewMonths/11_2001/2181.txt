$18.10/share.  don't make me give suggestions.

 

o.k PG&E.  

 

You're kidding, right?  Edison's at about 14.50.

 

By the end of the week, our share price may be lower than Edison's.  

 

Wow, based on the share price, it appears they're having significant difficulty finding additional sources of funds.  Ain't getting any prettier.
