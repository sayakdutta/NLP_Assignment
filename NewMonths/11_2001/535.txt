A few things. 
 
	- Mainly next week this floor will not be in high spirits.  The layoffs will be next week.  EGM and EIM will be hit  	  hard 
	- John asked about bonuses (also, mentioned he had 3 job offers).  George said should have an idea within a few weeks 
	- etc. 





And what did george have to say?

He is looking at it right now.  Oh, by the way, we had a group meeting this morning with George.




Don't try Mike T, get it done.

I go over the b-plan everyday of my life.  I will try to get John to go through 50+ pages and the preso.




Mike, 
I need you and John to go over the bplan and preso today. 
Thanks.
