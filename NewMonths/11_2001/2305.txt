Yes, I will keep you all posted.  I placed a call to the customer at 7:30 this morning, but have not heard back from them yet.

Thanks, Lamar.  Geoff, could you let us know how it goes with the customer and if this a mix-up on the customer's end.  Thanks very much.

Best,
Jeff

Geoff Pollard is the SM for Pac Tel.






Lamar -- who is the client rep for Pac Tel?  Can they get into Pac Tel and try and find out if we have done something inappropriate?  We need to call this guy back by Monday EOB.  Please let Jeff Dasovich know so he can call Joyce back - I'll be out on vacation next week.
