Kevin,

Please, talk to Jeff Shankman's secretary about including all the Research 
Group members on
the 31st floor  in the company provided lunches (when they are available).

If an additional  lunch is needed from time to time, it's fine, but it should 
be seen as a something done
under exceptional circumstances.

Hi Vince ,
It has been brought to my attention that several
members of the Weather Team may require a
lunch from time to time.
The person right now is Trisha Tlapek she
has to be at her desk .
Please , could  I provide  daily lunches for her.


                                             Thanks
                                         Kevin Moore
