1.  The Enron company is "ENA"
   2.  How many Calculation Periods will there be?  December is a short month 
if the Transaction begins on 12/25/99.  Will the first payment be due  in 
early January?  If you intend three (3) payments to be made, then the Calc. 
Periods are from 12/25-12/31, January, 2/1-2/22.
   3.  Is this a 24-hour index or is it limited to peak hours as defined by 
CAMMESA? 

I left a message for Joe Hunter (confirmation desk - Ext. 33316) to be 
prepared for this Transaction.

Brent:  would you please verify the Floating Price?

Thanks.
