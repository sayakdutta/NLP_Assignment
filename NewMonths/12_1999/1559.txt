Could you see if the retail people could use this worksheet format? We may 
not be able to do this for everything but I believe we could use this format 
for Tennessee, CNG, Tennessee, Tetco and Texas Gas (excluding AGL).  What do 
you think?

Here is a more updated volume breakdown.   We swing down on weekends (and
sometimes during the week if the customers shut down).   These volumes are 
good
except for Boston Gas and S. Ct.   We are waiting for the ldc demand curves 
and
Algorithms.   Those two ldc volumes represent our estimates.


Please let me know when you have a contract number.   Thanks.
