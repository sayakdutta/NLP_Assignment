I was successful shopping for Jim on-line at B&N and Territory Ahead.  Mum, 
only the book will be shipped to your house; I was on autopilot and typed in 
my work address for the other.  (Really missed the boat on tennis clothes.  
You have to act early.  Today I saw one of the Met pros leaving with his 
catalog to order FALL 2000 Nike stuff!)  Karin, I am probably going to make a 
stop at Macy's or Neiman's makeup counter at some point so I could pick up 
the Estee Lauder for MeeMaw* if you know the shade.  

Bill's b-day is today; if you want to send a message his e-mail is 


That's all this elf knows.
