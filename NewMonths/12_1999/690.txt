Index:  Gas Daily WAHA
Abbreviation: Waha
Sort Code: 3530


The Index for a calendar day shall be the average of the Daily Midpoint 
prices published for such calendar day under the heading "Daily Price Survey" 
in the Permian Basin Area: Tex intras, Waha area section of Gas Daily, or if 
a calendar day is not a Business Day then the price for such calendar day 
will be the average of the Common High and Common Low prices published on the 
next succeeding Business Day.

Should the word "area" after "Waha" be capitalized? It's not capitalized in 
the Gas Daily publication - so to consistent with the publication I did not 
capitalize.
On some Gas Daily products we are switching to the Gas Daily posted average - 
is this one of those?  Bob Bowen has been looking into this also. See above.
