Dear Vince,

Do you think you would be able to confirm a talk title and bullet points for 
your 'new research' talk by the end of the first week of January?  In terms 
of the panel discussion we will confirm the actual content and structure 
closer to the date of the conference - in the meantime, if you have any ideas 
as to how we can make the panel as discussive as possible that would be great.

Best regards,
Oliver


    

        



    Oliver,

    I can cover both presentations.

    Dear Vince,

    Thank you for agreeing to take part in our annual US congress.
    There were 2 things that I would ideally like you to be involved in.  The 
first
    would be to present any new research you may have.  This would be part of 
stream
    3 (see attached) which looks at new research in derivatives modelling and
    analysis.  If you would like to present any new research that fits into 
the
    rough areas outlined that would be great.
    The second would be part of a panel discussion on weather derivatives 
(number 44
    attached).  I have also invited Jeff Porter (Koch) and Ravi Nathan 
(Aquila).
    Please let me know if you would like to present any new research and/or 
take
    part in the panel.

    i look forward to hearing from you soon.

    Best regards,
    Oliver
