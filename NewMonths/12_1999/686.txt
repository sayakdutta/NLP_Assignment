Index:  Gas Daily WAHA
Abbreviation: Waha
Sort Code: 3530


The Index for a calendar day shall be the average of the Common High and 
Common Low prices published for such calendar day under the heading "Daily 
Price Survey" in the Permian Basin Area: Tex intras, Waha area section of Gas 
Daily, or if a calendar day is not a Business Day then the price for such 
calendar day will be the average of the Common High and Common Low prices 
published on the next succeeding Business Day.

Should the word "area" after "Waha" be capitalized?
On some Gas Daily products we are switching to the Gas Daily posted average - 
is this one of those?  Bob Bowen has been looking into this also.
