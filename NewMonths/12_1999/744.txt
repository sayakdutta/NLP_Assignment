Yes, the deal is currently being negotiated (by Rodney).  I haven't heard any 
details.  It was originally planned to close after X-mas but maybe it will 
happen in the next few days.  FYI - I'll be out of the office after X-mas 
until next year.  SS

Is this the most recent copy of the Merrill Lynch confirmation?
Thanks, David
