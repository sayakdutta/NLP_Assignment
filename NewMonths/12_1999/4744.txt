Todd,

Thanks for the invitation to speak on the panel. It was a real pleasure
to join you and other leading professionals in the energy area in the 
discussion
on the state of the electricity markets in the US.

I want to wish you a very Happy and Successful New Year.

Vince Kaminski









Vince --

Thanks for participating in the INFOCAST volatility conference in Houston 10
days ago. Your penetrating analysis of the current state of electricity
markets, and what the trends may be, was a very useful contribution to the
conference.

Happy holidays, and wishing you a healthy and prosperous new year / century
/ millenium.
