Marie,
I have been talking with Sara concerning Deseret and she indicated that I 
should contact you if I need short term follow-up on this agreement.  
Currently, Phil Tice and David Taylor are in final discussions concerning 
certain language within the Annex of this agreement.  Pending resolution of 
these issues, I will need to have the confirmation letter to this agreement 
modified prior to sending to Deseret.  The current language references a 
price of $33.75 per MWh.  This should be replaced with $34.00 in every case.

Please let me know if you have questions.  When Phil and David have come to 
final agreement, we will need to e-mail a final copy of the agreement to 
Deseret for initial signiture.  We can then follow-up with a Fed Ex copy for 
signitures?  Let me know if this is the normal procedure.  We have a deal 
pending that I would like to close today if possible.
