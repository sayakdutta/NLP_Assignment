Hey Melissa,

Sorry I haven't gotten back to you sooner but I have been using up my last 
bit of vacation.  I have been keeping track of the accrual value estimate but 
I want to get some confirmation from the transport and marketing groups on 
how we want to account for it.  I'll let you know soon.

Eric, 

Please let me know how the Accrual Value estimate is coming. 

Thank you, 
Melissa

Eric, 

With the new Wellhead Portfolio, will Greg's Accrual income be readily 
identifiable?

He is looking to have adjustments made to credit him accrual income for both 
the 3rd and 4th Quarters.  Will you be able to back into these numbers using 
this portfolio? 

If you have an estimate number of what the accrual value would be, just let 
me know, and I can pass that along to Greg. 

Thanks,
Melissa
