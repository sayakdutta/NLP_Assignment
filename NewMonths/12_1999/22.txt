FYI.  These are the items I left Ken a voicemail about.

I just received a call from Bob O'Dell (215-569-5312) following up on the 
request from Mayor Edward Rendell regarding the upcoming Millennium 
Philadelphia's Light and Laser Show and Philadelphia 2000.  The Mayor has 
asked Enron for a $750,000 commitment.  As outlined in my December 6th memo 
-- the breakdown of the commitment was for Enron to contribute $500,000 for 
the Millennium Philadelphia's Light and Laser Show on December 31, 1999.  The 
$250,000 would be credited to Philadelphia 2000 Convention package.  The 
Mayor and Mr. Lay have spoken several weeks ago but no commitment was made at 
the time.  Will we be sponsoring the event?

Also, Bob gave us the heads up --- that Governor Tom Ridge (R-PA) will be 
calling Ken Lay this afternoon to ask Mr. Lay to be the chair/co-chair of the 
Republican Governors Association dinner that will be held in Washington, DC 
in February 2000.

Please let me know if you need additional information.

Thank you.
