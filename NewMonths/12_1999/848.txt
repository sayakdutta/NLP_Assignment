The Drafting Committee will meet on Janurary 13 at EEI's offices to develop 
consensus language for products definitions in the Contract.  This would be 
in preparation for a meeting of the entire working group in Houston on either 
Janurary 25 or 26.    We would like to have Reliant, Dynegy, and PECO serve 
on the drafting committee since your companies' have concrete proposals on 
the table.  Several of you have already indicated that you will be available 
for this meeting, will the others please let me know your availability.  
Thanks.

Have a great holiday and a Happy New Year!
