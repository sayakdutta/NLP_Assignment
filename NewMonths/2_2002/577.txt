Mom must be at it again....

career meter:
You find out late this week that your suspicions were right on. You've known for some time that a particular person didn't have your best interests at heart, and this week's revelations confirm your suspicions. It may be time to take flight and move in a different, more fulfilling direction.

love meter:
You feel more sure-footed and in control of your private life by the end of the week, mainly because the uncertainty that has hung over you like shroud finally lifts. It's liberating knowing where you stand.
weekly horoscope:
For February 4-10: A loved one may make a momentous choice, once Saturn and Mercury move direct. This could happen as early as this weekend, but may take longer. The point is that your life, circumstances, and opportunities are finally able to break from free the ice. Welcome change as the liberating thing it truly is. Don't be afraid. For some time, you've known things were not right -- and something had to give. Be very cautious about who you confide in. At this point, the walls have ears. As you establish a new chapter in your life, play your cards very close to your vest.
