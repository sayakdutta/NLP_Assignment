Please leave me a voice mail or email and advise what phone number to call.  Alan Aronowitz (if available), Mark Ellenberg (Cadwalader in New York) and I would like to speak with you about the possibility of immediate assistance which will blend into the Houston process and institutional knowledge.

We are anxious to speak with you before the dial-in conference call.

Please let me know.  Thanks.
