hey lisa,

i looked in my car and couldn't find your dress, so i'm pretty sure you took it inside your parent's house saturday night...where you put it once inside i have absolutely no idea.  good luck tracking it down and thanks again for letting me stay at your folks, i really slept like a log on that bed.
