I had a conversation with Ted Murphy and Mary Nell Browning this morning re: ECTRIC and the London process.

Ted has generated both an in and out -of-the-money list which he will forward so that Houston can review for counterparty termination accuracy.  I think that London can use our newly established processes as a template.  Ted and others will participate in the 9:30 a.m. conference call Feb. 6.

Tom and Bjorn:  Can you provide a Ted with a copy of the "Star Gas Propane, L.P." template, or if this has been replaced, a copy of the most recent template?  Also, the "Liquidation of Price Risk Management Book" template?

Alan:  Can you provide Ted and Mary Nell with a copy of the decision tree and settlement process flowchart?

If the handouts for tomorrow will be ready and incorporate the above, the handouts are all that London will need.

Thanks.  SS
