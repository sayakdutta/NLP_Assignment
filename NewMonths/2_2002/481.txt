I'll gladly bring my photo album and Alina.  Chad has a playdate at a neighbors house.

Gaby told me that she cannot attend.

You mentioned that several people may come to the get together late and that we may visit longer than 12:30 pm.  My sister is arriving in town for a visit around 12PM and a cab is picking her up at the airport.  I currently have arrangements for the cab driver to take her to my house (probably around 1 PM). Let me know if you think I should change this arrangement.   

I can't think of anyone we missed for the party, except Bobby Oldfield.  She is going to start working with us on Children's Church and was a fantastic help with VBS.  I inadvertently dropped her name from the list.  

Thank you for everything you do.  I'm always overwhelmed by your kindness.

Hi Shelley:
I am looking forward to seeing you and Alina tomorrow for the shower.  It 
will be great to have the opportunity to visit with you.
Just so you know, Laura and Kathryn will be here tomorrow and can help 
entertain Alina if needed.
There are several people that I have not heard from as far as RSVP's.  We 
will have plenty of food, so if anyone asks you, please tell them just to 
come!
Take care,
Barbara
P.S.  By the way, if you have any pictures or mementos from your trip that 
you might like to share, bring them along.
