	Margaret,

	I have bought the gas from Mario Silva at Anadarko.  His number is 832-636-7164.  Listed below are the volumes and prices.




	
	Total 						$1,536,174

	I verbally confirmed the wiring information with Mario.  The wire needs to go out on Feb. 27.  I have requested that Mario email me 
	all the pertinent information just to doublecheck.  I will forward you the email when I receive it.  I will do the cash request next.

	Thanks
	Robin
