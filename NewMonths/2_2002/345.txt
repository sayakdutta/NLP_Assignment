that the funds paid into Company 1647, HPLR -- Division of 0058 were swept
into Enron Corp.'s centralized cash accounts.  Given the cumulative size of
these payments, I don't think we should go forward without court apporval.

Also, a financial examiner has just been appointed at ENA to review the
cash management and cash flow between ENA and Corp.  I wouldn't want to
allow this payment to go out right before the examiner gets started.

In addition, are we certain that Exxon doesn't owe ENA or Corp any amounts
due and owing?  If it does, I think that further complicates the analysis.

Brian, if you disagree, let me know; but as it stands, we would need court
approval to return these funds.  Thanks.








Melanie,  same request as prior email....Many thanks, Barbara
