Lindy,

Could you tell me how many of the operating agreements below you have a copy of?  Tiny is trying to complete his files.

Thanks, Kim.

 

Kim, I wasn't waiting on you.  You had provided me with a contact last year I just misplaced my note.  (Feel like we are running a race with the Devil lately and he is gaining ground.. Ha!    It's so busy....)

The Operating Agreements I know that are no longer on file include:  (This is really kind of embarassing as I know these Operating Agreements were on file when I was on the Bloomfield Team.  Someone must have discarded them...)  Anyhow,

Amaco LaPlata
Northwest Pipeline - La Plata
WFS - LaPlata
Red Cedar both La Plata and Ignacio
WFS LaMaquina
WFS Milagro - Blanco Hub
TransColorado - Blanco Hub
Burlington - Blanco Hub
NTUA - San Juan 
Citizens if there have been updates in the last five years. - Flagstaff and Kingman TBS's

I hope this is not to much trouble...   My priority for now lies with Amaco/La Plata... No hurry on any of the others..  Thank you so much



Tiny,

Thank you so much for the reminder, sometimes I think my brain has slipped away.  Do you need all of the San Juan and West of Thoreau contracts?  If you know you have some of them, which ones do you have, I'll send you the rest.

My apologies,

Kim.

 

Kim, last year you provided me with a name/contact in your group that could help me obtain Operating Agreements for customers/interconnects in our area which we curretnly do not have on file.  Unfortunately, I procrastinated with all the happenings towards the end of the year and lost the name..  Could you please send me the name so that I can proceed with the plans of setting up a Regional master file with those agreements.. Thanks
