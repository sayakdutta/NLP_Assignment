thanks for the heads up.  Please mention in Steve's staff meeting on Monday.  

 

No bullets just an FYI for you.

El Paso Field Services called this week to inquire whether TW?Enron would consider selling off any of its assets.  I spoke with Gina Tylor about who to refer this question to and she said Eric's group.  Kevin and I called EPFS back and they are interested specifically in buying the Atoka and Crawford laterals.  While such a sale of assests would have a big impact on TW, it's alittle too early to tell if EPFS is serious.  I'll keep you posted.

 

Bullets, please.
