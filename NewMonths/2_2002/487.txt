Sorry but I don't have an isolated power plant capex number. 

In the NNG commercial folks original budget they forcasted $1.2 M revenue growth from $25 million 2002 Capital.  So my thought is that if you have already included maintenance capital = depreciation, then $25 million capital includes market area expansion as well as power plant growth.

 

One question, on the $1,000,000 margin per additional power plant that we are assuming for growth, is there any capex associated with that growth?  What about any increase in O&M expense?

Thanks,
Jayshree
