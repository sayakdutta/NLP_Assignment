Yes, but we are waiting to hear from Darrell on this one.

 


Is this an official request to amend their contract, or will they send that later?

During the Crawford outage scheduled for 3/5-7, Duke has requested to move its primary receipt point from Crawford to the Duke WT-1 receipt point.  Since there will be no flows from Crawford I think this should work.  The contract # is 27579 with an MDQ of 20,000/d.  Thanks.
