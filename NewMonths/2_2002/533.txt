I just listened to the presentation on the GISB final rule on intraday recalls.

The final rule requires pipelines to support intraday recalls and allow the recalling shipper to nominate at each nomination cycle, but the implementation of the rule will be in two phases:

1. By May 2002, pipelines must file tariff revisions to be effective July 2002 to permit recalls at the evening cycle or for capacity which was not being used by the replacement shipper.

2. With respect to recalls during the flowing gas day, the Commission directs NAESB (GISB) to file comments by October 2002 on how these recalls should be accommodated, with reply comments by October 15.

Commissioner Massey noted that some parties claimed the new rule would undercut reliability.  Staff responded that if a shipper is worried about partial day recallability, then they should buy capacity release packages that are not designated as partial day recallable.  The releasing shipper can decide whether to offer the space with partial day recall rights or not.  

The discussion of the order seems to be in step with ETS pipeline 637 proposals to only allow intraday capacity release/recall at the timely and evening cycles at this time and say that we would need to build additional validations and need more time if required to allow recalls during the flowing gas day.  The fact that comments aren't even being filed on phase 2 until Oct.  -- I think we're safe to assume that this phase won't be implemented until 2003.
