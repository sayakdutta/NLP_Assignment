Pinnacle West is still working on moving all its operations from Arizona 
Public Service Co. to Pinnacle. In the meantime, all TRANSMISSION deals 
should still be made using the counterparty name "Arizona Public Service 
Company." All other deals are made with "Pinnacle" itself. This should change 
sometime in the next month, according to the confirmation group in Houston. 
Let me know if you have any questions.
