Happy New Year -- 

The Executive Support Team would like to make you aware that we have 
experienced 2 instances of a particular issue relating to the Compaq IPAQ 
hand held devices.

ISSUE:  The screen will flip flop the text, rendering the device unusable.

We are researching the issue with Compaq to ascertain whether these instances 
are isolated, or if the problem is more widespread.

Should you experience any issue with your iPAQ, please contact me at ext.

Thank you
