Just a reminder that the next EGM weekly staff meeting will take place on 
Monday, January 8th, from 8:30 - 9:30 a.m., in video conference room EB 
32C2.  Due to the company holiday in observance of Martin Luther King day on 
Monday, January 15th, the staff meeting has changed dates and locations for 
that week only.  The staff meetings will resume their regular schedule on 
Monday, January 22nd, in EB 32C2, and will continue on a weekly basis on 
every Monday at the same time and location unless notified otherwise.  The 
schedule for the next three weeks is as follows:
