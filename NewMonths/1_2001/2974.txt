Greetings:
I received a call from Senator Haynes office today and talked extensively
about siting/repowering of generation as well as other environmental issues
affecting existing plants.  They (the Senator and his staff) would like to
meet tomorrow at 2:00 and I think it would be important to have a couple
people there that have specific examples/issues.  I don't want the meeting
to get to big (I'd like to keep it limited to 5-6 people) if you are
interested please let me know tomorrow morning.  They also want to know who
is coming so I will need a response by noon tomorrow.  Thanks and I
appreciate your response. Thanks.
