Did I write you back?  

Everything is going well here.  I like the work a lot, and I have some nice 
clients.  I can't wait for Carlos to get here, though.

I went to Izzo's going away reception last week.  Boy, there are a lot of new 
faces over there.

In in New York the rest of the week.  Maybe next week.  I hope you keep baby 
pictures with you at all times!

Kay,

How is everything going? I hear you are again working with Carlos.  
Congratulate him for me.

Are you free for lunch on Thursday or Friday next week?    I still have to 
show you some baby pictures of Reagan.
