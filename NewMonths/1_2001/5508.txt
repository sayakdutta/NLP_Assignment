Please see attached.  I suggest that Mark attend Houston Monday, March 19, 
2001 through Friday April 20, 2001.  I ask Mark to contact Jeff's assistant 
to make the necessary arrangements.

Hey Peter,

Due to my wife's pregnancy, I was hoping to schedule my secondment to Houston 
such that I would be back in Calgary no later than the end of April.  In this 
regard, I have managed to enrol in the Basics of Risk Management Course for 
March 29 - 30, 2001 (can be cancelled without charge up to March 26, 2001) 
and the Derivatives 1 Course for April 17 - 18, 2001 (can be cancelled 
without charge up to April 12, 2001).

If possible, I would like to begin the secondment on Monday, March 19, 2001 
and return to Calgary on Friday, April 20, 2001.  Please let me know what you 
think when you get the chance.

Thanks,

Mark.
