Please find attached a red-lined version of the Asset Purchase Agreement.  
Please forward any other comments to me for inclusion before I send this to 
ECO's attorneys.  Tommy please pay particular attention to the Excluded 
Assets section which Ed and I added software that we understood comprised all 
of the third party software.  Also, we have two other questions that we need 
for you to clarify.
