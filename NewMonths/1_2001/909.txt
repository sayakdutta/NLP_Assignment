I see that both of these deals have counterparty contact names in them now - 
did this get taken care of by somebody else? I'm sorry for the late response 
- I was out sick on Friday. Let me know if there's something else I can do on 
these deals.

There are two deals that do not have contact names.  Can you check with the 
trader and get him to enter names.  The confirmation has to have a contact 
name or it cannot be prepared.

Thanks!

Deals #500465 and #500467
