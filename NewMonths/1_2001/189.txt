Guys

There has been tremendous interest expressed already by generators, 
developers, and utilities to just about every coal producer about locating 
plants at mines. Some are moving forward. The most advanced appear to be 
Peabody (into TVA in western KY) EnviroPower (permitting three sites in Ky 
and Indiana) and Anker (permitting a site in W.Va). All sites are near 
transmission.

We can help locating sites , reserves and producers near transmission if we 
knew where the power needs are.
