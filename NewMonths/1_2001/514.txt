You and Chris already have your own room.  That was an old memo.

P.S.  We have always known that you didn't play well with others.

 

Guys, I'm not the sharing type  - book me in the Forest Room.

These are the dates that we are going to graceland.  I suggest we arrive on Thursday evening and come back Sunday afternoon.  I'll now hand over the arrangements to Tycholiz Travel Co.

Below is the availability of alternate rooms at the Inn at Spanish Bay for March 8-11, 2001:





If you would like to pay by credit card, I will need the type of card, number, name & expiration date on the card.  Along with the credit card information, I will need to know the names of the other 3 people attending.

I have reserved golf for Friday, March 9th at 7:20 a.m. at Links at Spanish Bay and Saturday, March 10th at 12:00 p.m. at Pebble Beach Golf Links.

Room availability is tight so we should move on this as soon as possible.  Please let me know how you would like to proceed with this event.
THANKS!
