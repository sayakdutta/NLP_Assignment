Griff,
  
Can you accomodate Dexter as we have in the past.  This has been very helpful 
in establishing a fair index at Socal Border.

Phillip,

I was wondering if I could trouble you again for another guest id for eol.
In previous months, it has helped us here at NGI when we go to set indexes.

I appreciate your help on this.

Dexter
