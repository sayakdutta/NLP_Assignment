Thanks.  Was in Sacramento all week watching the machinations.  I'll give you 
a call this week.  Best to you and yours.

Once again ... my sister was called by a reporter with the SF Chronicle
who's doing a story on  Enron.   The reporter heard about how my sister
escaped escalating  electricity costs in  San Diego because she switched to
Enron.  Sounds like a positive story.  May run this weekend.

Are you rethinking your decision about pulling out of the residential
market?  I would think  you could  sign most of San Diego.  When and if you
decide to reenter the market, we have some ideas we'd like to discuss.

Sue, who's handling pr for ARM?

Best to you both,

Ray
