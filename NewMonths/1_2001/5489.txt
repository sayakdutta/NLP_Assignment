We believe the password would have been sent to Mark Haedicke.  He will be 
back in the office tomorrow and Janette will try and locate it for us when he 
gets in.

Tana:
Last week Mark circulated a memo concerning the new ISDA Opinions that are 
now available on the ISDA website until the end of January.  Can you find out 
what our ID and Password are so we can access them?  Given Mark's illness, 
I'm not confident that this is something that he will be able to look into 
before the deadline.
