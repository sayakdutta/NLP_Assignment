Scott:
Thanks very much for the comments.  On the demand buy-down, I should have 
mentioned that I got a late call from the Gov's office asking for more detail 
on that proposal, which we'll likely forward along tomorrow morning, with the 
comments on the Gov's proposals.  Will try to work the other comments in.  
Thanks again.

Best,
Jeff

California within 2002; and 
running of existing older generation combined with mitigating reductions in 
emissions

 We are missing in decreasing load section

The California Public Utility Commission, will immediately seek bids, in the 
form of rate changes and regulatory commitments that would result in 2,000 MW 
of reduced on peak load by June 1, 2001
The California Public Utility Commission, will immediately seek bids, in the

1st Comments from Scott

We are missing:

Positive spin at front
Governor Davis is committed to solving the California energy crisis by:
Developing consumer driven solutions
Protecting customers from short term market aberrations
Continuing to expand the consumers ability to choose
We are missing thoughtful Orderly Process
Maintain 1890 in interim
All customers treated the same
Would replace "maintain a reliable distribution network" with "assure 
investment community"
Assurances around forward purchases
Assurances around prudent purchases to keep lights
Assurances, if needed through increases, via tax refundable.
Maintain AB1890 until orderly process arrives with better solution
Would drop specifics arount rate increase. 

More to come......
