Please reply to confirm receipt of this message.  I've received a
handful of reports that folks in our email groups are not getting some
messages, even though our software shows them in the groups, confirms
transfer of the messages, and we get no undeliverable messages back.
Sorry for bugging you, but we're trying to determine the extent and
cause of the problem.  Thanks. Don.
