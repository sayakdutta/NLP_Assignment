I'd agree with you on this.  Let's not confuse our purpose for being down 
there.   Also,  I'm trying to get Mike to go in my place.

Jeff, we talked last week about Ozzie Pagan coming to the FPL meeting.  My 
thoughts are that the deals Ozzie are talking about it are great and could 
very well be a part of what we do with the LNG deal, but I doubt the meeting 
will get to that level of detail.  If we get the LNG deal and a possible gas 
transaction on to FPL's radar screen, then we will have accomplished alot.  
Having Ozzie there as Enron's Florida power project developer may be too 
distracting.  As part of the many follow-up  meetings we will hope to have 
with FPL, Ozzie can make his pitch to them.

If you concur, I'll let Ozzie know.

Thanks
