I received another fax from, and then a telephone call from, Bernard Glatzer
today.  JJR was with me for the call (I felt that he deserved it).

What a bizarre man  The fax, which I will send you,
says to me (and Jerry Pecht, the lawyer for Bear Stearns) that "the
defendants and/or their attorneys breached the settlement agreement with me
in Glatzer vs. Bear Stearns, with whose confidential details Enron is fully
familiar."

I have no idea what this means, or is intended to convey.

Glatzer called and left word for me to call him back; I did.  He told JJR
and I that he was interested in settling his case against Enron.  I told him
that I would pass that on to Enron, but that my sense was that Enron thought
it had already won the case.  Glatzer said that, no, there were still things
he was planning to file, do, etc. and that it might be better for Enron to
settle with him now "before new lawyers come into the case."

I am sure lawyers are just lining up to take this one for him.

I told him that I could either pass on his comments to Enron, or he could
fax me a specific settlement demand.  He said he would do the latter,
sometime next week.

I have omitted all of the truly bizarre aspects of the conversation.  He did
giggle a lot, talk about President Bush's transition team, and ask me
whether I minded if he and I had a social conversation.

I will send you a copy of whatever I receive from him.
