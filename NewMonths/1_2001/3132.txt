Just a quick note to give you as much warning as possible.  The next phase of 
the office construction project will begin in a little over a week.  There is 
good news and bad news.  First the bad: the office which you currently occupy 
will be in the next construction phase.    Now the good:  it looks like we 
will probably have a place for you to sit until your new office is ready.  
Taffy Milligan will submit the move request (for next Friday - Jan. 12) and 
will have details directly.  Your assistants can help you order boxes and 
arrange your move.
