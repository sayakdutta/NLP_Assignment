Did you not hear me.  I said I was talking athletics.  Do you want me to 
break out academics with you?  I will be more than happy to discuss Auburn.  
Top 15 schools for your money, US News & World Report.   Behind the service 
academies, more astronauts than any other university.  Top ten among 
universities in terms of fortune 500 CEO's, Fortune Magazine.  

The point, don't try and act like LSU is the best school in the land.  Just 
because Enron doesn't recruit at some schools, doesn't mean they are inferior 
academically.  I would much rather have a degree from Tulane than LSU or 
Auburn, in terms of academic stature.  You should know that recruiting at 
Enron has and will always be political.  You have to have someone from that 
school in upper managment request trips be made.  I can promise you in the 
next 2-3 years they will be recruiting at Auburn.  I and anothe alum have 
already discussed it with HR.
