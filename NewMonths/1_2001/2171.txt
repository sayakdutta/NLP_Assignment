Hi there,

Thanks for taking my car in.  I admit I feel like men get treated better by 
car servicing people than women.  I'm not just saying that, either.

On the issue of Charlotte, is it your idea that she will take care of 
Tuesdays only while you are going to rodeo meetings?  I know in her email she 
had a preference for not doing the Sharon thing, and I do think we lost 
something when we (well, you) weren't communicating with Sharon or Amy in a 
regular basis.  I know it is easy for me to say since it is an inconvenience 
for you...
