Thanks. Mike's looking it over. Says it's not okay until he talks with 
Cominco, so it probably won't get faxed back right away, since these guys are 
in the middle of a busy trading morning. But I'll call or e-mail as soon as 
they've worked out a revised confirmation.

If you could go ahead and fax that to 503-464-3740, I'll have Mike take a 
look at it.
