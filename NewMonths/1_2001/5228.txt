Stephanie:

Happy New Year!

I have assigned you to this former Marie Heard file.  We need to overnight 
copies of the master agreement (boilerplate and all) to Neel Lemon in 
Dallas.  He does not need ENA's or the CP's background documentation.  You 
can send the ENE guaranty.  This company has undergone a franchise tax 
restructuring and has survived as a limited partnership which we are in the 
process of evaluating.  I'll bring the file to you.   Details to follow 
soon.  SS

Sara, you have my permission to communicate with Neel Lemon at Baker Botts
as you would with me.  Please call me anytime.  214 515 6401.

Forest Felvey





Sara:

Here is my contact info.  Please send me yours.

Please feel free to call Forest Felvey at CSI to check signals on the
confidentiality agreement issue you mentioned.  He will verify that Baker
Botts is assisting CSI on swap issues and that it is okay to communicate
with me.  [I've copied Forest with this email for his info.]

As we discussed, I will get you copies of the new LPS documentation relating
to the 2000 CSI franchise tax restructuring and you will get me copies of
the existing Enron/CSI contractual documentation relating to the original
1998 arrangements and any amendments, etc., since then.

Thereafter, we can figure out what our next steps are.

Thanks.
