"Pretty tired" is the understatement of the century. What a way to kick off 
my New Year's Resolution of staying home on weeknights. And things promise to 
only get worse - I think Amber and I are getting a place together. I'm not 
sure I'll survive another month of this kind of social life.

You know, "date with destiny" is getting a little old. Can you come up with 
something more original?
