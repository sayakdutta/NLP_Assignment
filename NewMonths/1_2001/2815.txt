Jeff, thanks so much!  Don't know how I missed this email last night.
Really appreciate it, and look forward to receiving the remaining material.
The Governor referenced the nordpool last night in a session, so this will
make our research alot easier, at least on that one!!!




Greetings Kari:

Attached is follow-up information from the meeting that the Governor and
you had with Ken Lay and Steve Kean last Thursday.  Tomorrow morning I will
email three additional pieces of information:

   Our specific comments on the proposals that the Governor raised at the
   meeting.
   More details on the "demand buy-down" concept.
   Information on Norway's version of the ISO, "Nord Pool."

If there's anything you need, don't hesitate to contact me at 415.782.7822.

Happy New Year.

Best,
Jeff
