Greetings:

See attached "meeting notice."  This could be a good opportunity to get our 
demand-side proposal on the table.  

Dennis:  If we could get some power point slides together, we could present 
our ideas to this group and the leg aides mentioned.  Let me know your 
thoughts. 

Also attached is a summary of the bill that the CA Assembly passed today.  
Please pass this along to others who might be interested. Thanks.

Jeff
