Gee, when's the Super Bowl?  That was nice of her.  

My day is HECTIC, but what's new. I can't seem to get any traction on getting 
things done.

Michael wanted to go to Jilian's tonight, but I told him no.

I just got a call from Tami Terry inviting us to a Super Bowl party at their
house...

Laddie called to confirm lunch tomorrow and said to tell you hi...
