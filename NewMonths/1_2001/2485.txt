Hi.  Who can meet when?




I don't know if we're going to get everyone on one call!  I've only got 2 
responses and one can only meet in the a.m. and one can only meet in the pm.  
What fun!

Sheila is out of town and would like to reschedule this week's conference 
call for Friday.  Would 9:00 a.m. CT or 2:30 p.m. CT work for you guys?  
Please let me know ASAP so I can change the call information, etc.  Thanks, 
Suzanne
