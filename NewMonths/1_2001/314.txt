Bob Badeer informed me that these deals have already been confirmed, possibly 
by you. Could you let me know if this is in fact true? If it is, I will go 
ahead and make a note in the comments section of the deals.

Thanks,
Kate

There are two deals for Avista the are marked not to be confirmed.  Can you 
check into these, and if they are not to be confirmed, put a little note as 
to why or who said not to confirm them, so 6 months from now when someone 
says "Why didn't you confirm this deal!"  I'll have something to jog my 
memory.  (Because I will have slept between now and then!)

Deal Numbers #487050 and 487054

Thanks!
