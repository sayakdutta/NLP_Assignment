dinner around 7ish will be fine - but we will come  out earlier to help out 
and have drinks








Hi Eric,

I don't think you want to look at it.  Notice that it is just one block from
the railroad tracks.  Talk about noise!

What time do you want to have dinner Saturday night?  I just got back from
the grocery store so everything is ready to prepare.  I will email Shanna
next.  Talk to you in a bit.  LU-M
