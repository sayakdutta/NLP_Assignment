Hi Sue:  

Hope all is well in the land of forward contracts.  Do we know who the 
speakers are?  Is Dave Parquet attending for us?

Thanks.
Jeff

Greetings:
For those of you attending the Republican Caucus briefing tomorrow it is in
room 126 and runs from 9-noon (from what we understand it will be close
quarters so arrive early if you have been invited to speak). This meeting is
open to those who have been invited only.

Attached please find the agenda. IEP will be handing out the Seeing the
Light document, Power Up, and the editorial from the Bee today.  We will be
following up with the FAQ's with a letter to each attendee on Friday.

I have also attached the Final FAQ and Glossary of Terms.  Please let us
know by 2:00 tomorrow if you have any changes or additions to these
documents.

Thanks!
