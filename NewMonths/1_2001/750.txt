Dear Mark,

As per this letter from Bob Pickel, I wonder if you (assuming you are Enron's 
"Primary ISDA contact") would be able to send me our Firm ID and password 
when you have a chance so that I can access the online versions of the 
documents.

Thanks very much and thanks for the card.  Hoping you and your family had a 
happy holiday and wishing you all the best for 2001.

Jane McBride
