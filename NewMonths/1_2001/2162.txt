Hi Jeffrey,

I'm not handling change orders for the individual projects.  I'm checking 
with Stuart (he's the COA deal  lawyer) to get a consensus on the best way to 
handle this.

Ben/Rebecca,

There are several changes which we have been asked to proceed with for which 
we
have not received contract change notices.

They are:

1)   Hauling and Installation of City of Austin Transformers (LNL9521-1 & -2)
$93,200.00.
2)   An additional crane for the City of Austin transformers (ABB S O Nos.
LNL9521-1 & -2) during the hauling and installation $9504.00.  Verbal OK from
Ben to Mike.
3)   A change authorized by D. Hammond/Enron to the Las Vegas Transformers
(LNL9518-1 & -2) including redesign costs, additional radiators and use of 
high
delivery fans.  $49,500.00 X 2 = $99,000.00.
4)   On 11/15/00 Mike Coleman advised ABB St. Louis to proceed on 
(modification
of the covers/bushing turrets for use at higher altitude) on the Fountain
Project Colorado transformers(LNL9518-1 -2 & -3).
We have not received a change order in the amount of $15,200.00 X 3 =
$45,600.00.

There is also one (Item 5 below) pending authorization to proceed.

5)   We await authorization to proceed and a change order from Ed 
Dannhaus/Enron
for the Fountain Project Colorado transformers (LNL9517-1-2 & -3) to proceed 
to
add 2 air terminal chambers to each of these transformers $19,500.00 per
transformers X 3 =  $58,500.00

Will these items be included in the facility agreement?

Please call if you need additional information regarding the above.

Regards,
Karla
