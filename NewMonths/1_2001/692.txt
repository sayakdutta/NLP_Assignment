We forwarded the translated complaint to Risk Management for review. Rob Cole 
has indicated that it is a Risk Management matter and has asked that the Unit 
assist Risk Management in obtaining local counsel and in providing a defense. 
I will discuss the details with Rob on his return to the office next week and 
will report the results of our analysis and recommendations.

Becky, Please copy Dave will the summons and complaint. This should be the 
system for all services involving any matter in  Puerto Rico. 

Bob, Are you still handling SJG matters or should this be sent to Richard 
Sanders?

Dave, Please advise Bob, Richard, and me of the nature of the dispute.

Thanks to each of you.
