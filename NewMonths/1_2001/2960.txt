Jeff:

As discussed last week, we distributed the ICA Memo's to Sue and Donald and 
sent the CA tariffs to Mona in SF.   Please let me know if these documents 
need to go to anyone else at Enron. 
You had also indicated you wanted more information on "costs" for the next 
EBS (or ETI) states of Washington and Oregon (and Utah).  The state filing 
fees should not be overly significant, and we can provide specific numbers -  
though if by "costs" you refer to legal fees, perhaps Steve can best address 
that area. 
You can expect, fortunately or unfortunately, somewhat similar paper 
processes for Wa, Or, and Ut as was done in CA.  There will necessarily be 
issues that Enron will want to first discuss internally, such as disclosure 
of requested financial info. for Wa, before any filing. 
We can send you the forms for each state so you get a feel for what is 
required, or we can capsulize them in a Memo, and/or schedule a call with 
Steve and Anita to go over specific EBS concerns. Let me know your 
preference. To also confirm, you indicated WA as the first priority state, 
with Scott overseeing. 
We are otherwise proceeding as planned. Thanks, 
Jeremy Meier
