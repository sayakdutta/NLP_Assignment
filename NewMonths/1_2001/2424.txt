Hi Chris,

Happy New Year.  Hope all is going well with you.  We miss you!

I heard a rumor that the UI deal had an asset management aspect to it.  The 
guys around here are kicking around some different asset management ideas, so 
I'm trying to get my hands on any docs which might give some insight into 
some  different approaches.  Do you have anything you can email me?

Thanks,

Kay
