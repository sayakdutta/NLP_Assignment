John:

I talked with Mark Haedicke this morning regarding the best way to get you 
connected for the Monday morning staff meetings.  He would like you to let 
both him and I know (possibly by the preceding Friday Houston time) at what 
number he can call you to conference you into the meeting each Monday morning.

We discussed getting a bridgeline; however, it is best if Mark calls the 
various participants and adds them in by conference call.  

Thank you.
