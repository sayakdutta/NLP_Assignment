Everything is short and sweet except the caption!  One comment.  The very 
last sentence reads :  PG&E can continue to physically divert gas if 
necessary . . . "  SInce they haven't actually begun to divert yet, let's 
change that sentence to read "PG&E has the continuing right to physically 
divert gas if necessary..."  

I will send this around for comment.  Thanks for your promptness.

Any comments, anyone?
