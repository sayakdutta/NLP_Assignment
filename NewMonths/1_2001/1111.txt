John,

I have received your message regarding Mike Roberts. I could not
agree more. Mike deserves to be compensated for his exceptional
contribution.

Additional recommendation. I think that all weather forecasting support
should be consolidated under Mike (including the weather guys supporting 
power trading). In my view, it was a mistake to remove Mike from
power support. It would also mean a lot to him personally.
