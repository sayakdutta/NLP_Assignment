Taffy,

Mary is the new lawyer in charge of the paralegals (someone needs to keep us 
in line, being the wild and crazy gals we are!).  Can you put these 
re-occuring meetings on my calendar and call it "Paralegal Lunch Meeting".  
Thanks!

Please note that we will commence our lunch meetings together as of Thursday 
February 15th from 11:45 to 1:00.  The meetings will generally recur every 
two weeks thereafter so mark your calendars.  I will let you know the 
location as soon as we find an open conference room.

Carla, by copy to you please find a conference room and schedule it for the 
recurring time as above stated and let us know which room.  Also, set on your 
calendar reminders for emailing a reminder to the paralegals and myself each 
Wednesday prior to the Thursday meeting, and for ordering lunch/drinks for 
each meeting.  Also set a recurring meeting on my calendar noting this 
meeting schedule.

Thanks.

Cordially,
Mary Cook
