Ok, Sarah Wesner is not attending and Beth has to come so I've got little 
choice.  I can cut off one more but everyone said no at first and then just 
came back and said yes.  Initially I was going to have to speak so it was 
going to be 4 people and then you can go to speak so that makes 5.  Beth 
included is 6.

Do we really need 7 people to attend this event?

Again, review the event sheet and confirm your hotel dates and contact me
