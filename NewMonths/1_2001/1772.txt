I don't think this will work.  We have offices on 50M but two are set aside 
for board members and one (the one Rob Walls recently left) is going to be 
tied up with a video crew working on the analyst meeting.

I left you a voice mail message earlier today, but let me tell you what we 
need to know.  Rick Causey is moving Melissa Becker to a new role within his 
organization and needs to have her close for at least the short term.  We 
know that there is an office empty on 50M and we were wondering if we might 
use it for Melissa until we work out some other spaces issues.  

Thanks, Sharron
