Hmmm, sounds like the pressure's getting to Mike a bit.  A vacation might 
help.  I think you're entitled to continue on, if that's your decision.  You 
may not have the attendance you prefer, but I don't oppose moving the Gas 
Accord talks forward.

Once again I implore you to put at stop to this madness and hold any 
further "Gas Accord II" settlement
discussions in abeyance until the current electricity crisis has 
abated.  There is neither the time nor the mental capacity to deal with all 
of these issues at the same time.  For God's sake, STOP 
IT!!!                                                              Mike Florio
