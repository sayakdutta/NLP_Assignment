Alan Sommer, Mike Patrick and Bruce Garner have now left Enron Net Works.  
Alan has joined Rick Causey's group to run the SAP function and Bruce has 
moved into EIM to run their European Operations.  Mike Patrick has moved to 
work for Wes Colwell in Enron Wholesale's accounting group.

Bruce's European group  will report up under Andy and his Houston group will 
report up under Greg.

Kerry Roper, as you know, has already joined to replace Mike.

We wish them all the best in their new roles and apologies if I have not 
included exactly the right titles for those of you moving on.

Louise
