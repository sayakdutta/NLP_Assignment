Just a thought:  I'm assuming it will be too difficult to build in customized 
credit provisions on a counterparty by counterparty basis on-line - but if 
there are master agreements in place, the  credit provisions contained in 
them would apply to on-line trades.  The availability of the on-line system 
may therefore encourage more master agreements since the Credit Dept. will 
limit a counterparty's trading volume until credit terms can be imposed.
