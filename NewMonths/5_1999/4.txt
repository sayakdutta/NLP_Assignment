Mark, I mentioned this problem several weeks ago.  Did you ever respond to 
Willie's most recent inquiry?  Sara

To  maintain  a  more  accurate  record  of  deal  statuses,  I  have  been  
instructed  by  my  manager,  Jeff Sorenson  to
  have  the  Confirm  Center  to  execute  Ominibus  confirmations  returned  
to  us  without  the  attachments, (mainly  the  
  Annex  A).  These  deals  have  all  been  matched-up  and  signed  
satisfactorily  by  the  counterparties,  except  that 
  the  attachments  were  not  returned  with  the  executed  confirmations.  
Legal  will  continue  to    address  this  issue
  until  resolved,  when  time  permits,  for  my  request  for  a  letter  
of  approval  of  a  new  policy  making  the  return  of
  most  common  attachments  unnecessary.  However,  unless  otherwise  
instructed ,  we    will    be    executing    these 
  confirms  without  the  attachments  effective  immediately  5/9/99.

  PS:  I  will  be  out  on  Monday  and  Friday,  5/10/99  and  5/14/99;  


comments.  Thanks!
