Credit needs to initiate (and it may have to be London credit) but Tanya 
Rohauer will know.  FYI - London told us that Sempra "will not trade with ECT 
International."   SS



If we anticipate having to document any trades under ECT International Carl 
Petersen is going to want a Master set up with that entity.  Who needs to 
initiate that?

Thanks,
Jeff
