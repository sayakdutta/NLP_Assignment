Thanks Sara. I called John late yesterday and left a voice mail saying that 
we could begin pricing the deal while the lawyers worked on the ISDA.  I have 
not heard from him yet, either.  I will let you know if anything progresses 
on the deal side.  Will you let me know what progresses on the ISDA and legal 
side.  Also, if I am around, will you let me know when the conference call 
with the lawyers is.   I would like to sit in on the call.  Hopefully,  I 
will speak with John today and hear more about it.  Since I inherited this 
account from someone who recently left Enron, I don't know John as well as I 
would if he had been my client all along.  Of course,  I am not complaining - 
always happy to inherit a client ready to do a deal.

Thanks again for your help.

Lisa
