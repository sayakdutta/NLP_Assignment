I have received the executed First Amendment to ISDA Master Agreement dated 
as of May 25, 1999.  This amendment deletes the prior Confidentiality 
provision in the ISDA Master Agreement and replaces it with our current 
Confidentiality language.  This change will allow either party to provide 
copies of the agreement to its Affiliates.  Copies will be distributed.
