We should move forward with this waiver.   From a credit standpoint, I do not 
see any issues with releasing the Master to an affiliate.

Please note that I will be requesting a guaranty from the parent to cover 
Duke Energy International.

Regards,

Pat Cini

In response to your email, yes, our confidentiality language was so limited 
that it did not allow us to provide the agreement to affiliates of either 
party without consent.  We revised the form about 9 months ago to broaden the 
langage to include affiliates, but Duke is an old master so they need our 
consent so they can provide it to their affiliate.  Unless Federico has any 
reason not to waive the language, I think we can go ahead & draft a waiver up 
here and send it to Duke.  Can you talk to Federico asap and run that by him 
and let me know so I can get this over to Duke.  Thanks!
