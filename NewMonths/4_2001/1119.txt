I spoke with Paul Choi, the mid-marketer who did this deal, and he said the 
deal should be with The City of Oakland, a municipal corporation, not Port of 

when Risk is done with the calc.

Thanks,
Kate


   
	
	
		



Sorry.  I guess it's time to bring out the glasses.  The number is 576228.  

Thanks!

I get a "no records selected" message when I try to pull up 576220. ????


   
	
	
		



Can you check and make sure this is the correct counterparty on this deal?  
We did a deal in February (#533916) with a little different name.  Also we 
will need a counterparty contact.

Thanks!
