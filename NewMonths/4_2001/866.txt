Christopher,

Attached is ENA's standard form of contract for a bilateral confidentiality 
agreement and relating to power and transmission projects.  Please fill in 
the company name and address in the appropriate spaces.   Also, please copy 
your draft CA to the above distribution list at the same time you send it to 
the counterparty.  We have penciled in the 24th of April for a meeting in 
Phoenix with the counterparty.

As we discussed, you will be directly contacting Mitch to discuss your 
concerns regarding the budget issues relating to this potential project.

JMoore
