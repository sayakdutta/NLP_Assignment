Hi Richard,

I wanted to discuss with you two open items with you re: our voice recorder 
policy.

On the authorization to listen to conversations, we cannot comply with the 
requirement that an MD authorize it because we have no MD on site.  Given the 
size of our office, etc. I can suggest some people that would be appropriate 
in lieu of an MD.  Insofar as who should be present, we are suggesting that 
the IT person be present to run the playback, together with myself and the 
person who authorized the playback.

On the retention policy, the policy presently applicable is fine for most of 
our personnel.  One of our companies, Enron Trading Services Inc. is 
regulated by the CFTC and the NFA, who impose a 5 year records keeping 
requirement.  We can purchase a separate system for the traders in that 
company for a cost of about $20,000.  

Please let me know when you will have a moment to discuss.

Thanks,

Limor
