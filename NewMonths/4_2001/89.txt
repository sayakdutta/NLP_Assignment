Eric and I will come by ~4:00.  Thanks,  Charlie



We are going to talk with Shankman tomorrow and so was wondering if you could refresh the prices for the collars in the attached file.  Fairly similar to what we priced yesterday, but we only have 2 volume increments.  Also, we need to price this as an annual deal with 1 exercise at the end of each calendar year.  (2010 would be exercised on 12/31/2010).  Also, we need to refresh the fixed price quotes on the last sheet in the attached file as well.  These prices I asked John Griffith about last friday.  Use tonights close if you don't mind.

Please let me know if you have any questions,  

Thanks again,

eric
