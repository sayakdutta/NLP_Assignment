Payment Date	Payment Amount
April 30, 2001	$50,234,000
	
	
TOTAL	$50,234,000

Such April 30th payment shall constitute full and final payment for the 
Units, except that Purchaser shall be responsible for the payment of any and 
all amounts associated with any Change Order after the Effective Date. The 
final payment is also subject to Section 6.1.3.  

Also, Delta has suggested that we add in language for the adjustment due to 
site conditions.  I added language to Exhibit A-1.

Both of these edits are from the CA form.
