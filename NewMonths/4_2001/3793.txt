Hi Wilson,

I've decided that it would be helpful to have a brief written explanation of 
what limits of liability and waivers of consequential damages are permissable 
under Mississippi law when contracting with the Cities or an energy 
authority.  Could you provide me with something along that line?

Thank you,

Kay
