GOVERNOR DAVIS SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDERS 
TO PROVIDE POWER TO CALIFORNIA
SACRAMENTO 
Governor Gray Davis has signed three executive orders to increase 
stabilization, conservation and generation of power in California. 
Executive Order D-34-01
Many numerous and complicated statutes, regulations, policies and procedures 
are delaying deployment of the energy conservation funding outlined in SB 5X 
and AB 29X signed by the Governor two weeks ago. Executive Order D-34-01 will 
speed up implementation of the measures.
Together, the two bills provide over $850 million for energy conservation and 
distributed generation programs designed to save over 2,000 megawatts this 
summer. With the Executive Order, the Energy Commission will not have to go 
through the cumbersome process of guideline adoption to approve funding. The 
programs in the demand reduction program that will be streamlined included:
Public Agency Loans and Grants (ECAA); 
Time-Of-Use and Real-Time Meters; 
Municipal Program; and 
Cool Roofs/Building Materials
Executive Order D-33-01
Governor Davis signed Executive Order D-33-01 to extend the conservation 
rebate of the "20/20" program to the customers in the territory serviced by 
the San Diego Gas and Electric Company. The program is designed to help the 
state avoid the likelihood of blackouts this summer and reward consumers who 
significantly conserve energy. In addition, it could save the state up to 
$1.3 billion in power costs by reducing the amount of electricity the state 
must buy during expensive summer peak periods. 
Executive Order D-32-01
In Executive Order D-32-01, Governor Davis orders the transfer of funds from 
the Energy Commission to the Department of Water Resources for implementation 
of the power plant construction incentive program. Incentives will include: 
$5,000 per megawatt (MW) of average electrical output on the first 100 MW and 
$2,500 per MW for each MW above 100 MW, if brought on-line by July 1, 2001; 
$4,000 per MW of average electrical output on the first 100 MW and $2,000 per 
MW for each MW above 100 MW, if brought on-line between July 2, 2001 and 
August 1, 2001; and 
$3,000 per MW of average electrical output on the first 100 MW and $1,500 per 
MW for each MW above 100 MW, if brought on-line between August 2, 2001 and 
August 31, 2001.
