Did Chris Foster ever get back to you on this? I had asked him to let you 
know when he found out, but I wanted to make sure the information actually 
got passed along. Let me know when you get a moment.

Thanks,
Kate

FYI.  Please let us know if we will be receiving broker paper in Houston or 
will it come to Portland?

The counterparty has been linked to the Power Broker - Houston Group.

P.S. I mentioned this to you, Melissa. But just a reminder that we need the 
default broker fee on this to be $.03.

Thank you!

Chris Foster has requested that we set up a new broker - the Automated Power 
Exchange, in EnPower. It is the same counterparty we already have in EnPower, 
with the same name and contact information. Melissa, I believe you said we 
could pretty easily add the name in the broker list if it was the same as in 
the counterparty list, which Chris has verified it is. Please let me know if 
you need anymore information.

Thanks,
Kate
