I figured you knew, but I thought I'd better be certain.  I'm wondering about 
Bart, too.  Bob said he (Bob) is getting a nice raise, and I heard he got a 
signing bonus.  Oh, I heard it from Dan,, so you probably know.   

Are they looking for someone to replace Pat?  I like Glenn, the temp on 31 
who was working for Ben.  I don't know his skills, but he is great on the 
phone.

Yes, I knew about both of them.  You know I have my 
sources to keep me informed as to what's going on.  I 
figured Bob Carter would leave.  It was just a feeling.  
I guess Sheila will have to replace him and Al Larsen in 
Portland.  I bet she's a crazy woman.

Oh, you should see the roots on my hair!  I'm so glad 
I'm getting it done on Thursday!  I look like a skunk!  
Thank goodness my hair is curly!!!!!  I was thinking 
about putting on some makeup to go to the doctor, but I 
think not.  I'll do good to get my hair dry!  I'm 
feeling tired today, but maybe it's because I didn't 
sleep all that well last night.  I've been so hot lately 
and having nightsweats.  What fun getting older is!

Are you feeling any better?
