Attached is FERC authorization for EPMI and EES to purchase power from indu=
strials NATIONWIDE (effective March 6, 2001--Does not expire).  The industr=
ial does not have to obtain its own power marketer license from FERC (subje=
ct to EPMI and EES making certain after the fact quarterlty filings for the=
 industrials).=20

Specifics:

Owners of generating facilities located at business locations and used prim=
arily for back-up for self-generation (who will be "public utilities" subje=
ct to the Federal Power Act only while they sell at wholesale) can sell pow=
er at wholesale from such facilities to EPMI and EES without prior notice u=
nder section 205 of FPA (would usually require 60 day advance notice filing=
). =20
=09 -- Waives certain parts of the filing requirements for the industrial; =
however, the industrial will still be subject to shortened filing requireme=
nts for dispositions of facilities and interlocking positions while they ar=
e selling at wholesale.
=09-- EPMI and EES will make the FERC quarterly filings on behalf of the in=
dustrials for any of these purchases.  Our report must show the names of th=
e industrial; aggregate amount of capacity and/or energy purchased from eac=
h seller; and the aggregate compensation paid to each seller.  Accounting/c=
ommercial folks for EPMI and EES-- please make sure these purchases are fla=
gged in the accounting system, since the report will be separate from our b=
ig quarterly reports.
=09-- This does not authorize the retail industrial customer to violate any=
 rules or tariffs of its host utility.  This does not authorize an industri=
al to resell power it purchases (only can sell what it generates); unless o=
therwise allowed (or not precluded) by its retail tariff.

West Desk:  This is similar to the authorization that FERC gave last week t=
o purchases from industrials in WSCC.
