I'm writing on behalf of Jeff Skilling regarding scheduling a 20-minute 
conference call to discuss the above referenced presentation/panel discussion 
at the Houston Chapter YPO (Young Presidents Organization) meeting.  Jeff is 
available the afternoon of Thursday, April 12, between the hours of 3:00 p.m. 
and 5:00 p.m. (CDT).  Please let me know what your availability is during 
this time period, and I'll be back in touch to nail down an exact time or to 
suggest an alternative date/time.

Thank you very much for your commitment to this event and for your patience 
in awaiting the details.  I look forward to hearing from each of you soon.
