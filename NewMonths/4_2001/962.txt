That was our original plan---at this point I have no way of knowing---but I 
would guess that we would be arriving Fri morning. My life is not my own 
right now because of the crisis in California. Last night, I was named as the 
Enron rep. to the Pacific Gas & Energy creditors committee--a totally 
thankless and time-consuming job. I may be leaving for CA tonight. Either 
way, Julie will be ther on Fri.
