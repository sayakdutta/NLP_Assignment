All of these deals had their facilities changed by logistics on the last two 
days.  I have reiterated to Lisa Kinsey the importance of her group letting 
us know when they make a change in facility.  All of these were physical 
basis trades, so they came at contract - the desk price difference is not 
more than .04 on any of the deals.  OA therefore should be minimal.
