Welcome back.  I know you are probably really busy.  

Paige will be coming home on Thursday.  I told her we might not be leave for 
PH until Saturday.  I want Michael to be able to go to the Easter egg hunt 
here if he wants to.  I don't know Paige's plans beyond Thursday.

Since you've been out of town so much, would it help if I took off Friday so 
that you can catch up?  That still leaves Monday.  

Glad you are back!

Kay
