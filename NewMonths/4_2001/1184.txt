This deal was a physical payback to WAPA, and it should be in at a zero 
price. I've added a comment into the deal to explain this, and I asked Holden 
to put comments in any weird deals he enters from now on. Thanks for catching 
this - it does need to be confirmed.

This deal has no price entered -should we not confirm it?  or is it wrong?
Thanks!
