Gracias. 

Can you see the mountains today?

Kay







Hola Kay-I reviewed the revised letter agreement sent to us on Sunday and it
looks good to me.  The draft assumes that the change orders get signed,
though you will note there is still a covenant regarding the moving of the
turbine.

See you soon.  Ciao-John
