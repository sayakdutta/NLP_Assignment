I'll mention to Shapiro.  I think that it would be perfect.

By the way, if the whole damn state had just listened to a few very bright 
people in the CPUC we would have alot more free time.

Today's the 7th anniversary of the release of the California Commission's now 
infamous "Blue Book" that launched Direct Access.  Would it be bad taste for 
Skilling to note the anniversary on the call with Bryson?

Viva Choice....

Best,
Jeff
