We will keep the 10 am meeting on Tuesday, April 24, EB 38C2 (legal and 
credit only).
We will also schedule a meeting at 3 pm (same day after legal/credit regular 
meeting) with Fred, Caroline, Russell Dyk and Robyn Zivic.  Fred could not 
meet in the morning and he is an integral part of the process we are trying 
to develop for hedge funds.  I apologize if all of the lawyers cannot meet at 
3 pm but at least one lawyer in attendance should keep us on track.
