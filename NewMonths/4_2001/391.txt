Dan --

We will soon be sending two executed copies of the "Enron OnLine" amendment
(with an exhibit B as an attachment) to you.

To which address should we send?

Thank you,

Dave Anderson 415-973-6659




Thanks, Dan!





Dave,
     As we discussed, the change that you made referring to the index for
the applicable delivery point is okay because the Index for Enron Online is
the Midpoint price in Gas Daily for the location closet to the relevant
delivery point.  I do not think that your change affects that.  Therefore,
please finalize the amendment, have it signed and forward to me for
execution by Enron.




                    "Anderson,

                    David W

Dan -

Per our conversation today, I made a change to the "exhibit B"
confirmation.
If you could let me know that it's OK, we will make change and execute.

Thanks,
