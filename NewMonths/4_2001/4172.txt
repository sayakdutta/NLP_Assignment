Here's the document that I referenced.  Dan Allegretti asked me to forward it 
to you.  He'd like to distribute to the leadership team and have it on the 
agenda during his part of the conference call.  Thanks a million.

Best,
Jeff

Much obliged; I promised in return to forward this legislative outline, and I
look forward to your views.
