As we discussed, attached is my "Cheat Sheet" which I use to guide me when 
approving non-US counterparties that come in through EnronOnline via Houston 
Credit.  London Legal and I try to coordinate our responses but I cannot 
speak for them and the standards they may apply to approving counterparties 
to trade online.  They also frequently deal with different countries than 
us.  You may want to speak to Justin Boyd.  Generally, with respect to most 
physical trading, except power trading, there are no legal restrictions to 
trading.  Most of the restrictions in this list are with respect to financial 
products.  Physical bandwidth has generally not done much legal due diligence 
outside of the US and the UK and bandwidth is therefore not open to non US 
and UK counterparties.

With physical power, generally, in most countries they require some sort of 
power marketing license so I look to the power lawyers to guide me.

As I also mentioned, for Japan or Australian based counterparties I wait for 
David Minns or Jane McBride to advise me.
