Ok to incorporate language referring to ERCOT/West product that we trade 
under EEI (West firm should already be handled and ERCOT confirms talk about

OK maybe to modify transmission contingent but need to clarify why with 
Harlan and then advice/discuss w traders.  We do not commonly use those 
definitions
