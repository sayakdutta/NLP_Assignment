3 nights out in a row would be a bit much for this ol girl.

Thanks for the offer (and the call) but I haven't been able to secure a 
sitter for Michael.  

My schedule should be getting better (famous last words), and I hope we can 
get together soon.  I would like to introduce you to Carlos Sole, if you 
haven't met him yet.

Thanks again,

Kay









I noticed this morning that the firm's Diamond Box seats for tonight's game 
against St. Louis had not been claimed and so claimed them.  I apologize for 
the late notice, but if you would be interested in going tonight, I would be 
happy to make them available to you and your spouse, date, etc.  I'm still 
trying to arrange my schedule to go, but wanted you to have the opportunity, 
even if I couldn't make it.  Please call me or my secretary, Becky, at your 
earliest convenience to let me know if you would like to use these tickets.
