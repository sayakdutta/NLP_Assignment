I'm not sure what he's waiting for. Any ideas?

 Ben,

We are waiting for the insurance information necessary to perform a risk
mitigation analysis. The insurance report received  indicates that their
position is that only a partial repair is necessary. Siemens Westinghouse's
position is that a complete repair is required to restore design reliability
and operational capabilities. A budgetary estimate to perform the required
repairs has been submitted to Enron.


Looking forward to hearing from you.

Regards,

Bill Monahan
