Good morning Jeff,

Perhaps you could help me with something.  Our DSL provider, in an
effort to eliminate SPAM, has decided to limit group e-mails to 25
recipients or less.  My Enron list is considerably longer.  Based on a
previous e-mail, could you please give me an idea as to who I can
eliminate?  I've never heard of many people on the current list.

Thank you.

Scott
