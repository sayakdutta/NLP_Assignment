Read the attached affidaviot which Steve Schindler faxed me.  Glatzer seems
to create interesting and exotic jurisdictional issues wherever he goes.
And to think I never had known there was a Mrs. Bernbie and, apparently, a
little Bernie Jr. and Bernadette.  As to your question, Steve, who knows?
Perhaps this will become the new outlet for Bernie's pro bono talents.  But
with him you never know.  The negative view would be:  he is still
litigating his 1986 divorce decree 15 years later, so why do we think he
will leave us alone now or next decade?  The only thing I am looking forward
to is his Complaint against Hayes....
