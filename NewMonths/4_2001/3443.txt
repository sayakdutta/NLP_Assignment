This is the form which needs to be cleaned up.  I may have a cleaned up 
version.  I'll check.

Here you go.  It's pretty specific to the Pastoria contract, but has been 
blessed by Mike Barnas (subject, of course, to GE getting what they want on a 
guaranty!!!  grrrr).

Hi Karen,

Could I get a copy of whatever the latest version is of the GE consent for 
Pastoria?  We have a potential deal coming up to move some frames out of 
TurboPark, so I would like to see the current state-of-the-are version.

Thanks,

Kay
