Thanks for handling.  Let me know if it begins to interfere unduly with your 
new responsibilities.

Thanks.  I am seeing a few things through to conclusion, and I expect this 
situation to be one, unless Steve prefers to handle it differently.  I think 
it is a matter of either him or me, and I think this is one item I can keep 
off of his plate.  thanks  mcs

Mark,

Congratulations on your new assignment.  It has been a long time since I have 
dealt with Coal but the business desperately needed new ideas and approaches 
when I knew it.  Good luck!

Yes, I did meet with JoAnn last Friday.  As required by the agreement she 
gave me, I have retained counsel and the proposal is being reviewed by my 
attorney.  In light of the announced change, I am wondering if questions and 
comments should still be addressed to you?  Please advise.

Mike D.
