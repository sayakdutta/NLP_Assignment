I am scheduling a meeting to discuss Processing accounting issues and would 
like to have it on Tuesday, 4/10 in the afternoon or sometime Wednesday, 
4/11.  It is critical that each individual identified above be able to attend 
in order to address all of the issues.  Please let me know your availability 
so that I may schedule a time that everyone may attend.

Thanks for your assistance.
