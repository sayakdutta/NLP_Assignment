Lexi,

I would like to volunteer for the Information Session on September 17.  My apologies for not being able to help out with this year's spring recruiting, but from the beginning of October through last Friday I couldn't take a single day off from work.  Fortunately, I'm in a new rotation and they have a bit more flexibility when it comes to my schedule.

Thanks,
Susan
