Actually you picked a good week to make the transition since we'll be at the 
law conference Wed-Friday.  You can ease into things again without us 
hovering.

Boy, you sure know how to make me feel good!  Sheila 
said she was so sad I wouldn't be back until the 30th.  
The doc said my abs were good and tight, but I can't do 
any ab work until one more month.  Wait until you see 
me, I'm a shadow of my former self with all that 
swelling gone.  I feel so much better.  I can't eat very 
much any more either.  I can drink though!!!!!!!!!

Well, if you aren't going to work until I get back, then 
you need to come over and we can go hang out!!!! 
Wouldn't that be a hoot!
