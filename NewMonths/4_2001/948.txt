Hi Richard,

I have a document to fax to you from Mary Nell re: House of Lords Opinions of 
the Lords of Appeal for Judgment in the Cause.  I have looked on the Houston 
Intranet site and your fax number is not on it.  Would you please email me 
your fax number so I can fax this document to you.

Kind regards
Michelle
