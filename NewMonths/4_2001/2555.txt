Jill,

Bob Walker has informed me that Pioneer has requested the existing GISB with 
ENA be assigned to ENA Upstream.  The GISB at issue was acquired from 
Columbia Energy Services.   In light of this there would be no need for a new 
GISB with Pioneer.  

To date,  Pioneer is holding final version of  our GISB.
