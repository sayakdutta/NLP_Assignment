Dear Mr. Thornton,

We are in receipt of your letter to Jeff Skilling dated March 30, 2001.  Jeff 
has been traveling for the past 2 weeks; however, I wanted you to know that 
your letter was received and that you will receive a response as soon as 
practical.

In the meantime, please feel free to contact me if I may be of further 
assistance.
