Michael Brown,

Do you have the standard offer service agreement?  It isn't in Stuart's file, 
and it is referenced as being entered into at the same time as the PPSA.  We 
need to see how these two agreements fit together.  

Has NIMO given the bidders access to the contracts listed in the schedules?  
We especially need to see the ones that they can assign to Enron (PSEG and 
NRG). 

Given the size of the transaction I think we should have Klauberg (or another 
New York lawyer) take a look at it. It is an interesting deal.

Currently trying to corridinate this potential transaction relatively 
quickly, given the fact the bid is due on May 8th.  What is the next steps 
for you in this deal, & what can I expect in the next few days.
