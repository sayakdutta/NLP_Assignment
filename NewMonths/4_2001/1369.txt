Sunil,

I just checked my messages this morning....I didn't think people could leave messages anymore after I was put on a trading phone but low and behold they can.  If you ever want to get a hold of me in the future, the best bets are email and cell phone (713-775-6472).

I'd be happy to chat with you if you still need to.  Just let me know a time and place and I'm there.

Susan
