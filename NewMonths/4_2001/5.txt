Dana,

It is very nice to hear from you. You are in Dallas, right? How is your family?

Well ...  yes I am living in Houston again. I still work for Enron ... I just returned from a business trip to the Middle East and India ... it was interesting but too long.

Guess what ... I got married on March 17th. Guess to whom ... Renee Freyou from Port Neches. Can you believe it!!!

You can call me toll free at my office  1-800-973-6766,  Press 1 to transfer to an extension, Press 55855 for my extension.

It will be great to talk to you. I hope that you are doing very well.

Hi Paul.  I received your message earlier this year and accidentally erased it.  When I called information to get your number, a really young woman (twenty-something) answered the phone number I was given....  She told me I had the wrong number but I'm still wondering...  Anyway, hopefully you'll receive this and reply with your current home number.  Are you still in Puerto Rico?  You'll have to tell me about your experience there.  Let me know if you receive this and I'll write back...  Talk to you soon...
 
Dana
