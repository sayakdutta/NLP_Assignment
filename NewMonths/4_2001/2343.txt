Attached are the contracts for the Kennedy and Quantum excess gas purchase.  
The confirms will be signed by the parties and governed by the GTC.  The 
attached GTC is the same for both confirms.  Note the Exhibit A to each 
confirm is not attached.  I will simply take the well listing Exhibit's from 
the existing long term contracts to create these new exhibits.
