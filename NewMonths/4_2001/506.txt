great - here is brochure.  I will try to get list of attendees so we can see 
who is going; usually in east, crowd is primarially legal and credit; WSPP 
meetings in west however generally have more commercial ... so I don't know 
if Stuart would benefit or not but I would love for him to come if he wants.  
Talk to you soon.

Registration is still available for our upcoming workshop on the EEI and WSPP 
standard master contracts.  Unfortunately, rooms at the Four Seasons have 
sold out...We can arrange a block of rooms at a special rate in a nearby 
hotel,  however, we need to know  soon how large a block to guarantee.  
Please let me know if you or anyone from your company is planning to attend 
this conference.  We have an outstanding program planned and our brochure 
(PDF-ADOBE) is attached.  The brochure contains a registration form that 
should be faxed to me at 202/508-5673.  We are looking forward to seeing all 
of you in California.
