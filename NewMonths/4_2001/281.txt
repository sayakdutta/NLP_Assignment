I haven't heard anything back. I spoke with Willie on the phone Friday 
afternoon, and he said the best way to get this done quickly would be to send 
out an e-mail. I was actually just about to call and check on the request, 
but if you have a moment, could you find out where it's at in the chain of 
commmand?

Thanks,
Kate

Please add to this a request for the Dow Jones COB Sunday Index price. 
Thanks.

The West traders have requested a new pub posting code to allow them to do 
deals against the Dow Jones Palo Verde Sunday index. In particular, Matt 
Motley, our Long Term Southwest trader, has executed a deal today for Cal'01 
through Cal'06 at the Palo Verde index price. It runs all days and all hours, 
so we need to enter three legs - one at the on peak price, one at off peak, 
and one at Sunday price. The 24-hour Sunday price is the only option missing 
from EnPower. Matt has asked that we get this pub code in as soon as possible 
so his deal can be entered and calced tonight. Please let me know what you 
can do.

Thanks,
Kate Symes
