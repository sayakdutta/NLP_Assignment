I had no idea about Roger. Where is he going? I'll expand the list to include 
your suggestions.

Roger Ondreko left the company (or is leaving soon).  Herman brought Billy 
Flemmin (sp?) yesterday, and Billy seems to be involved in a bunch of stuff.

Your tax guys are Matt Gockerman (state) and Rhett Jackson (federal).

Anybody else I need to make peace with that should be on the list?

It's high time we had some fun around here! 

Please set up a dinner for Wednesday, April 18 or Thursday April 19 at Papa's

and Glenn), as well as:

Dave Duran
Kay Mann
Carlos Sole
Ann Elizabeth White
Jeff Hodge
Barbara Gray
Sheila Tweed
Stuart Zisman
Lisa Bills
Joe Deffner
Catherine Clark
Roseann Engeldorf

Please discuss the invitee list with Fred to determine if anybody should be 
added.

Please get a preliminary head count, and contact Papa's to determine if and 
when they can accommodate us. We can talk tomorrow about this.

Thanks,

Ben
