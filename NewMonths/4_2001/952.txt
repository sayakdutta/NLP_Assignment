     It is time once again to let me know how much time you spent on East 
Coast Power.
 
 
Mary Perkins - could you please forward the number of transactions and 
accounts.

Jason Chumley, Tai Nguyen and Sean Sargent - could you please forward the 
number of contractor hours and remote support hours.

It is important that we get this information ASAP so we can bill East Coast 
Power for your time.

Thanks,

Susan Rance
