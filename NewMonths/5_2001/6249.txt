Hi Sara and Stephanie,

 It is my understanding that the paralegals working on the brokerage accounts 
are to (1) send documents to counterparties; (2) track their return and (3) 
keep the fully executed documents received from counterparties in the file 
cabinet next to Stephanie's office.

 In light of our being short-staffed in light of Samantha's absence, I have 
tried to be helpful to our team by assisting in preparing the documents for 
execution & getting some signatures.  I hope that has been helpful.  But once 
Stephanie [or whichever legal assistant assumes her role] notes that the 
documents have gone out, then that person should track the documents and be 
the keeper of records.
