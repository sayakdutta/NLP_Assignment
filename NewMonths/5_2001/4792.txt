I didn't talk to Jason on this one.  I'll check w/ Mark, but I doubt he would 
know what we gave to Hertzberg and the chamber.  It's odd that Jason said 
Enron "executive" since if he talks to me or Mark, he uses "spokesman" or 
uses our names... I think Davis's new hit men are really trying to paint us 
as the evil empire...
