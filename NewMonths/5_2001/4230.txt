Yes, E-Next.  You might advise Jeff that we will probably need a substitute 
LOC post-assignment.

Kay,

Is E-Next Generation LLC the correct entity as beneficiary?

Chris

 



Chris,

The bank will issue the LOC by the end of next week, perhaps as early as
Wednesday.  We are using E-Next Generation LLC as the beneficiary.  The LOC
will be mailed to you.  Do you still require a Lien Waiver?

Also, do you want new invoices?  If so, will one for $1,502,355 be
sufficient?

Regards,

Jeff





Jeff,

Can you give me an update on where GE stands on providing the Letter of
Credit as discussed in my letter of 21 May 2001.
Regards,

   Chris,

   I will get you re-established on PNet, with the correct e-mail address..
   For the B&V folks, I need names, e-mail addresses, and phone numbers,
   (nice,
   but not required).

   Just a reminder, the site change process can not start until the new
   site
   conditions are identified to GE.  The cost and cycle estimate then takes
   about 4 weeks.

   Regards,
