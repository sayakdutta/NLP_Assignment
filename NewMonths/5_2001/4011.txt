No, I believe it is one of TECO's subs, but I'm not sure.

Thanks, Kay.  Is Frontera an Enron subsidiary?

Steve/Christian,

The attached file is a draft of an asset management agreement prepared by Stu 
Zisman.  The later version obviously contained more negotiated points, so I 
think this one is more helpful.

I'm working on a transaction now which involves serving load as well as 
selling power. I found this one helpful for issue identification and 
exculpatory language, however.
