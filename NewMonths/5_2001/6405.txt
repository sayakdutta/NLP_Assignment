Above company has approached us re an ISDA with them, they have also told us 
that they have been negotiating ISDAs with Enron London and Enron Singapore 
for some time.

**************

Laurie/Nony,

I wonder if you can find out for me from the data base, what the status is 
with Mitsui Corp. ISDAs re all Enron companies?  

***************

Alan,

Mitsui Corp has hinted that it doesn't want to have separate ISDAs with 
separate Enron entities.  What is Enron's usual approach to this I wonder.  
Seems to me that from the customer's perspective, this makes sense.  I wonder 
what sort of internal issues this raises though.

**********************

Thanks all.

Jane
