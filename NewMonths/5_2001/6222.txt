Tracy:  Thanks!!!!!  (and I'll call Yair in a day or so if I haven't heard 
from him)

New Question:  Will you be handling credit for the Washington Public Utility 
Districts (Benton, Franklin and Grays Harbor)?  I spoke with Jeff Fuller 
(PRM) and a lawyer for the PUDs yesterday and I'm analyzing the authority 
issue.

Sara,

Spoke with Tom Moore this morning regarding the last outstanding issue 
(assignment clause for cp) and he is on board with my methodology and agrees 
as well.  He and Yair will propose to Enron replacement language to get us 
where we need to be hopefully.

Tracy

 

Tracy:

Did you and Yair finalize the "transfer" language?  It seems that too many 
confirm questions are popping up and different forms are being drafted.  We 
;should be done with the ISDA.
