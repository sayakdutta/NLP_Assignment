Ms. St. Clair:

I am the Director of Insurance Risk Management at Reliant and Janet Greene
asked me to set up a conference call and/or meeting with you to answer any
questions that you and your credit people may have about our proposal to
utilize surety bonds as collateral with ENRON.  If you will send me a
couple of dates and times for  the week of May 21 Re when you are
available, I will arrange to have representatives from Aon, the broker for
Reliant who is also  the issuing agent for the sureties in this matter,
available for discussion with you and your people, either for a conference
call or in a meeting at ENRON, if you prefer.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Thankyou,

Bill Oldham
