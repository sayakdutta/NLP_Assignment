Oops - I didn't notice that your first message this morning went to Linda & 
Amanda also.  I guess we'd better bring a pair of long pants.

That is because amanda picked The Crab Hole in Little Dix on our last trip I 
can guaranty you that I picking the Rock Resort this time!





I was thinking of not packing long pants in favor of a shorts/bathing suit
only vacation.  Do you think I will need dressier attire for a restaurant or
is it "all casual all the time" down there.  Amanda said the restaurants are
converted shacks and shorts will be fine.  I just wanted to double check.
