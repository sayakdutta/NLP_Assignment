Well, actually I see it as finally finding someone that could appreciate those ideosyncracies and recognizing them as the gems they are. Ha Ha!!

I'm involved in Enron's LNG business. My focus is fuel management for two power projects - EcoElectrica (Puerto Rico) and Dabhol (India). India is nothing but problems as you may have heard. 

Great to hear from you and know you are alive and well.

Stay in Touch,

Paul

Great to hear back.  Jenny and I have just returned from a short trip to
Beijing, where we were antique shopping and eating great Chinese food.

Life in Hong Kong is fast paced and revolves around work.  I travel
throughout the region making private equity investments.  Weekends are a
time to catch up on sleep.  Pretty boring stuff.

I was very happy to hear that you have settled down.   Glad to see that you
have found someone who can put up with your ideosyncracies (I am kidding,
of course).

What are you doing at Enron?

Best,
Edan

Edan,

Thanks!!!! I didn't realize that you were still in Hong Kong. How's life???
Are you married? I can't remember.

Married life is good. Different but good.
