Shalesh,

A good idea.  I shall forward it to the AG traders.

Nelson,

I know you are focusing on agricultural products for trading, so I just wanted to know if we are looking at Wool.  I know that it's traded in Australia and New Zealand, so we might be able to look into it as well.  Please let me know.  Thank you.
