We have received inquiries from several attorneys who attended only the 
Thursday session of the Enron Corp. Law Conference in San Antonio.  If you 
have not already contacted someone about CLE credit for Thursday,  please 
send an e-mail to Becky Zikes stating that you attended the Thursday 
session.  This will enable you to claim 3.50 hours total credit, with 1.25 
hours ethics credit for Thursday.  If you have any questions, please contact 
Becky Zikes at 3-1843, or Diane Goode at 5-7103.   Please respond by 
Thursday, May 31 since we need to finalize our CLE filings with the various 
state bar organizations. 


If you wish to receive CPE credit (for certified public accountants) for the 
Law Conference, please  send an e-mail to Becky Zikes and we will get the 
appropriate certificate prepared.  Again, any questions should be directed to 
Becky Zikes at 3-1843, or Diane Goode at 5-7103. 

Thanks for your help.
