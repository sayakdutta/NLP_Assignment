Bill and Tanya:

I am resending this memo to you in light of what I understand is a 3-year 
deal that Craig Breslau has done with MARTA (Metropolitan Area Rapid Transit 
Authority).  I need to advise Mark Haedicke of the details as soon as 
possible since MARTA is a public entity and we do not have an executed Master 
Agreement with MARTA.  We sent a draft document to MARTA on May 11, 2001.  
Until we resolve the "capacity" or "authority" issue, there is significant 
legal risk attached to transactions with governmental entities.

I left a message for Jay Williams to please advise me of trade details.

Bill:  The attached memo was distributed to legal last week.  We have had a 
number of questions arise on the power side lately regarding financial 
transactions (ranging from short term to quarterly) with governmentals.  As 
you will see in the memo, the risks are significant.  Please let me know if 
you have any questions.  Sara
