Andrew:

Thanks for the email.

I now have my facts straight.  The account is currently in the name of "ECT 
Investments, Inc." (and not Enron North America Corp.).  The specific ECT 
Investments, Inc. account at Morgan Stanley that is being transferred is:  
038-08826-6 (which is the credit book).

I thought you would want to modify the assignment agreement since it is your 
agreement.  I also wanted to be certain that the Annex A description is 
sufficient for you.  

Please call if you have any questions.  Thanks.
