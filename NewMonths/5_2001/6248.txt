Paul:

I need to speak with you about the foregoing.

(1)  Re:  the Chase Global Custody Agreemnet

Are you OK with Chase's ability to setoff amounts in any ENA Chase accounts 
against amount which ENA may owe under the Global Custody Agreement?  Does 
ENA have many accounts with Chase?

(2)  Re:  Enron Credit Inc. repo agreement with Goldman Sachs & Co. ("GSC")

By way of background, ECT executed a repo with GSC on 4/25/97.
FYI, Enron Corp. issued a guaranty in the amount of $10 million.

Do you have any concerns with respect to a repo agreement between GSC and 
Enron Credit Inc.?

If possible, could we speak today?  Thanks.
