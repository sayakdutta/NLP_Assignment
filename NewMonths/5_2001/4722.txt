FYI: Attached is a letter from Senator Brulte and Assembly Member Cox to the
Governor in response to his signing yesterday of SB 28x (Sher), which makes
several IEP-sponsored changes to the CEC siting process.  Brulte/Cox outline
in this letter the next steps they believe should be taken to streamline the
siting process and propose other fixes to getting more generation on-line.
