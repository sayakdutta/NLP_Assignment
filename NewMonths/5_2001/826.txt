No problem. I hope the results are OK.

I have my 6 month eye appointment on Monday, June 25, 2001, at 1:30 PM.  I have to go in every 6 months because of my diabetes.  It will take most of the afternoon because they will have to dilate my eyes and possibly do a Field of Vision test.   Let me know if this is OK.  Thanks.  Anita
