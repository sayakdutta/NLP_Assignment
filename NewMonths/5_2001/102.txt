Matt,

Doug Leach will be calling me in the morning to set up a brief meeting to discuss all the final details regarding purchase of the fuel oil for Ft. Pierce.  I believe that we have all the logistical matters addressed and all that is left to discuss is where and how exactly the charges for this purchase will flow.   

In order to maximize communication and be sure that this issue is finally resolved, I am asking that you attend this meeting with us tomorrow morning.  Please let me know what your availability is.


Thanks!

Charlie
