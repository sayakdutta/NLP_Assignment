Elizabeth:  Good to hear from you.  David Anderson is immersed in the
agreement, and he should be the one youwork with on it (415-973-6659;

stand-still agreement, which, as I last understood it, had only one
remaining issue, namely, the wording of the drawing provision for the LCs.
Can we get that one behind us, also?  Thanks.  Larry





Hi Larry


I spoke with Peter Keohane and Mark Powell from our Canadian office and
they would be available at any time today, Tues the 8th , to go over the
Canadian Gas Master between ECC and PG&E.  Let me know what time works for
you.

Thanks
