Jimmy,

Shubh Shrivastava suggested that I contact you regarding getting on the distribution list for news articles relating to the DPC project. I work for Wayne Perry in Houston in the LNG group. We will be performing the services under the Fuel Management Agreement. I am, of course, very interested in reading what the Indian press is printing about the current state of the project.

Thanks,

Paul
