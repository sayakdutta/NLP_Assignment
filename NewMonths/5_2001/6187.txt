Kristina:

I'm sorry too!
However, I also sent your application through Houston and it may end up with 
a different group.  I'll keep my fingers crossed (not just for Enron) because 
I know you'll find an exciting position with a good company.
Hope all is well.  I just returned from a week in California and I'm having a 
hard time adjusting to the office.
Regards.

Hi Sara:
Thanks for trying but appears as if they were looking for a technical
trading person to participate in the associates and analysts program...too
bad. I thought perhaps ebusiness or the like would have been fun.
I'll keep you posted on any future news from them.
Kindest Regards,
Kristina
