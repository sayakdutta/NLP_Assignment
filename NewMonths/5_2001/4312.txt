I just like to make Margie work.

So do you think they'll fire Dierker?  I guess you heard Lima is heading to 
the bullpen.







Will do.  For the moment, the only document that is outstanding is the joint
letter instruction to Citibank regarding the disbursement of the escrow
funds.  I have a template, but I'll go ahead and let them take the lead.

Checklist



If there are any other resolutions, etc that they want, I would let them
prepare them.

Thanks a bunch,

Kay
