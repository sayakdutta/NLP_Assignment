If  California businesses are to have any chance to avoid being forced to 
endure  unbelievable rate increases under the CPUC plan, they must have 
direct  access.? Subcommittee Chairman Barton has told us he supports DA, and 
we  have several California congressmen considering introducing the DA 
amendment at  this Friday's full committee markup.? Please contact ALL 
members that you  can.? Mr. Radanovich, Mr. Ose, Mr. Lewis, Mr. Cox and Mr. 
Shadegg(Arizona)  have all expressed positive interest, but none has given 
the firm committment  necessary to introduce the amendment.? Use the 
telephone, the fax, e-mail,  and any other method you can to convince the 
members to push hard for DA in H.R.  1647.
?
Contact me with any questions.
