Mike,

The maximum ash content is 0.01 wt% on the official spec for low-sulfur #2 fuel oil that we would be ordering.  We should plan on receiving fuel oil with up to this amount as you mention.


Thanks,

Charlie

Can you tell me what the lowest reasonable ash content readily available is?  We will submit the lowest reasonably attainable spec to MHI and ask them to assure that they will meet the PM10 requirements.

Thanks!

Mike
