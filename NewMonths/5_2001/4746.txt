I'd blow it off.  Your batting 0.9999999999.  In anybody's book, that's 
phenomenal.  Don't look back.  And PR, under the circumstances, is doing a 
stellar job overall.  Vacation was nice.  Thanks.  Bad thing is it made me 
realize how much more of it I need (and likely ain't gonna get soon).

Best,
Jeff

		 		 		 MEETING: Chairman pitches his plan to prominent Californians

That's what I told AP, but after I looked like a major doofus on the front 
page of the Chronicle... The last few weeks have not been pretty for PR...  
How was your vacation?

MEETING: Chairman pitches his plan to prominent Californians  

Seems to have Riordan written all over it.  I say "no big deal."  We're 
talking to everyone.  No secrecy involved.  We'll keep talking, being 
constructive and trying to help develop solutions that work for CA.   Your 
thoughts?
