Nancy Rivera-Brooks of the LA Times just called.  Said she'd heard that Ken 
Lay and Governor are in frequent talks discussing the possibility of Enron 
buying Edison's transmission system.  I told her that Enron is not in the 
market for transmission systems.  Next thing you know, we'll want to buy the 
nukes.

Best,
Jeff
