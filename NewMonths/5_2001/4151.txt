Hi Stuart,

I believe the plant manager was going to call someone at SW, to keep the 
communication lines open.  I'll be glad to draft a friendly letter to follow 
up.

Kay,

I am not sure what we decided on Friday.  Are we going to send another (more 
friendly) letter to the Westinghouse people evidencing a willingness to 
discuss the draw issue?  Please let me know at your convenience.

Stuart
