Hi Debra,

Have you had any word back from credit regarding the Exposure Thresholds?
When last we spoke, Enron wanted Duke to be reduced to $1M regarding Early
Termination Damages due to current exposure rates.  Our credit department
came back and said the Enron's exposure to Duke was such that they would
then want to see an equal reduction in Enron's Early Termination Damges
amount.

Basically, our credit department has asked that these amounts be reciprocal
in nature as we have a situation where our exposure to one another is
almost equal.

Please let me know what they say.

Robin
