Doug -

Here are my comments.  Really only made one in relation to the E-rating.  
Want to make sure that reliance upon this rating scale/system is at Blue Sox 
own risk.




Have a good weekend.

I've modified the document that you sent me to reflect the latest updates 
(meeting document.)  Please review this doc.  My changes are in red;  yours 
are still in blue.  Please make any changes, and then I'll accept them and 
create the final doc.  

thanks

Doug -

Below are my initial comments to the Blue Sox information.  I have some 
additional points to make and will provide those in a separate document.  The 
document attached is based upon the latest memo you forwarded; however, it 
must be a version prior to the one you provided at the meeting as there are 
some provisions in the meeting form that are not in the attached.

Call me if you want to discuss any comments.
