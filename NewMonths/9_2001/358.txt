I recommend that we don't actually book anything for a while, but let's look at weather and tentatively be thinking of a date.  As far as the bombing, that will go on for years.  K.

By the way, thank you so much for your help today on the terminations of OBA's!  

Kim.

 

	Do we want to see what happens when we start bombing before we pick a date?

 

Hey gang,

I just wanted you to know that I sent a fax early this week to cancel our hotel in Positano (Hotel Marincanto).  I did not receive a confirmation back from them, so I called them this morning.  Julio is the gentleman I talked to and he did inform me that the four rooms we had booked are cancelled.  I think we are OK, but I would feel better if we had written confirmation of the cancellation.  Please watch your credit card charges to ensure that you do not get billed for the hotel.

I have received written confirmation from the hotel in Rome (front end of trip) and the hotel in Florence of our cancellation.

Let's start looking at dates in 2002 to rebook this trip.  If one of you has some time, would you check to see if the weather would be better in May or June? Any thoughts? 

Thanks, Kim.
