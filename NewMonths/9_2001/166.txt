Quick overdue update...

The meeting on the Belmont County - Ormet project that I arranged with the coal office and related agencies went very well.  Enron's coal plant development group is preparing an application and we will be exploring with the Ohio Air Quality Dev't Authority both traditional and creative new financing structures.  I will be arranging a follow-up meeting in a few weeks.  If this goes well, we could develop other projects in Ohio.

I will keep you posted.
