Ann Bike and Elizabeth Hernandez were suppose to handle the booking of this deal.  It is a real deal.  ENA is paying a 5 cent demand charge on 310000 for the opton to park gas in March and take out in August/.  Please contact Ann Bike for the sitara dealnumber.

 

Jane, Cal Hub has invoiced ENA $15,500.00 for August 2001.  However, I do not show anything in our system.  Do you know if this is valid and if so, do you know the Sitara number?  Thanks.
