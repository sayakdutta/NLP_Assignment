Holly,
I think you have the wrong Bill Williams. I am in Portland and am not involved with card access.
Thanks,
Bill




Ronnie Bagley's access card has died.  Can you replace card number 29776 with card number 37586.  I have issued card and he still needs access to the EB.
Thanks.


The most ability is responsibility.  Nothing happens until someone steps forward and says, "You can count on me."
