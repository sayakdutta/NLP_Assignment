Call Thane Twiggs.  I'd also be interested in seeing this through - there was a little confusion about Enron's position earlier but we are now ok.

Hi Mark, 
I'm working on a story about the ancillary services market in ERCOT and changes recommended by the PUC and a consultant to ERCOT. I came across the following statement in documents in PUC docket 23220.

Enron: "Enron believes the proposed ERCOT protocols are unlikely to deliver market outcomes envisioned by Senate Bill 7 and has recommended that the commission analyze the benefits that can be expected compared to a market design such as in PJM."


Who can I talk to briefly about changes that Enron would like to see in the ERCOT operated ancillary and balancing energy markets?

Thanks, 
Ann de Rouffignac
