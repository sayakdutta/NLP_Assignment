Sorry to mess you around on this but we have now booked the flights and we do not need the extra night - is it ok to cancel the extra night.  If possible could you please send a new confirm when you have time.

Thanks

Louise

 

I will check on the extra night and let you know.  I am in receipt of your
deposit check and am holding it pending closing of the property tomorrow.  I
will send you a confirmation next week reflecting the payment and the extra
night if it is available.
