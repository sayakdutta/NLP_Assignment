FYI, Kim.



Obviously we have called all our day-to-day contacts about the ongoing Inte=
rnet situation.  I believe that we have been able to accomodate all nominat=
ions, even if by fax.  Since this is going on for the second day, I thought=
 you may want to give a heads up to your marketing contacts.  If you hear o=
f other companies that are having similar problems please let me know.
