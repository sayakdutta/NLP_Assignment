i am not sure if i am moving or not.   i wont know until the beginning of the year.  i am back and forth on the decision.  i am glad your sis is ok.  i did get a room for 160.  i am sure i will split it with some of those guys.

 


Hey there....thanks for your concern for my friends & family after the
tragedy...everyone is okay, thank G-d...how about your friends?  I have one
sister in DC & one in NYC, so it was a pretty traumatic week, but everyone
is okay & that is what's important.  Alli (my sis in NYC) happened to be at
a meeting on Wall Street that morning, so she was 2 blocks away & was
covered in debris running from the building, so she will probably need
therapy like the rest of Manhattan!

On a happier note...thanks for forwarding that email to the ushers...did
you get the $160 rate with our block of rooms when you reserved your room?
As far as the tux goes..when we go to Miami in October to finalize
everything, Max will send the guys the form for the tuxes to return your
measurements to the place in Miami & you guys will go get fitted & pick
them up on Thurs. afternoon or Fri. morning before the wedding....I dont
know what Max has planned for you guys on Friday...who are you sharing a
room with?  :)  Stacey is probably going stag....just kidding....

We went to a wedding this weekend & watched the best man make a speech &
Max & I just cracked up because all we could do was picture your speech!  I
have faith that you'll deliver a beautiful speech, right????

Hope all is well there...when are you moving here to collect your
"wingman"?

Take care,
Jen
The Bride :)
