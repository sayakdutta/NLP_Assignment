I have pathed this deal in Path Manager and balanced.  There is still 43,559 then leftover unaccounted for on the trades, correct?

 

Marlo,

The buy back tkt for EES has been put in for a volume of 276,441 for the July imbalance. The deal #  is 1038688. Please let me know if there are any problems with July.

Thanks,
Patti

The imbalance trade for July 2001 is deal #1020741 and is to Southern California Gas Company for 320,000 mmbtu.  So. Cal. is saying they are only aware of a trade for August for 320,000 which matched deal #1019969 that is on the spreadsheet.  Did these 2 deals get put in correctly?

Please let me know.

Thanks,
Marlo James
