I sent this report to John and Louise last week.  Intend to make it monthly.  Similar to earlier.  I will include you on it going forward.  Sent to John's asst.  Call with any questions.

Jim, 
I know you guys have been busy beyond belief so I haven't had the heart to contact you about the report.  However, Louise is anxious to put a process back in place for the Office of the Chair update book.  

Would you kindly let me know if you could pull one together in the near future and what the frequency ought to be (monthly/bi-monthly)?

Thank you, 
Tammy
