Jeff, can you set this up, you can coordinate with my admin, Sharon.

Sounds good. Just let me know if you'd like to set up the call, or if you'd like me to do it.

 

Best,

Jeff

We must go after this. I need some specific direction with exactly what you would like us to have our clients do. I see this as breaking our market down into the following as each are effected a bit differently:

- a specific alignment with the contracts we signed in August

- those clients we are marketing to, and can't sign a new contract due to the suspension

- existing clients whom we are risk with if there are ANY restrictions on extensions

Suggest that we set-up a call on Mon or Tues. Would like myself, Angela Schwarz, Lamar Frazier, David Cox, Gayle Muench and Michael Mann in attendance
