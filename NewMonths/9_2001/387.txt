I'll forward to Phillip also,  someone in his group may have a Confirm sheet with the details on it.

 

Mark:
I am starting to make my way through the Consumers balances and I have some February issues that I thought you may be able to help me with.  We have sale deal 618840 which is for Consumers contract 5040-82-42.  It looks like the deal is priced correctly, but Consumers also invoiced us for a demand fee that we don't have.  It was for 500,00 at $0.0175.  They show it as a take or pay deal.  Do you have this confirmation or can you tell me if we have this deal booked right?  I also have several other deals that look like receivables for Enron, but they've never been paid.  They are 244662, 636507, 636515 and 387756.   Should we have billed Consumers?  I don't have any Consumers the confirms for Feb, so I can't check the deals.
