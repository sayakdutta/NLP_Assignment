Jill,

I need information regarding our monthly cell phone costs. I would like to cap per employee costs at $50 per month on the group calling plan. Effective in October, I would like employees billed for any amount they have over $50 per month on their cell phone. If an employee needs more minutes I would like to structure a plan to allow them to purchase more minutes through us--with them paying the extra per month.

Thanks,
Bill
