Thanks.  BTW, I don't show you as logged into MSN messenger.  K.




Sure, I'll take care of it...




I've got an 8:30 meeting at the office.  I can do later in the morning
or afternoon.  Can you take him alone? K.




We have an 8 a.m. appointment tomorrow (Tuesday) morning with Tracey
McAdoo.
Can you and I both go?  I had the option of leaving him there tonight
for a
tomorrow exam, but I didn't want to stress him out any more than
necessary....  JW




Please call the vet to see about a late monday appt.  Try to get Tracey
McAdoo if possible.  I could also do a late tuesday appt. if monday
doesn't
work.  ILY, K.
