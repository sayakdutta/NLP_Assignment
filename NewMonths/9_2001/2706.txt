Ross,

Look forward to meeting you on Monday.

I shall be on the campus between 10:15 - 10:30
on Monday. I am meeting Ehud Ronn and a group of Business
School professors for lunch at noon. What about a meeting between 10:30 and 11:30?
I can come directly to your office.


Vince

 

Dear Vince,
	I wanted to follow-up with you about your visit to
UT that I understand is scheduled for September 10.
If convenient, I would very much like to meet you
sometime during that day.
	Regards,
		Ross
