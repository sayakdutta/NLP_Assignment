Yes...that is correct.

 

I'm going to assume that was just a disgusting way of saying, "Sure thing, Kate. Do what you need to do."

 

NO!!!! You must live with gross tooth decay and bleeding gums. Yellow teeth and excessive plaque build-up are expected in Real-Time...

 

Bill -

If it works out for you, I'm going to leave today for about an hour and a half for a dentist's appointment. I'll be gone from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. Please let me know if this presents a problem for what we're trying to accomplish today.
