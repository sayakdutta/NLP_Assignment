I've just been informed that I'm being switched to Outlook tonite, which 
means, I've been told, that I may not have access to my email later this 
evening.  If that holds, I'll email the draft to everyone first thing in the 
morning (hopefully by 8 AM Houston) time.  Otherwise, it'll land in your 
email later tonite.  My apologies for all the machinations.

Best,
Jeff
