Here is the link for the load data on the CA ISO's web site.  Although the 
ISO has some time limit on keeping data, it goes back at least as far as Jan 
'01.  We didn't check any earlier.  Feel free to call with any questions.

Sue,

From this link: http://oasis.caiso.com/ the information your are looking for 
can be obtained.  Once the CA ISO OASIS homepage comes up, click on the 
"System Load" tab in the upper righthand corner, this will bring you to the 
"System Load Reports" page.  From this page you can query the ISO's database. 
 From trying to query the data, I have found out that you can request no more 
than 31 days of data at a time.

Hope this helps, any questions, just let me know.

Kind Regards,

Dave
