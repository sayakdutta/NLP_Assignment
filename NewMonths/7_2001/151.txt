Lou,

Sorry I am just now getting back to you but I have been on vacation.  Anyway, the answer to your questions is $.70 today.  That number can change with the market though.  Keep me posted on any potential gas transactions you have going on and let me know if you need any price indications.

Thanks,

Kim

 


Kim:
    I appreciate  receiving the pricing updates from you last week for 5 yr. and 3 yr. gas  strips.  Henwood is working for several generation clients doing  gas/electric consulting, so I'll probably be contacting you again for an  indicative price, or you might receive an RFP for gas that we're helping a QF  write.
  
    One question that  I have now is, do you have an idea on what the premium would be for a 5 yr. gas  supply that was 5x13 or 5x16 rather than a base-load 7x24 at the PG&E  Citygate?   Thanks, Kim.
