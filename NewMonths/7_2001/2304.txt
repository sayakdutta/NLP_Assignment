Krishna,

Who can review Rusty? I think he deserves an offer.

Summer is quickly drawing to a close for our summer interns.  

We have scheduled several departure dates for the interns.  Our records indicate that your summer intern, Russell W. Parks III, is scheduled to return to school on 8/9/01.  

We would like to host a performance review session for all interns who are departing during this same week.  

The review session for your intern will be held on August 2nd at 10:00 am to 11:30 am in EB 35C2.  Please bring the completed performance feedback form for your intern to this meeting along with any other feedback from your team members that you may have collected. 

We will discuss each intern, cross calibrate their individual performances and decide which interns will receive full time offers.

If you are unable to attend this meeting, please contact me at X33242.

Sincerely,

Traci Warner
Director
A/A Recruiting
