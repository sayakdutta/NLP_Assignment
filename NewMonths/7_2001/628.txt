Sounds good.  If you need anything from me, let me know.

 

Kevin,

I sent an email to John asking him for some time tomorrow to discuss my concerns re: my transition to power in the latter part of the year.  After I talk to him, I will call or email you with my decision.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks.
