H. & C. were suppose to get back from Hawaii on Saturday.  H had to leave on Sunday for Maine but was suppose to return last night or today.  I don't have Mrs. Mauney's number but I think my mom has it if you want to call her - 901-396-0399.  Still trying to figure out this weekend.  I would love to play golf instead of go to that dumb picnic.  One problem is that I pulled the daylights out of my left hamstring and it is affecting my game.  I will keep you posted.

Kim,

Do you know when H and Chase are do back?? Do you have Mrs. Mauney's phone
number? Mr. Mauney's IRS tax credit check came to the house and I need to
get it to them somehow

Thanks
