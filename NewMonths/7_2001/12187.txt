its a WP doc.   so detach and save first.  then open from the folder where 
you saved it.  word will then convert it from wp to word and let you open 
it.  if you have problems, let me know.

best,
jeff

I can't open it.  Didn't you tell me last week there was some trick to 
getting these documents open?

 

wow.  ok.  that works with me.  you read the new, amended complaint?  pretty 
tough stuff, which is the only option they've left us....






Meeting will be on Wednesday.  Still compiling everyone's schedule -- did you 
know Steve was on vacation this week?

 

we have  time yet for tomorrow's meeting re: contempt stuff?
