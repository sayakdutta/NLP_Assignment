well, i'm sorry it's been cancelled.  would have been fun.  i'm going to go 
anyway---get my review from paul and talk to the folks up there.  can we do 
the call at 10 am PDT?  

best,
jeff

I sort of invited myself along (at Sue's invitation).  Still haven't seen the 
Western trading floor, haven't met Tim Belden, etc.  Besides, it made sense 
to be up to speed on the issues.  I should have figured you should have been 
on the list.  are we having fun yet??

 

were you going, too?  i hadn't heard a damned thing.  steffes just informed 
me.
