Quick add on to Sue's note:

Right now, appears they're focused on the budget, but could take up energy.  
There appears to continue to be considerable uncertainty----seems that even 
many Democratic Assembly members don't know at this point what the plan is 
for this afternoon/evening. Our lobbyists are attempting to get more info, 
which we'll pass on soon as we get it.

Best,
Jeff
