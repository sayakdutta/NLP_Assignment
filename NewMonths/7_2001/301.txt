Dear Participants:

I'm writing to provide you with an update on our progress to launch the
Automated Dispatch and Messaging System, or 'ADaMS' for short. In my May 25
note I outlined the efficiency benefits of the new system, and attached a
copy of our tentative implementation schedule.

Since then, we've been busy testing the product to make sure it meets the
Power Pool's standards for quality, and the expectations of our
participants. And to be frank, at this point in time it doesn't quite
measure up. We feel we'd be jeopardizing the quality of the product to meet
the timeline. And that's not the way we do business. Instead, we've decided
to shift the launch to early September 2001. The change will also provide
additional time for participants to prepare, especially during the summer
holiday season, and allow for more one-on-one training with individual
participants as requested.

Our technical staff will be contacting you in July, to ensure you can
connect to the system and receive test dispatches.  Also, we will contact
you with a firmer implementation schedule as we approach September.

In the meantime, if you have any questions please feel free to contact
either myself at (403) 233-6491, or your respective Participant Liaison
listed below.

Company Name:   A-E  Elizabeth Vergara (403) 233-6405


				F-Z  Karen Mazuryk (403) 705-8509


Thank you for your cooperation.

Sincerely,
POWER POOL OF ALBERTA
