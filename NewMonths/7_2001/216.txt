Hi Ken

In accordance with Lisa's call to you, here are revised drafts of the Modification Agreement and LC for your review.  By copy of this email I am at the same time circulating the documents for review by others at Enron. I apologize in advance for not sending a blackline (a glitch here prevented me from making final changes in blackline) - if you are unable to make a marked copy from your prior version, let me know and I will attempt Tuesday morning to send you one. Thanks again for your help in getting this finalized.

  
 



Lisa, as we discussed, here is a revised version of the letter of credit.
