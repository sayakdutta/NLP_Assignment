Thanks Pat.  

Do you know who will be in the audience?  And how many folks we are 
expecting?  Also, if there are specific things that you folks want/don't want 
me to say, please let me know.

Best,
Jeff

The Enron-sponsored briefing on energy policy will be from 5-6:30 pm in the 
Booth Room on the 5th floor of the Marriott Marquis on Friday, August 3.  Our 
presentation will be done by Jeff Dasovich.  Grover Norquist and Americans 
for Tax Reform will be carrying out all logistics.  

There should be time for the presentation, questions, and discussion.

Best,

Pat
