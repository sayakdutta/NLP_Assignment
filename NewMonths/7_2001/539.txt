Who called it a new business?

 


Berney -

I would have Jim Wood attend as well while we are at it.  Bernstein's group needs to go through all of the channels a marketing deal goes through such as Product Development/Underwriting, etc.
  
I am still wondering though how supply purchases fits in with "New Businesses".

Berney,

Good idea. I suggest we also invite Sean Holmes as one of the things we should discuss is how we price the backlog of deals in the pipeline given everyone's limited resources. 

thanks,
