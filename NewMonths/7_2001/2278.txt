Rakesh,

I don't think I have to be involved.

Hi Vince,

I just received a call from Scot Gallagher at Arthur Anderson. They are seeking some clarifcations about how we formed the portfolios of puts and what volatility was used.  They would like to do a conference call.  Apparently, this is not a senior level issue.  Please advise if you would like to attend. Thanks.
