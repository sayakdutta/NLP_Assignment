Kourtney,
Just a quick heads up for the flash.
Path 26 was derated last night for HE 19 through HE 24.  For HE 24 the price for congestion revenue was $247.98.  We were awarded 218 mws of congestion relief by the CAISO.  This should equal $54059.64 in congestion revenue to ECTRT. 
If you have any questions, please let me know.

Thanks,
Bill
