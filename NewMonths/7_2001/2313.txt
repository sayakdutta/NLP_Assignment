I am with Enron?s thermal power generation company in Panama. Ours is the largest thermal power plant (320 MW) in a system with over 540 MW in hydro power capacity. In order to better program our operations for the next two years, it would help us to determine the probability of another El Nino event in the next 18 to 24 months. In case of a high probability we could even bring down a barge-mounted plant to provide back up power to Panama?s and other Central American countries which are heavily dependent on hydro power. Panama and Central America suffers serious droughts during an El Nino event.

Whatever help you can provide will be greatly appreciated.
