Greetings:
Left you a voicemail.  We spoke recently about getting a device to record 
temperature on my property in Mendocino, where I'm hoping to grow a few 
grapes.  Had a couple of questions about soil testing.  Could you give me a 
call when you have a minute at 415.782.7822.  Greatly appreciated.

Best,
Jeff
