Aruna,

I shall be available next week, except for Friday.

Hi Vince -- I hope all is well and that you have recovered from the
flooding!

Just want to follow-up on a couple of things:

Firstly I haven't received your packet of information yet, which I'm looking
forward to reviewing.

Secondly, I just found out that a couple of our business guys may be coming
to your area.  So thought it may be interesting for them to meet up with
you.  Would you be interested/available?

Regards, Aruna




I'm sorry, Vince.  It's been another very hectic day.

Thanks again for your help.

Regards,

Aruna

   Hi Vince --

   It was a pleasure speaking to you this morning.  Please find below my
   address, to which you can send the information on the energy commodities
   market.  I'll look forward to following up with you, once I have a
   chance to
   digest the information.
