I'll come see you after lunch.  Thanks, Kim.

 

I think after lunch we be ok.  We have our storage meeting today and it usually runs into lunch!

Theresa,

I've been out of town the last couple of days, can we get together later today to discuss this?  

Would you be available for lunch or right after lunch?  

Thanks, Kim.

 

Kim,

Have you thought about buying a call on the spread instead of unwinding the spread outright?  (Just a thought)

Thanks,
Theresa
