Laura,

We can definitely help Jose. We are producing the demand projections for
natural gas by state, by customer class every day. The projections
are used to forecast AGA storage numbers and have a very
good history of hitting the right number. This validate svery well the
demand model.

Getting the supply curve at a specific location is more difficult because
other regions are competing for the same finite quantity of gas
available in the short run. We have some good insights into this
problem as well.

My concern is that summer associates are not fully committed to Enron.
I have about 7-8 summer associates every year and we always take measures
to keep them away from critical information.
Please, let me know how far we can go with Jose.

I am ready to help you with baseball. I went to a game last week
and Astros won. I guess I brought some good Karma.

Vince,

Hope all is well with you.  If this baseball season continues to develop, we may need you in Chicago...

I have a summer associate in Houston, Jose Molina, who has inquired regarding Enron's ability to develop a supply/demand  curve.  In our group (Gas Fundamentals/Trading/Origination) we spend a significant amount of time and effort tracking correlations in an array of price/supply/demand scenarios.  Jose is questioning if we can take this more specifically to a scientific approach.  I recommended that he spend time with your or someone in your group to develop his idea and determine feasibility.

I would appreciate if someone could schedule time with Jose.  I always want to encourage an inquisitive nature.

Let me know.

Regards,

Laura Luce
