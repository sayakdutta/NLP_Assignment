Sasha,

This looks wonderful to me.  Thank you for all of your help.  Will you be with us during our day?  If you are available, I would love for you to be there with us.  Also,  can you help us coordinate ordering Pizza from Bira's to have during the Mad Potter event?  

Morgan,  should we just drink the wine and beer from the Mad Potter vs. bringing our own?

If Morgan is good with the memo, go ahead and distribute.  

Thanks, Kim.

 

Morgan/Kim:

	Attached is the memo I typed up for the team builder.  Please let me know of any changes you feel are necessary.  I will also provide you with directions and a map to hand out for the Social Event.  Thanks Sasha
