Debra -

Is this an agreement that Credit initiated?  How did this agreement get started?  Did Credit specify the credit language written into the document?  

Please forward a copy of the agreement to the above distribution list so that we can review.  I am unfamiliar with this counterparty and therefore very hesitant to transact until we are comfortable with the document's terms and conditions.


Thanks,

Jay

 

		
 Be advised I have  a partially executed agreement for Twine.  Please allow  them to trade on Monday.
