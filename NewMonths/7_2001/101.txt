Baytown or Texas National in Willis Texas

I checked the day trips from Houston guide and they say that these "locales" can be done with the proper prep time

PS Jerry are you even close to double digit score yet ?????

 


well e-mailing to be exact and we were planning to hopefully play some golf this weekend.  we were thinking of maybe hitting something along the lines of maybe tricky dick's part of town (baytown).  if anyone has interest or other options e-mail back, also if you can what day.  we thought about baytown because it's probably as expensive as brock but a different locale.  
 
i love losing other people's money for a living!!!!
