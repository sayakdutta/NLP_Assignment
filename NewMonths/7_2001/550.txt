No more e-mails.   I still don't have the forward FPC tariff curve.  How is this so complicated.

 

We are using the utility prices through 12/08.  Starting 1/1/2009, Enron is supplying.

OK?

 



I need the reg gen postion, transmission position, distribution position, and ancillary position.   If you have to bundle the T&D and ancillary into one position, that is fine.   However, I want the pricing assumptions for the individual pieces and our best guess for the MWh position.

Thanks.

What else do you need?





Did you use Florida curves from Friday?   The curves are much lower Friday vs. Thursday. 

 

Is this what you are interested in?
