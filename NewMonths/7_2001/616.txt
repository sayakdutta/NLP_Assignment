They have agreed to grant us access.   I granted access to power curves based on the understanding they would grant full access to all coal curves.

 

Attached are the Nymex prices for coal.

We are currently in the process of getting access to the information and will include it in the pricesheet asap. 

I have also asked for the PRB curves as well.  They are currently checking to see if they will be granting us access.
