Just got back from Austin. I was at a convention. I was a delegate to the
K.J.Z.T. Insurance Convention at the Omni Hotel.I really enjoyed it learned
quiet a bit. Had dinner with Wayne Saturday nite. It was his birthday. Happy
Birthday Wayne!!!!! He's doing o.k.

has been in a nursing home for a while now. She was 83 years old.
