Are you going to N Mexico this year?  I will not give my number out over the net.  So email

 

You can give me your home phone too if you would like in case there is a
good chance with short notice, OK?





I am not playing the game this year,  thanks anyway.  Regarding the dogs,
why don't you email someday that is good for you and we can meet.  Tiz
cannot take the heat and I will leave him behind, but Gen desperately needs
to get out.
