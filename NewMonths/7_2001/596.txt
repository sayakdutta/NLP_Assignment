Thanks for the update.   You are doing a great job and I appreciate you all your hard work.   I don't have to worry about any of the administrative issues, and that makes my job much easier.

Have fun on the trips and make sure you and Amy get well.

Thanks again.

 

Kevin,

I just wanted to give you an update with Therapy....after this Wednesday, we will go one time a week for the next four weeks and that should be it.  We have come a long way but I think we will be able to once again be healthy.  Thanks again for being understanding and supportive of us getting well.

I also wanted to make sure you knew when I will be out of the office with these trips and some vacation time:

Friday, July 20th - July 22nd...leave at 1:30pm to head to Barton Creek for Dana's Group

Monday, July 30th - Aug 2nd...leave at 9:30am with Ed Baughman's group to Cabo

Friday, Aug. 3rd - Aug 7th...taking Vacation Time to get Shelby ready for school and spend quality time with her after being gone the month of July.

Friday, Sept. 14th - 16th...leave 8am w/Corry Bentley group to Cancun

Thurs., Oct. 4th - 7th...leave 8am w/Don Baughman & Lloyd Will group to Las Vegas



Since Ed is taking two separate groups to Cabo, Lisa will go up with the first group for Oscar & Larry...they are leaving next Thurs, July 26th - 29th.  On the remaining trips I will be ahead of the Cancun & Vegas group so Claudia will bring the Cancun people up and Lisa will bring the Vegas people up.  I am somewhat close to finalizing all the trips and hope they turn out flawless.

Thanks again Kevin for all your support with my decisions for the group. I know this is a lot for the future so I will just note it on your calendar.
