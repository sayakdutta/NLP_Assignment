The Bond Legislation
The Democrats in the Assembly and Sentate have agreed to language to create a 
Dedicated Rate Component to repay the budget and de-link the bonds from the 
DWR contracts. 
But the Republicans have still not agreed to go along.  
The bill would require a 2/3's vote to keep the bond issuance on schedule, so 
Republican votes are necessary. 
The Republicans are trying to meet tonite or tomorrow to determine whether to 
go along.

The Conference Committee
Senator Burton does not like the idea of a conference committee and at this 
point prefers to use the existing committee structure to hear the 
core/noncore proposal.
Using the existing committee structure could take longer to produce a bill 
than using the conference committee structure, but how much longer is 
uncertain.
No sense yet of when hearings on the core/noncore proposal---in conference 
committee or otherwise--will take place, though Burton continues to say that 
he wants to "give it a chance."

The Core/Noncore Legislative Language
The negotiating group continues to work on the language.
The language was supposed to be delivered to Hertzberg by COB today, but more 
work needs to be done and it is now scheduled to be delivered first thing 
tomorrow morning.

Senator Dunn's Investigative Committee Hearing
The hearing's been moved from tomorrow to Wednesday.

Best,
Jeff
