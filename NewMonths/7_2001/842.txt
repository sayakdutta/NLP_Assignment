Senator Burton's office expects bond language back from Legislative
Counsel sometime tomorrow, Tuesday.  As soon as we get a copy we will
forward it.  If the language is acceptable to Enron, then Bev, Scott and
I need to visit with Republicans to urge their support as soon as
possible.We are continuing to coordinate with the big users and some
other suppliers on this issue.
