Martin,

I shall  talk to him on Thu about the details.

Last week, Eric Cope and I met with Erik Simpson and others in the Media Services group.  Though we were there to discuss some models, Erik S. mentioned the meeting that Ed Ondarza had brought up with you.  According to Erik, Media Services would still like to have Research participate in the meeting.  He will let me know the exact date and time, however, it will be close to the date that you had discussed with me.

Media Services would like to have Research present an example where we had applied some novel and sophisticated analysis to a problem that may show applicability to issues in the advertising business.  Essentially, they would like a relevant success story with a great wow-factor.
