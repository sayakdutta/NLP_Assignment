FYI

 

Two weeks ago, a member of the FRBNY legal staff asked to meet with AIG
staff to discuss AIG's present and proposed retail swap activities. I
responded that AIG does not now and has no plans to engage in that activity.
For that reason, I stated that it was premature to consider the need to
regulate an activity that does not now exist and that ought to be the
agencies response to Congress.

	interview topics/questions. Please do not hesitate to call if you
have any
