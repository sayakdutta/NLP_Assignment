Let's discuss this in our Monday meeting.   In general, though, your approa=
ch seems reasonable to me.

Kevin -

Lloyd and I spoke yesterday about the idea of outsourcing all of EES' next =
30-day physical obligations in ERCOT to the Wholesale Services Desk (Servic=
es Desk).   Essentially, we would provide Services Desk with a list of cust=
omers, meters, forecasts, and a net open position (load obligation - hedges=
).  Services Desk would fill any net open positions at some hourly index + =
service fee.  EWS-Retail would still hedge all forward risks.  How we handl=
e load forecasting as it relates to changes in our position needs to be iro=
ned out as far as whose forecasts we use - do we consolidate this function?=
 .  My view is that 1) Wholesale Services Desk could benefit by getting an =
opportunity to serve retail load and learn in a low risk position and 2) Se=
rvices Desk will ultimately perform a better service than I could begin to =
recreate.  I want this to be the model that I can build a case on to outsou=
rce all of our next 30 day physical delivery portfolio across the Eastern G=
rid.  Also, Lloyd will be able to best determine what metering capabilities=
 we really need to most accurately deliver and work these requirements thro=
ough the Ozzie/PMC model we have been working on.  Doug is also interested =
and on board with this concept.

 Kevin, you and I can negotiate an overall macro service fee for this stuff=
 once we get it ironed out.

What do you think?
