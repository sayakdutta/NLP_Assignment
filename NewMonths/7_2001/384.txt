Kate,
I will not have time today.  Perhaps it can wait till tomorrow.
Thanks,
Bill

 

I know you're busy today, but I don't want to forget to start compiling a reference manual for handling cuts. I can put something together for you to look over and add to, or I'll wait until you have a moment to put something together. Just a reminder.

Kate
