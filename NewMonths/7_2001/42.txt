Lovely.  I would like to discuss this further. Can we set up some time Thursday pm? Kay, will you coordinate a time that works for everyone? Thanks.


California counsel have advised us that, in view of the broad authority given the AG to investigate unfair business practices, a court will almost certainly order us to produce our contracts to the AG in response to the outstanding subpoena.  For the same reason a motion to quash the subpoena directed to PG&E, which seeks the identity of our customers and their status as direct access or on UDC service, would also likely fail.  They recommend that we voluntarily offer to produce the contracts and concentrate on protecting the more sensitive commercial documents (such as the type of documents Dennis Benevides develops) from disclosure.  Even with respect to those they are not very optimistic, given that the AG is willing to enter a protective order committing to keep the contents of those documents confidential.

Please let me know if you concur with this recommendation or would like to discuss on a conference call.

P.S.  If we do decide to produce our contracts we will first have to notify our customers pursuant to the confidentiality provisions of the contracts.
