Last night was good...a nice, relaxed dinner suited me just right.  As for a rematch, we'll see...I've got dinner with Monique and Jennifer (you met her downtown once I think) tonight.  So maybe Thursday or Friday night we could do something.  I'll give you a call later.

Hi Susan!  Thanks for the info.  Sounds great to me.  We'll coordinate later.  If you get a chance, send me Julie's e-mail.  Is that her name?  I guess I deleted it from my e-mails.  Give me a call this week if you're planning on a re-match with Bronwyn ("Birdee").  A beer and a chat would be great.  Hope you have a great day at work and I'll talk to you later.
