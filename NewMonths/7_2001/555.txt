Wes Colwell needs to create a new cost center for the new retail risk management organization.   My understanding is that Delainey has agreed to pay the costs for this year.   Please confirm with Wes.

Everyone -

Don and I are still using the old EES Company Code of 1596 and Cost Centers 150254 - 150258.  Do we need to change to an EWS/ENA Company #?  

LaDonna, please correct me if this is not correct.

I think we need to change company number to ENA and hopefully just transfer the same cost cemters to this new company #.
