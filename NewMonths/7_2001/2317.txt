Claudio,

The weather bond project looks like a well - defined
project. It should result in an interesting term
paper.

Vince,

Last January we contacted Prof. Myers at MIT about presenting a project for the proseminar of Financial Engineering. He contacted me today about the proseminar saying that Enron could propose something.

We (at the weather desk) think about proposing some kind of weather bond. The idea is to create awareness of the weather market rather than the specific structure. We would propose a simple structure (with educational purposes).

Let me know your thoughts about this idea.

Thanks,

Claudio
