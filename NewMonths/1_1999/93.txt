Thanks very much Anita - that makes good sense to me.  I'll coordinate 
through QD.

Hi Mark -

Julia Deans from the QD Singapore office  got in touch with me this morning.  
Apparently Warren is in Tokyo on a work assignment until February so it won't 
be so easy to meet up with him as we'd hoped.  Warren  offered to  try and 
fly into Singapore this weekend to meet the 3 of us but I told Julia that I'd 
have to confer with you first when Houston opens today.  However,  following  
that conversation, Julia's note (see below)  came in. 

Seeing that Warren will be in your 'vicinity' next month - it certainly makes 
far more sense for him to wend his way to Houston in February so I shall tell 
Julia to shelve Warren's initial offer to fly into Singapore this weekend. 

I will forward Warren's academic details to you upon receipt from Julia.

Thanks,
Anita

Dear Anita,

It was good to talk to you this morning and I hope we will meet in person 
soon.  In the meantime, I wanted to let you know that Warren Simmons will be 
on vacation for two weeks beginning in early February.  He is planning to go 
to New York City so could make himself available for a meeting in Houston 
relatively easily.

I will forward Warren's academic information to you later today.  If you need 
any other information in the meantime, please do not hesitate to let me 
know.  Our contact details are below.

Best Regards,

Julia Deans
