To make matters even more confusing, there are two Mark Taylors.  I believe 
the message you forwarded to me belongs to the Mark Taylor at EI (based in 
London).  Unfortunately, I can't forward your message to him directly (there 
seems to be a problem with the attachment).  If you still have it, can you 
send it to him at "Mark EI.London Taylor"?
