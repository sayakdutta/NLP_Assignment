Thanks for your note.  It is kind of exciting.

I think this attachment is probably the treaty you want.  I'm sorry it didn't 
"save" better but I think you can probably print it out legibly.  I have a 
copy printed from Westlaw.  Let me know if you want me to fax it.








Mark, congratulations on your promotion to Vice President.

On a more mundane matter could you have a clerk or legal assistant get me a 
copy of the Bilateral Investment Treaty between the US and Argentina.  Our 
regulatory and commercial group wants to leave no stone unturned in their 
search for how to deal with the ENARGAS.
