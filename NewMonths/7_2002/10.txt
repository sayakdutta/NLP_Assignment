Joe,

Attached is the Curtail200206.db file. I have a question about a sequence of 
events. For turbine 840006029 on June 19th the turbine is "Energy curtailed" 
(Index = 10843), THEN it has the message "Turbine Com Established" (Index = 
10855). Then there are no other messages (for that turbine) until a "Energy 
curtailed" message (Index = 11134).

Is there anything I can assume about the time between the curtailment 
messages? For example, was the turbine uncurtailed when the com established 
message was recorded? Or are did the turbine become uncurtailed and no 
message was recorded? 

Thanks,
Mark
