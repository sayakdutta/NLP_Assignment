It is an hour and a half west of Memphis.  No where.  You can smell the meat 
processing plant.  Hey, you would probably like that!

Where in the hell is Clarksdale Mississippi? And don't just tell me in

Great trip back.  I spent yesterday in Clarksdale Mississippi.  Don't make a 
point of spending your vacation there!

Can you email me Glenn's info so I can send him the hard copy?

I enjoyed our time together, and look forward to more adventures.

Kay
