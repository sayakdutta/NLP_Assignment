changed to pinnacle west - and you might mention to apb, if you feel like it, 
that it would save their time during checkout if they told tom the correct 
counterparty when the trade was done - he said apb never seems to know 
whether it's APS or pinnacle, but for his part he doesn't mind which 
counterparty it's with - anyway, just fyi...

thanks,
Kate
