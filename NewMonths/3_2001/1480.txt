I don't recall whether the concept of a development fee has been vetted with 
the accountants, as it wasn't applicable to the Intergen deal.

  Hi Carolyn,

  Please email me the execution version of the documents
signed last week, as
  well as the current version of the other documents.  Were
the originals put
  in the mail?  My assistant isn't here, so I can't tell what
I have yet.

  Thanks,

  Kay
