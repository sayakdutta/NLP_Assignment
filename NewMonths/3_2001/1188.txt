Hi John,

I'll be glad to consider using Aaron.  Let me take a look at the agreements 
first, before we commit.  Did Bob Carter work on these agreements?  He might 
have copies, and he won't charge us for them.  At least I don't think he will.

Thanks for your understanding and patience this week.

I hope everything is going OK.

With Kathleen's help and Jeff Hodge's review the CA went out on Wednesday via 
email to BPUB.  Mitch and I are reviewing the TEX/MEX agreements to determine 
an appropriate commercial structure with the intent of preserving as much of 
the "legalese" in the original agreements (i.e., the development agreement 
and the participation agreement) as possible.  Our major concern is to keep 
this off Balance Sheet.  

 I'll call B &P to see if they have electronic versions.  Would you consider 
having Aaron Roffwarg of B & P work on this agreement, he was previously 
involved in the drafting of the agreements and he knows all of the players 
and their habits.

I'm still out of town, but now I have email access.  Did your CA get taken 
care of?

You mentioned that you feel like we can use Tex-Mex as a go-by.  Do you have 
electronic copies of the development agreement?

Thanks,

Kay
