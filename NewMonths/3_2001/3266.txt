Ann Ballard in the Corp. legal dept. called me about these guys today.  You 
might check with her to see where things stand.

Any thoughts, recommendations?




Any news on us getting Enron On-Line?  My understanding is the attorneys need
to file with FERC for approval.  However, the bigger question is whether Enron
will allows us to file with FERC and that it won't be counter productive with
the corporate strategy for PGE.

Obviously, we're anxious to start trading on-line so let me know if you have
questions.  Thanks.
