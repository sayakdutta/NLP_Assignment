ACTION ITEMS from today's IEP member company lobbyist conference call:

AB 60x (Hertzberg)
- Calpine will attempt to get a meeting with the Speaker on Monday regarding
his interest in other "California First" avenues, and report the results to
IEP.

- In anticipation of using Plan B, there will be a drafting meeting on
Friday (3/16) at 11am in IEP's office to fine-tune the current IEP proposed
amendments (attached).

- All available lobbyists will push the Speaker's office to hold off on
moving the bill until IEP has had an opportunity to present language.

- E+M will schedule a follow-up conference call on this issue early in the
week.

- IEP will explore the possibility of an editorial campaign regarding the
poor direction of this "California First" issue, tying it to long-term
contracting.


SB 6x (Burton)
- Review IEP proposed amendments to soften the eminent domain language
(attached).

- All available lobbyists will make contact with the Pro tem's office to
support the IEP amendments.


AB 8x (Migden)
- Review IEP comments that mitigate the EOB's authority in the coordinate of
operation and maintenance scheduling (attached).

- All available lobbyists will make contact with Assembly Member Migden's
office to support a stakeholder meeting taking place, because IEP would like
to make this bill work.


SB 39x (Speier)
- IEP will explore the possibility of including in its PR efforts on
maintenance and outages, the IOU- and labor-run nuclear facility being down
for an extended period of time.

PLEASE SHARE ANY INFORMATION YOU GET WITH ME FROM YOUR CONTACT WITH ANY OF
THE ABOVE-NAMED MEMER'S OFFICES.

THANKS.
