Greetings:

The governor will be holding a press conference and availability at 4:00
today to supposedly discuss the QF and Blackouts issues.  There are no
written documents or available materials at this time.  We do understand
that it will be satellite unlinked so there is a chance some stations may
carry it live.  If you have access to the Internet or squawk box you can
listen into room 1190- no guarantee they will be airing the press
conference.

This is all based or rumor and research and the Governor's office has not
confirmed anything.

In the event there is a press conference IEP will be orchestrating a
response immediately.

We will keep you posted.
