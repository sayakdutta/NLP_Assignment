Steve,

Thanks for forwarding.  Actually, Brian sent it to me on Monday, and I 
followed up with Ann and Barbara.  I have not spoken with Brian yet because I 
am waiting for a green/red light from Barbara as far as Jade Eaton is 
concerned.  Barbara and I spoke at length yesterday and she is concerned 
about the counterparty's reaction to a meeting with DOJ (even an informal 
one).  She plans to get back to me though with regard to whether they want me 
to get involved at this stage.  I spoke to Rick as well so he is up-to-date 
with the current status.  

I'll let you know if anything further develops.  Thanks again.

Lara
