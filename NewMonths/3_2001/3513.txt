Good morning,
Recent developments in California's power crisis:

-Yesterday, Governor Davis announced that the DWR has signed 40 contracts f=
or=20
8,886 MW per year, over the next 10 years and at an average price of $69 pe=
r=20
mWh. The DWR also has agreements in =01&principle=018 to cover 65-70% of it=
s net=20
short power position this summer.
-We remain cautious on the power purchase agreements, given past results of=
=20
the state=01,s power auctions. At least two generators have indicated that,=
=20
while they have signed MOUs with the DWR, the agreements are not definitive=
=20
and issues still need to be resolved.
-Also yesterday, District Court Judge Lew scheduled a trial date of July 31=
=20
for Edison=01,s lawsuit against the CPUC.
-On Thursday, the CPUC will address several utility issues.  Of particular=
=20
importance is the allocation of customer revenues to the DWR. The method of=
=20
allocation is expected to determine whether the DWR or the utilities are at=
=20
greater risk for undercollection.
-We believe many uncertainties still remain. It is unclear when the state=
=01,s=20
conceptual agreements with the utilities and the generators will be finaliz=
ed=20
in addition to how the legislature will receive the agreements.
-Consequently, we believe that investors should avoid EIX ($15.21, Hold) an=
d=20
PCG ($14.75, Hold), unless they have a high tolerance for risk and volatili=
ty.
