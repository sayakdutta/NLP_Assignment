A woman went to a pet shop and immediately spotted a large beautiful =
parrot. There was a sign on the cage that said $50.00. "Why so little," =
she asked the pet store owner.=20

The owner looked at her and said, "Look, I should tell you first that =
this bird used to live in a house of prostitution, and sometimes it says =
some pretty vulgar stuff."=20

The woman thought about this, but decided she had to have the bird =
anyway. She took it home and hung the bird's cage up in her living room =
and waited for it to say something. The bird looked around the room, =
then at her, and said, "New house, new madam."=20

The woman was a bit shocked at the implication, but then thought "that's =
not so bad."  When her two teenage daughters returned from school the =
bird saw them and said, "New house, new madam, new girls."=20

The girls and the woman were a bit offended but then began to laugh =
about the situation. Moments later, the woman's husband, Keith, came =
home from work.=20

The bird looked at him and said, "Hi Keith."
