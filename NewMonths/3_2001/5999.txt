I'm working on Samantha's IMC Canada.  It was signed by faxed signatures 
yesterday and I am expecting the originally signed documents to come in by 
Federal Express today.

Good morning ladies,

Just wanted to remind everyone to make sure that you turn in your Canada 
reports to Mary Cook by the end of today.

Thanks.
