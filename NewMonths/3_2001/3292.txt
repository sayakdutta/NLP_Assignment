I guess it looks OK to me.  I'm surprised that they will have the ability to 
identify their own company as a counterparty.  Don't we limit the companies 
they can designate to those already signed up to trade on EnronOnline?

Mark,

There is a new message to add to the set you previously reviewed, covering 
the case where a broker tries to transact when identifying their own company 
as the counterparty:

Failure Reason: Cannot Complete Transaction to Broker Company
Text Body: The requested Transaction has not completed as the Counterparty 
identified for the transaction attempt is your own company.  For further 
information or to request a change in status, please contact us.

I have passed this text along for incorporation (we have very tight timelines 
as we are hoping to go live tomorrow night).

If you have any significant concerns about the above, let me know so we can 
change it.

Thanks,

Dave
