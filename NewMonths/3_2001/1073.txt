You have excellent sources.







and I hear you wear Hawaiin shirts to the office on game days. . . . .



I'm an expert at being a rabid fan and excellent arm chair manager.  I keep
waiting for the Skipper to call for advice....

Sorry for the late notice - have been underwater this week trying to get
Tex-Mex and Alamac buttoned up, and just realized today that I needed to
get on this.  Will hope to see you there and try to find another time we
can go.  My understanding from all is that you are the resident baseball
expert (next to Ken Lay).

Best regards.

I would love to take you up on it, but I'm already lined up to go.  I'll
take a raincheck!

Thanks for thinking of me.

My recollection is that each of you is somewhat of a baseball fan, as I am.
I just happen to have 4 great seats for Opening Day at Enron Field, for
which I very much need company to help me enjoy.  I would love it if each
of you could join me.  The game starts at 4:05 pm, so it might require
leaving the office a little early.  But of course we would be discussing
serious business the entire time so that it would be fully justifiable to
anyone interested.  I will bring my legal pad to take notes.

Let me know.  Hope you can come.
