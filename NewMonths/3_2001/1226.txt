I cannot imagine a shirt larger than the one you received.  Yikes.  Sounds 
like Neil still has a chance for a new shirt.

We'll have to allow extra time next Monday for a double de-brief.

Must confess that it's a bit wierd with you not being here.  Although we've 
talked on the phone, I''ve ginda gotten used to having a face-to-face weekend 
debrief each morning to let my coffee kick in.

PS  Scott also got thw rong shirt size from A&K, he wears XXL and is 
disappointed he only got a XL.  I sure hope that they got JD's size right.  
I'll have to check with Lance and see what he got.
