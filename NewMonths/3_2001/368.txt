550206 - price is in correctly at $187.27 because this deal is a sale from 
EPMI to EES
 (550205 is the deal where EPMI buys from EES - price is therefore $5 less 
than weighted average, making it $177.27)

552990 - price is in at $195 off peak and $295 on peak, which are the prices 
reflected in my worksheet 
 Brooklyn may be looking at a price for a real time deal. If the desk is 
Short Term West Hourly, that means the deal was done in the    hour-ahead, 
not day-ahead market, and the price will be different. Bill Williams at the 
real time desk should be sending out a spreadsheet   outlining the deals 
they've done on EES's behalf. 

Please let me know if this answers your questions. Or call and we can discuss 
it person to person.
