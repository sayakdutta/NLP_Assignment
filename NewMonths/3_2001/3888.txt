with.

Best,
Jeff

Attached is the TW expansion filing press release.  With the filing being 
made on Thursday, March 29, we'll plan to issue the release to natural gas 
industry publications after the market closes on Thursday, March 29. 

Please review the press release one last time.  This draft includes changes I 
previously received from Rex, Drew, Steve Harris, Mary Kay Miller, Stan and 
Shelley Corman.

Please let me know if you have additional changes by noon on Thursday, March 
29.

Also attached is a filing fact sheet that will be used as reference for media 
calls.  Please let me know of changes to the fact sheet by Thursday, March 
29, at noon as well.

Thanks for your immediate attention.
