I thought about you every day, but I figured you'd be better off with peace 
and quiet.  

My dad is doing fine.  He is very relieved to have it over with.  Last week 
was just nuts.  

Are you still in a lot of  pain?  It takes a while to get your strength back, 
so don't push it.  Your body has a lot of healing to do.  Aren't you glad you 
used the Torso Track so that you had decent abdominal strength? It is amazing 
all the things you use those muscles for.

I can't tell you how much I miss you.  Take care, and I'll write if there's 
any good gossip.

I'm home!  I've got to go lay down though, I think I've 
been up too long.  This is the most I've been ambulatory 
since a week ago Friday!  Miss you!  How's your dad?  Suz
