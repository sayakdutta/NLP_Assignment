Hey, DUDE!  Have you forgotten to read your Lotus Notes today?  Looks like 
this one filtered through lots of people (since you left, multiple people 
fill your shoes).  And where did you hear it was nice over in Houston?  It's 
raining with a high of 54 F.  But it is supposed to reach mid-70's over the 
weekend.

I'll ask Susan B. to send you a copy.  Stay tuned for the mad cow email.

It's raining.  Again.  I hear Houston is nice.
