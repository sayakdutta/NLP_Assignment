You are going to hate me.  I lost all my little notes on the 40,000 backhaul 
and the 40,000 backhaul IT contract.  Would you email that to me please?









The term is March through Oct.
For March, you use K# 910076
For Apr-Oct, you use K# 910077

The demand is .03,  the ACA is .0022 and the commodity and fuel is
different depending on what zone you use.

If you use STX to M3, the commodity is .0623,  ETX or ELA  to M3, the
commodity is .0570, and the commodity WLA to M3, the commodity is .0586.
 let me know what else you need????
