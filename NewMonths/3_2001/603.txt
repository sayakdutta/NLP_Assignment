I am getting a tournament bracket together for the group. Here are the 
important details - $10 per entry, bonus points per upset predicted are the 
differential between the seeds(i.e. 12 beats a five you get 1 pt for the 
victory and seven points for the upset), first round games worth 1 pt., and 
the points for each subsequent round are the round plus 1 pt. (championship 
game worth 7 pts., sixth round plus 1 pt.), tie breaker is total points 
scored in final game.  Brackets are due on my desk or in my email box by 8 
a.m. CST Thursday March 15th.  Here is a link to a bracket.  Please forward 
to anyone you think may be interested.
