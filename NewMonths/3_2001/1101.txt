Hi there,

I don't know who has or wants to look at the deal docs, but here's the main 
one.  I'm giving it a close look this am, since I haven't been involved in 
this deal for a little while.

Herman, this is the transaction we discussed on the phone a couple of weeks 
ago.  

Lisa and Catherine, I'm pondering the logistics of selling the new turbine in 
the pack with the current ones.  I have a call in to Lee Johnson to discuss 
it with him, just to make sure he is on board. I know it can be done, we just 
have to figure out the paper trail.  

Chip, I haven't received the Hancock letter yet.

Stephen, your close review of the document would be greatly appreciated.

Talk to all soon,

Kay

PS.  Anna Claire Sole arrived at 200am today.
