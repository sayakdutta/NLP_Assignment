Diana stepped out of the office for a minute, but I left the e-mail printout 
on her desk and I'll talk to her about it when she gets in.

There are four deals on the no report that look like they sould be 
confirmed.  Can you take a look at them and check to see why they are coded 
not to be confirmed?

I guess you have seen the email that shows what your computer looks like when 
you work in (or apparently near) California?  You open it and the screen 
starts moving around.

Stay well!
