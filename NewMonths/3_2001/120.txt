I called and left a message requesting two tickets for the reception...I will let you know if we get them.  I'll try and give you a call later today.  I'm not actually leaving until Thursday for the Caymans though, so if you're up for steak night etc. Wednesday night let me know.  It can't be a late night for packing reasons, but I'd like to do something.
