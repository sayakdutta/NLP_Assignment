Congratulations on a healthy new baby!  Tyler is sort of a southern name - I like it!  As for me - I got a call last November to come back and market gas in the west.  I didn't think there was much going on out there but decided to go for it for personal reasons.  got here Jan. 2 and gas had completely blown out in the west.  So far, it seems like it was a good move for me.  

My house in PDX sold in 4 days and I came to Houston between Christmas and New years and found a place here.  Still trying to move in as I can't get anything done during the week!  Just had new blinds put in yesterday.

Let me know if you are ever in town - keep in touch

Hey you. I didn't know you were in Houston. You are over there on the gas
side?! WOW!! When did that happen?
You always did like Houston didn't you. I bet you are having a great time
doing gas. It is quite a market these days.

I didn't go to Phoenix because I just had a baby boy. Tyler is his name. He
was born March 6th. I have a couple of boys now  they will be just fine if
they take after their daddy.

Other than the new arrival things are pretty much steady in my life. Things
are going very well here at Mirant (quite the new name eh!).

Give me an update on your life - being in Houston and all now.

Talk to you soon


Cheers






Scotty,

Didn't see you in Phoenix last week - I actually was in PHX for meetings
and crashed the power party!  How are things?  Houston is good and gas is
great right now.  Let me know how you are -

Kim
