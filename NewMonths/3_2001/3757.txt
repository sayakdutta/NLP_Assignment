FYI.  Any thoughts Joe & Co.? Is release from contracts an "increase supply" 
option?  My fear is that QFs get released and then California's "police 
state" mentality kicks in, enacting Exec Orders, legislation, etc. to ensure 
that the power from the QF facilities stays in California.

Best,
Jeff

We are trying to set up energy purchasing arrangements with QFs who get 
temporarily released from their contracts.  Take a look at the e-mail below 
and see if we can suport them.

Thanks

Gentlemen,

In light of the possible backouts in California today and later this week,
if it is possible, Ridgewood Power requests that your organization intervene
in support of the attached emergency filing at the FERC.  Please send this
e-mail to your firm's general counsel and ask him to contact either our
Washington counsel, Carol Smoots (202-496-7196), our general counsel, Dan
Gulino (800-331-8006, x-118) or me at (800-331-8006, x-163).  Any help would
be most appreciated.

Sincerely yours,

Bill Short
