Two Ferrel International tickets above on Feb 1 & Feb 2 were changed in the system
to Ferrell North America by Derek Bailey.  This in incorrect.  Ferrel International is a different
corporation and the deals should stand as the trader wrote them.  New confirms in
the original name, Ferrel International, need to be resent.

This is the main reason that I have asked all your contract people to NOT change
counterparty names on my deals.  Many times, credit has incorrectly requested
counterparty name changes.  I would appreciate it if you would NOT change counterparty
on my deals.

Please let us know if you have any trouble resending these confirms.
