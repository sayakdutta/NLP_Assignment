Quick question to Joe and/or Christian, John and Mary:

I'm assuming that any deal we sign with DWR that falls below the $150/MWH 
soft cap is free and clear of the order FERC issued on Friday as well as any 
other refund risk associated with FERC's December order.  Is that correct? 
Thanks.

Best,
Jeff
