Stewart:

I spoke with Jeff and he will arrange a conference call next week with the 
tribe's CFO and legal counsel.  I highlighted the "eligibility" (eligible to 
enter into swaps under the CFTC regulations) and jurisdictional issues for 
Jeff regarding Indian tribes.  Of course, all of the other governmental 
counterparty concerns are here as well.

The tribe is located in Oregon.  I'll follow up with you next week.
