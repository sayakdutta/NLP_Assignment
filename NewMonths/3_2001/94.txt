Because Avista is on Pacific Standard Time, it can't consider and respond to 
your invitation for comments by noon EST.  We will get back to you as soon as 
we can.  Our question is whether the proposed  notice of bankruptcy should 
categorically concede that FERC's charge back proceeding and all other 
pending FERC proceedings against the CalPX are automatically stayed?  Or 
should we leave room for the PX and the charge back complainants to work out 
an agreement that the charge back case does not involve the PX's assets, and 
thus is not subject to the stay?  We are seeking input from Avista's 
bankruptcy counsel.

Attached is the letter that we intend to file at FERC today regarding the 
bankruptcy petition.  Please let us know by noon today if you have any 
comments.
