Hi Chris and Ben,

Wanted to make sure you had seen/approved these.  I'm looking now also.

Hi there,

Could one of you send me one email with the final (well, we hope) forms of 
both of the two change orders we are working on for the BD turbine sets? I 
want to make sure I'm looking at the right stuff.

Thanks,

Kay
