Enron has some vested interest in this legislation. We own interest in 
FuelCell Energy, Inc. and in a new micro-turbine company (SoloEnergy). At 5 
MW there is not a lot of opportunity for Origination. On the other hand, at 5 
MW it should be easy to permit this stuff and get units on-line in a matter 
of a few weeks. 

This legislation limits the technology by setting very low emissions 
thresholds. Many of the existing micro-turbines are not this clean. This 
legislation also assumes that the DG is at end-used sites. In my experience, 
my small distribution utilities will benefit by installing DG at their 
substations and at other sites throughout their service areas.
