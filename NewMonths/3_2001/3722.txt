Greetings Professor:

Our group consists of Jeff Dasovich, Mark Guinney, Anil Sama and Carolyn 
Vavrek.

We propose to examine the recently failed acquisition by Coke of Quaker 
Oats:  Why merge?  What was the value?  Upside?  Downside?  Why did it go 
bust?  Should it have gone through?  What's up with this Buffet guy, anyway?  

If you have any concerns with this proposal, please let us know.  

Finally, if possible, we'd like to present on Thursday, April 26th.

Best,
Jeff
