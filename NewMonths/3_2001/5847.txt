Sara,
Thank you for your fax.
Section 180.3 of the CEA prohibits us from agreeing to any settlement
procedure/forum ahead of time.  JPMFI, in accordance with 180.3, will offer
3
forums - which will include AAA.  If Enron chooses AAA, the arbitration
will be
subject to the provisions specified in your fax dd 2/26/2001.

Attached is JPM's proposed language for the arbitration agreement.

(See attached file: ARBITRATION AGREEMENT.doc)

If you are in agreement with the language, please forward Enron's proposed
language (detailed in your 2/26 fax) electronically (if available).

Thank you and Regards,
Corinne
