Is this for the  turbines being sold to Delta as opposed to the new 
replacement equipment?

Thanks,

Bill Williams has confirmed that the attached version of the LVC-2 contract 
is the final form.  I have added a footer stamp identifying it as "Rev 5 - 
3/27/01".  Everything else is identical to the draft circulated March 12.


The second attachment is to be inserted as Exhibit H-2 in the contract.  

Thanks.
