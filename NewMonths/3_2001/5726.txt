Yes, my recollection is that Janelle was negotiating a deal with these guys 
in January, 2001.  I had conversations with David Adams and Grant Adamson but 
I can't recall if the swaption was ever executed.  I discussed the 
confirmation problem with David and noted that a small percentage of confirms 
were being marked  inconsistently (in Dec., 2000) after months of trading 
without any changes at all.  He was too busy to focus (and was a new lawyer, 
I think, which is why changes were appearing in the omnibus).

Has anyone recently spoken with this counterparty's legal group about the 
revisions that they are marking on confirms that they have been receiving?
