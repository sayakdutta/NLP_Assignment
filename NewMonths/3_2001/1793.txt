He didn't invite me.  He don't know what's good for him does he?  AND he 
lives in a bad neighborhood.

Well, the time has finally arrived............after purchasing some bean bag 
and inflatable 'Southpark' chairs, I'm officially ready for a party.  Won't 
you please come  over and share in a few cocktails.   This Saturday, March 31 
at 7:30,  1314 Utah St.  (corner of Truro and Utah, near Memorial Park)   I 
will have beverages and snacks, but as in the past, no jello shots or Busch 
beer.  (sorry Matt and Mike)

Most of you aren't aware of where I live, but parking could be a problem. 
(sorry, no valet)   In the 'hood', people tend to park wherever they can, 
this being along all the streets surrounding the house as well as the 
volleyball courts at Bubbas.  Park wherever you can.

Please see the attached map or go to Yahoo Maps for assistance.  It works 
well if you use 1380 Utah St.  (Don't ask why)    Please pass this on to 
others that I may have overlooked.  Call if you have any questions.
