I sent this to Rick Shapiro and Mark Palmer as well.  This is an ad created 
for use in the Ontario market and would include the logos of the signatory 
companies (rather than individual signatures).Aleck Dadson worked with GPC on 
its creation.  It is part of the total plan, which includes Ken Lay's visit 
to Toronto April 4 to meet with media and government leaders.

Give me your thoughts.

Eric

Eric:

As requested by Aleck Dadson, please find attached a copy of an open letter
to the Premier of Ontario which we are proposing be placed as an ad in the
National Post and the Globe & Mail next week. It is our intention to have
the letter signed by a group of energy stakeholders including Enron,
TransAlta, ATCO, Toronto Hydro, Mississauga Hydro, Dynegy, The Toronto Board
of Trade, The Ontario Chamber of Commerce, the Independent Power Producers
Society of Ontario, etc.
