RE: Legislative Status Report Week Ending 3/2


RECENT EVENTS:

-- AB 8x (Migden), which would give the EOB additional and undefined powers
related to the coordination of operation and maintenance schedules, passed
the Assembly ECA committee 14 to 0.  This measure came from the Governor=01=
,s
office in response to one of his Executive Orders.  IEP, along with several
IEP members, opposed the bill in committee, but noted commitments to workin=
g
with the author on language.

IEP counsel drafted comments which are attached.  PLEASE PROVIDE COMMENT BY
NOON ON MONDAY so that these changes may be considered by the author before
the next committee hearing.  The measure will go to the Assembly
Appropriations Committee next.

-- AB 60x (Hertzberg), which would have required, as a condition of
permitting a powerplant, developers to offer to sell the power to Californi=
a
entities, was pulled from the Assembly ECA Committee hearing at the last
minute.  IEP is working with the Chair of the committee and the Speaker=01,=
s
office on appropriate language that would preferably not be tied to the
siting process but provide the needed political cover on this new, growing
=01&California First=018 concept.  Any suggestions on how to deal with the
=01&California First=018 issue is welcomed.

-- IEP, along with the other QF stakeholders, had an opportunity to brief
the Senate Energy Committee staff on SB 47x (Battin).  The measure will be
heard in the committee on Tuesday next week.

-- The Senate Environmental Quality committee met this week to hear SB 28x
(Sher/Battin) which makes various changes to the siting process including
many IEP-sponsored proposals.  So far this is the most comprehensive and
positive siting bill introduced, with the greatest chance of moving forward=
.
The bill passed out of the committee on a 7 to 0 vote even though most of
the environmental community testified in opposition.  Chris Ellison and I
are continuing to work with the authors=01, staff to develop additional
language which should be available before the measure is heard in the Senat=
e
Energy Committee on Tuesday.

-- AB 45x (Kelley) also passed 7 to 0 out of the Assembly Revenue and
Taxation Committee this week.  AB 45x would extend the manufacturers
investment credit (MIC) to include the generation of electricity through th=
e
use of solar, wind, geothermal, solid-fuel biomass, waste tire, municipal
solid waste, digester gas, or hydropower with a generating capacity of 30
megawatts or less.  The bill does not include a generator who produces
electricity for sale to a utility pursuant to a contract originally entered
into before January 1, 2001.  The committee staff estimates revenue losses
in the range of $5 to $10 million annually beginning in 2001-02. Sponsored
by CalEnergy, AB 45x will heard in the Assembly Appropriations Committee
next.

-- AB 36x (Wright), which would apply specified repower projects to the
6-month expedited siting process established in AB 970 (2000), passed out o=
f
the Assembly Energy Costs and Availability Committee 17 to 0.  IEP testifie=
d
in support of the bill, noting we were still working with the author on
language.  IEP continues to believe that with the current language, few, if
any, projects would qualify and is working with staff on fixing that.
Recent conversations, however, with one of Asm. Wright=01,s staff indicates
Wright would be willing to drop the bill if the language IEP wants is
already in another measure (SB 28x).  Wright would then carry some other
siting language IEP supports and not in any other vehicle.  I will be
follow-up on this next week and welcome any suggestions.

-- ACR 4x (Cohn), which urges the CEC to move swiftly to license the Metcal=
f
Energy Center and to permit its construction., passed off the Assembly floo=
r
71 to 0.  The measure, which has 5 primary authors and 42 co-authors, is
headed to the Senate a policy committee hearing.

-- A hearing in the Assembly Natural Resources Committee for AB 34x (La
Suer), which would make various changes to the siting process, including
some IEP-sponsored proposals, was put off again.  The author will be
accepting amendments that will make it a study bill in the special session.
The author will try to move the larger measure in its original form during
the regular session.

-- The Senate Energy Committee held an informational hearing on Energy
Market Reform this week.  Stakeholders, especially the generators, were
grilled on current market problems and solutions.  Senator Bowen, Chair of
the committee, was clearly unhappy with generator=01,s comments.  It is
unclear, however, how forthcoming her staff was regarding what participants
should have been prepare for in terms of the of the line of questioning tha=
t
came primarily from Senators Bowen and Dunn.  Bowen suggested she was going
to hold another hearing on the issue on a date to be determined later.

--  Attached is the most recent legislative tracking report of all the
special session bills introduced to date.  I have separated out the regular
session list of bills since the list was getting out of control.  I will
send that list under separate cover as I=01,m still plowing through the ove=
r
1,300 bills that were introduced last Friday.  Please let me know if you
need copies of any of these bills.
