We have received word that Conyers and House Judiciary Democrats will oppose
the Oxley Amendment based on jurisdiction and acceptance of substantial
amendments.  We further understand that Gephardt remains supportive of the
amendment.  I would encourage as many calls as possible to the list of
members below encouraging support of the Oxley/LaFalce Amendment.

Points to keep in mind/mention:
- Most of the amendments are necessary to conform bankruptcy statute to the
Commodity Futures Modernization Act passed last year.
- Certain other provisions are necesary in order to update the bankruptcy
code for financial product netting.
- These are necessary to diminish systemic risk to the financial system.
- This is a bipartisan amendment supported by John LaFalce.
- Please support the Oxley-LaFalce Amendment.
