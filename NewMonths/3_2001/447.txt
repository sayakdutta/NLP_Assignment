Dave Poston and the other IT guys are working on this problem right now. 
Apparently from 3/9 onward EOL has not been pulling the schedule type into 
its deals, so they're ALL going to have problems saving. Isn't that fun? Dave 
told me that the problem will be solved by tomorrow afternoon at the latest, 
and that it will retroactively populate those schedule types into all EOL 
deals so you'll be able to save them. Sorry for the hassle. I'll keep you 
posted if anything else comes up.

Thanks,
Kate

Hi Kate, I know you are working on this problem.  This deal will not let me 
save it because it wants the schedule type filled in.  Let me know if there 
is a schedule type I can choose or if I should just wait until the problem is 
fixed.

Thanks,
Melissa
