Re: Deal discrepancies for the month of February. Following are the problems 
that have been brought to my attention and the solutions we've reached. 
Please call me with questions. 


2/25. Sorry for the confusion - per Bill Williams III.


This spreadsheet includes modified volumes in the fixed price sale at ZP-26 
on 2/6. 



In addition, deal 525625.2 has been corrected in scheduling (there was one 
strip duplicating HE 8) and autoscheduled.  Deal 529314.1 has also been 
autoscheduled, which should remedy the discrepancy on 2/24, HE 7-17. Please 
let me know if the new CARP report does not reflect this.

Thanks,
Kate Symes
