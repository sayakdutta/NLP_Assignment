In concert with others, the Enron legislative team participated in defeating 
the Wyden Amendment.  It was tabled 67-30.   very good outcome.

The Wyden Amendment to the Bankruptcy Bill is being debated on the Senate 
floor as we speak. If it passes,the QF's in California will be severly 
imnpaired ina bankruptcy proceeding. I hope that you have contacted your 
Congressional representatives. Feinstein is fighting this and Boxer has 
suppoted, then opposed it, and may be supporting it again. EPSA and EEI 
opposed the Amendment. Jan--has IEP weighed in yet?
