Renee and Brian,

Please prepare a change order to add dual fuel to the February '02 delivery 
turbine.  The price and commercial information is below.  I have gotten Jeff 
Darst to extend the deadline to exercise the change order to 16 March 2001.

Please make sure we get the change order prepared before the deadline expires.

Chris
