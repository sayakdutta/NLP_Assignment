26th - I'm not sure Steve will be back from an offsite.

Steve is open March 27th and 28th.  

He will probably be out of town on the 29th and 30th.

I need to schedule a cultivation dinner for our 3 Rice summer intern 
candidates and would like for Steve, Mark, or Brad to attend, if at all 
possible.

Please let me know if and when you would be available March 26-30 for  dinner 
.  The candidates' accept deadline is April 4.

Thank you!
