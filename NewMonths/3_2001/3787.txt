Did she respond back?  Did you respond to the Haas address?  (Man, now I'm 
REALLY getting paranoid.)

Greetings Professor:

Our group consists of Jeff Dasovich, Mark Guinney, Anil Sama and Carolyn
Vavrek.

We propose to examine the recently failed acquisition by Coke of Quaker
Oats:  Why merge?  What was the value?  Upside?  Downside?  Why did it go
bust?  Should it have gone through?  What's up with this Buffet guy,
anyway?

If you have any concerns with this proposal, please let us know.

Finally, if possible, we'd like to present on Thursday, April 26th.

Best,
Jeff
