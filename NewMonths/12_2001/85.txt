		>                 You, or a representative from your
organization, are invited > to attend a meeting on December 11, 2001 from
2pm to 4pm in our offices. It > has been some time since the group has met
and in the mean time we, as well as the System Controller, have put > some
processes in place to address the ongoing supply adequacy concerns > within
Alberta. We would like to review how the > current processes are working and
examine areas for improvement.  We have received, from the majority, the
2002 maintenance plans. I would propose the following draft agenda and would
request additional agenda items from yourself prior to the meeting. A final
agenda would be issued before the meeting.

		1.Review of adequacy forecasts and presentation of
information.
		2.Adequacy projections for the 2001 winter peak and 2002.
		3.System restoration plans and roles.
