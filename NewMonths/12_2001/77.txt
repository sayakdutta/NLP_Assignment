You should talk to Jess about that, she is due March 2 but I am not sure when her mom is coming and going.  I would think that the 2 week in march is good though.  Look forward to seeing you tomorrow.

 

when is jessica due?  i want to book tickets out to see you guys in feb /
march, but i want to make sure that you have time to get settled before i
come.  i have to order tickets by dec 24th, as ali has a special 2 for 1
coupon so he can come with me too.

what timing is best?
