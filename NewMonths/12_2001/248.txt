Where is the DPOS folder?

No prob.  Can you request DPOS through ERequest - I believe we still do it that way.

My group is now:

Shona
Chris
Susie Ayala
Susan Trevino

I'm putting together a list of everything we used to do and working on determining which things we should prioritize.  Until I complete that, can you ensure that all requests for info go through me?

Thanks a million!

Shona -

Can you get Stacey and I access to the DPR in executive viewer.  Also,  can you get us acess to the DPOS folder so that we can link in for requests that are coming in from the banks.

Thanks
