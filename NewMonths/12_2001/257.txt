I have no idea how the contracts are being handled.  If he is that unhappy he should talk to Billy Lemmons (the associate HR rep).

Not sure, I think it is just a one year contract.

 

He would definitely be going to clean-up if we start the new company.  If we do not start the new company he would be the first person laid off.  What kind of contract is he under?

Stacey wanted to let you know that myself and the rest of the group feel and know that Nick does not want to be here. You could tell during the conference call yesterday with you that he was somewhat disappointed that he was not laid off. He has other avenues that I think he wants to pursue. Wanted to know if we have any recourse on this since he under contract right now. I have not approached him about it but have been tempted to just so he will get his act together. Here is a person who would rather be laid off than continue to work while people have been laid off who do not want to leave. It has rubbed some people the wrong way. 

We are overstaffed currently and we would not lose a step with one less person.

Let me know your thoughts,

John
