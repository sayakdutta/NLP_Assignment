	Tomorrow at 9:00 a.m. would be better for me.  I would appreciate it.  Thanks. Lynn

 


Today at 2:00 is fine for me.

Randy Howard has requested that I reach each of you to set up a conference call regarding the Tate Issue.  He wants to know if you would be available this afternoon around 2:00 or tomorrow morning around 9:00.  If you could e-mail me and let me know what will work best for you, I'd appreciate it.  As soon as we hear from everyone, I'll send out another e-mail to give the details.

Thanks,
Shana Farrow
