Kirk,

Thanks for the note.  Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you and your family as well.  I look forward to catching up with you in 2002!

Hi Kim.
No update yet on the Caithness Big Sandy project.
However, I wanted to wish you and your family a wonderful holiday season.
I will catch up with you shortly after the first of the year.
Kirk
