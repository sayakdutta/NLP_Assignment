Harry --  EES filed yesterday.  My thought is to focus on keeping our licenses so that we can return customers in an orderly fashion.

One thing we need immediate clarification on is, if EES has not filed for bankruptcy yet, does that give the ICC or any other commission, less leeway with regard to stripping licenses. Mike, will EES be filing?

I would recommend that all letters as such should go to Harry and me.  I think we will be getting a number of these.  I would say that we will try and communicate something proactively to the PUCs around the country by Wed am.  Critical that our message is consistent and clear.  Rebecca, any thoughts?
