Good News!!!  The termination spreadsheets have been updated.  There are three new counterparties for physical and one new counterparty for financial.  Will Smith has moved a new version of Deal Liquidation into stage for us to use going forward.  It incorporates both his script for moving deals to Bankruptcy books and splitting deals on their termination dates.  Please look at this so we can use it on our updates.
