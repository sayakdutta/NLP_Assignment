The only issue I have is everytime I login I have some Windows Installer program I have to kill and it takes me an extra 2-3 minutes to keep closing files before I can get into my desktop.

I don't know what caused this, but I am assuming some file you installed is still trying to run.   In addition, the dial-up through Citrix is very very slow.   Is this normal?

Any thoughts?

Thanks for all your work - the printer works just fine

 

Let me know if you had any trouble.

Daniel

 

Thanks.   That will work fine with me.

 

Kevin,

I will not be able to go to your home until after 3 today.  My director told me we are too overloaded.  I will go by after I get done working today.  I will let you know before I go.

Thanks,
