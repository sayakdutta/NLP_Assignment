Greetings
A step in the right direction- the CDWR paid their bill in full for the
February 2001 trade month.

The ISO will be disbursing the dollars a week from today.  One other
important highlight is that the ISO invoiced the DWR for all charges
associated with meeting the net short of the utilities and they did pay in
full- we were expecting they would make only a partial payment. I'm glad we
were wrong.  We can now hold our breath for the rest of the $$.  Please give
me a call with any questions
