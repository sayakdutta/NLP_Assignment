Hi Kim,

All the financial deals have been moved to bankruptcy books as requested. Please verify and let me know if you have any problems.

Attached is the new list of Financial Nat. Gas deal terminations by Counterparty.  Please move all Financial Natural Gas transactions for the relevant Counterparties on the attached list to the Bankruptcy Book.  Again, I have included the CP ID's for your reference.  Please let myself and Jeff Gossett know when the move has been completed.  Please call with any questions.
