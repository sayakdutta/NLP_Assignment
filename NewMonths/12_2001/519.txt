Count me in!  Thanks, Kim.

 

It has been a tough couple of months and I know that each of you have worked hard.  I appreciate your time and commitment and hoped to something for the staff but, due to the company's dire situation, it is not possible.   
Please join me for a group lunch at Little Pappasito's on Thursday, December 20th at 11:30.  As much as I would like to treat the group, everyone would be responsible for their meal.
Please RSVP to Julie Armstrong at x33597. Hope you can attend. Thanks.
