Genaro, we restructured the deal effective with November deliveries.  I have a copy of the document if you need it.  Phillip Love and Kam Keiser are familiar with the deal if they can help.  The customer is correct in their pricing.

Frank/Scott,

Are either of you handling deal # 22957 (sell to TBG Cogen)? There is a price discrepancy for Nov. 2001.



Thanks,
Genaro
