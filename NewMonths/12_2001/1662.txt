Barbara,

It's Saturday night in Houston and Marcus (my husband) and I just hung your painting in our dining room.  It looks unbelievable - we love it.  I decided because I loved it too much to bring in home and it is now in our home.  Thankyou so much .

Tammie will sort our the money on Monday.

I love it so much I had to bring it home.It is far too good for work.

Take care and obviously our thoughts are with you at this time.  We look forward to the yellow one and we have already decided where to put it.  I will take so photos so you can see how prominent the red one is in our home.

Take care 

Louise

Louise & Tammie,
I want to thank you for the beautiful flowers you sent me, they are really
nice.
I really appreciate all your attentions with me.

Tammie as we agreed last Friday i was thinking that the easiest way to send
me the money for the painting is makingg a deposit on my mom's US account.

is almost finished and Tammie's painting it is ready! I'm just waiting it to
let it dry so I can send it. (those are Christmas gifts for both) Those are

Thanks again and talk to you on Monday.
Warm Regards,
