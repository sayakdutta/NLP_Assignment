Good news.  Also, Rich Drom called from PJM wanting to know if someone from Enron was attending the Members Mtg this Thursday (no) and if what did we want to do with the confidentiality of our credit (I think that we should agree - not PJM's to distribute).  Your thoughts - I'll call Drom back tomorrow.

I'm connected again, so please include me in correspondences, etc.  Christi, if you need to me send the note about NEPOOL decertification status, I can do that now.
 
Thanks
