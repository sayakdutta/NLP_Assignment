As of right now this is the plan for the killed transactions:
  Please use the attached spreadsheet that indicates the prior day changes in your rolls.  Then compare these actual changes to the projected changes in the spreadsheet below.  As of tonight, please top-level all prior day changes and we will tackle tomorrow.  Also, remember that traditionally you would have no financial prior days on the first business day, so the financial prior days showing up in your rolls are due to killed financial transactions.  These amounts should also be top-leveled.

Thanks,
Stacey

 

 

All deals were killed with Constellation, The Energy Authority and Public Service of Colorado.  This will cause us to have huge prior day values today.  This spread sheet has the P&L for all deals with those counterparties and Stacey will let us know what adjustments we need to make.
