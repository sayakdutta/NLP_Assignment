I'm not sure, but I have a sneaking suspicion that all you folks are finished this semester.  Just wanted to say congratulations.  I'm finished with this semester after today, but have one--that's one--class to take next semester to finish.  Also, though I can't make the ski trip this weekend, I definitely plan on skiing a lot this winter (maybe I'll see you at Squaw Deepikah), so let's stay in touch on the ski front.  Happy Holidays to all.  

And if anyone has any questions on creative off-balance sheet financing or or the ins-and-outs of bankruptcy, please feel free to get in touch.

Best,
Jeff
