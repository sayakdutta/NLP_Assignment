If there are some analysts or associates in your group who would be interested in talking to us and need a home, please feel free to have them call me or send a resume.  We would talk to anyone who can code option pricing formulas.  JAVA skills, or good Object Oriented programming experience and sufficient mathematical background for the FE work are priorities.  Our Chief Architect would like to see some Database understanding, but that is somewhat more flexible.  American options and Swing options are current issues, although any exotics experience is fine.  I would consider contract/part-time if someone would like to take a project while looking for positions with another larger company.
 
My thoughts and prayers are with you and your group.  I wish we had more immediate needs, but perhaps at the margin this can help.
 
Warm Regards,
Ashley
