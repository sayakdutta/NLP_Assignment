Doug --

It seems to me that keeping the PUC somewhat appeased makes sense.  I'll try and get some formal questions, but sooner or later they will want to talk directly. I appreciate that this is a pain, but maybe it's a good opportunity to push to get rid of balanced schedules?

Let's sit down on Thursday am and talk.

I am out til wednesday. I would be happy to answer any qustions they have if they could send them over. I am not going to educate them on anything else.

Thanks,

Doug
