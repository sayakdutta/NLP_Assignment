John, I understand you have been approached separately to provide this information.  If so, could I please have a copy of your worksheets.

Thanks, Nella

Please populate the attached worksheets for Stack Manager & Website Access. I have added the Canada product types and a drop down for each user/product type to populate with READ, EXECUTE or NONE.  For READ ONLY Website ID's, additional population is NOT necessary.  Please return to me once complete.  Let me know if you have any questions.
