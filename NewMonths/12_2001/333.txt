Hello Vince,

I thought that I would take the liberty to summarize our request after our meeting this morning:

Volatilities per commodity
Electricity
Natural Gas
Crude Oil (strip proxy?)
Aluminum (strip proxy?)
Copper (stip proxy?)
Fixed Income (US 10 year treasuries as a proxy?)
Equities (S&P 500 as a proxy?)
Currencies ($, yen or DM as a proxy)
Cross correlation matrix for each commodity with every other commodity
Correlation of power and gas volatility to Enron's trading earnings
Comparable analysis of Enron ROVAR to other trading organizations (e.g. banks, hedge funds, etc..)
Analysis of amount of economic capital versus cash in order to support a certain VAR


If there is anything that we can do in order to help with the request, please let me know.  Again thank you very much for all of your help.  

Regards,
