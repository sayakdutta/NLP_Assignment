 Bob --

When should we file our complaint at the CPUC?

Jim

 

fyi -- this just came across my screen.


 




Diann,

Your billing dispute has been reviewed and SCE has determined that all
charges were correctly calculated. New accounts were established as a
result of the change in direct access status and financial relationship and
all amounts are properly due and owing.

Please feel free to contact your Account Manager Matt Pagano should you
require assistance with regard to payment.  These bills are due and payable
and subject to further collection activity which may include Late Payment
Charges and/or reversion to dual billing if they remain unpaid.

Please feel free to call me if you have any questions regarding this
matter.

Janet, I think I've cleaned this thoroughly.  Let me know if you find
discrepancies.  Thanks.

Janet,

With reference to the bills listed on the attached, pursuant to Rule 22 and
Rule
10A we are disputing that any charges are properly due and owing on these
accounts.  Each of these accounts has a credit balance.  We are therefore
withholding payment.
