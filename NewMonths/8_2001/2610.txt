Vince - You have been copied on this business case submittal per the
request from Joe Hrgovcic, as he has been in prior dicusssions with
Foresight.

Joe, 

Attached is the business case summary we discussed earlier today for
your review and assistance with contacting Enron Principal Investments. 
Please keep the document under tight control as all information is
strictly confidential.

The business case is primarily built around the model of Foresight
becoming an integrated weather service provider.  However, we are very
interested and aggressively pursuing the option of forming an exclusive
partnership with an energy/trading firm.

Please review and contact me via email or at one of the numbers below
with any questions or requests for further information.

Thank you again for your help.
