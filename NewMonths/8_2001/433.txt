Wayne:

I went to Tracy's office to help Cynthia look for the documents and Cynthia found them, so you should be getting copies shortly.

This is kind of scary (and not just because I need the documents).

 

just fYI

still trying to find the docs

 

I don't know off the top of my head where they are?  Is there a blue file?  Do I have a memo in my memo directory where I sent them to Contract Admin?

 


Hi Marie

Any idea where I can find the final docs for this deal?  Cynthia said she gave them to you -- I've looked in the regular places -- where else can I check?

thanks

Tracy
