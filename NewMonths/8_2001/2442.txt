Shawn,

Let's do lunch. It's long overdue. we have been planning it for a long time.

Vince:

I'd love to get together again soon.

Dan Reck and I were discussing various markets, and he suggested that I contact you about a question that I raised.

I was trying to find out what share of the eventual total cost of the net/net endusers' market of any liquid commodity should optimally be represented by the various intermediaries (risk management providers; repackagers; consolidators; knowledge based intermediaries/service providers; otherwise).

If I can invite you to lunch, that's great.  Otherwise, if you can spare 15 minutes, I greatly appreciate it.

Thanks

Shawn
