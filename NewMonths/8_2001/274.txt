Christel,
How are you? Hope you are doing well. I got your message last night about leaving the NW. Where are you going? When do you take off?
Drop me a note if you have a chance. 

Take care.
Bill

 

Please respond to cfredrikson
I'm back.  How was your weekend?  Still putting in long hours or is that over?  I'm pretty pissed. My five day weekend is over and I don't have any more vacation now until I graduate.  A whole month of no vacation????  Aughhhhh!  I'm never going to make it!
