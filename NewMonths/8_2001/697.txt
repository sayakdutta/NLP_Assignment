What was the explicity capacity ($/kw-mo) component by year for PECO in their stranded cost case?  Feel free to call JR.

Jim:

Below is the response I received from Daniel re: the ICAP component in PECO's stranded costs.  Does this answer your question?  I looked over dockets, etc. before contacting Daniel and hadn't found anything specific to ICAP deficiency charges.

My contact, JR Rohrbaugh, called back. He says that ICAP was explicitily included in the market value of the plants in the model.  The yearly market value had an energy componet and a capacity componet with the assumption that the capacity was compensation for installed capacity.  This revenue, less incremental cost of running the plants was the annual cash value of the plants which was then present valued.  That number less the book value was the stranded cost of the generation assets.   Hope this helps.  If Jim wants to talk to JR directly I have his number or e-mail.


   Daniel:

   At Jim Steffes' request, I am trying to determine the following - of the
   stranded costs sought by PECO in its original restructuring plan, what
   portion was for installed capacity deficiency charges?  I have read over
   a number of dockets, but haven't found mention of this.  I greatly
   appreciate your assistance.
