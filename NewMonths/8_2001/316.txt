Guys,
You can find out the information you need on the website.
The website is www.wscc.com, click on certification and training, scroll down to the Schedulers Course manual.  Print off the schedulers course manual and study it.  You will be tested on the material, a pre-test and a post-test. (note:you will need to access the site in Explorer to get the manuals).  You can call telephone# 801-582-0353 to get information on the scheduler's course (this is the main-line to WSCC so you will have to ask around a bit).

Please arrange for those on night shift to get in about 15-25 minutes early so you can leave at 5:10 on the 13th.
Thanks,
Bill
