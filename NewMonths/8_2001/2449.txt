A young professor from Michigan Univ. expresses
his desire to visit Enron. The following papers
are out of his interests in energy and broadband
markets and their copies are left to you
via Shirley.

Best regards,

Youyi





Dear Youyi Feng,

Firstly, I apologize that I haven't contacted you earlier; the reason is
that I've been very busy traveling. We met in Hawaii conference and I
promised to send the paper that I presented there to you. This paper is
now
enclosed and I hope you find the model useful, at least in the future.

In this bandwidth area I'm working closely with my friends (EigenValue
Ltd.)
and they've office in my home country Finland. In the electricity market
I've been consulting few electricity companies in Scandinavia and it
seems
that the market there is working pretty well. I also added one paper in
this
field.

In Hawaii you told me something about your interests in Revenue
Management
models. Fortunately, one of my friend, Costis Maglaras (Professor in

area
and he would be very happy to talk with you about the implementation of
these models into everyday industry practice.

If you are interested I'd very much like to visit Enron and give a talk
there. Especially, I'd like to learn more about your company, the
reputation
of Enron is impressive!

Best regards, Jussi
