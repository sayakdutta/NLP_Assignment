Attached is the form of pooling point purchase GTC for ENA Upstream.  This form still needs further refinements, but for August business I am comfortable to use.  However, John please specifically review the nomination variance language in the confirm.  Upon your approval, Ellen can move forward with August use.  Let me know if you have any questions.
