You'll love this.  ALCOA has sent us an amendment to the ISDA (that was signed 1/99) and wants to amend the "threshold amount" in Part 1 so that it corresponds to the current credit rating of the applicable party as indicated in Paragraph 13.  I think we are mixing apples and oranges!  Obviously they didn't understand the difference when they signed the ISDA in '99.  And it's the same lawyer sending the amendment who negotiated the master.
