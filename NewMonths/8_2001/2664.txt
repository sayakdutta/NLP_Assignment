Laura is going to fax me a map from the airport to the office.  Their
address is 236 Montezuma Avenue, Santa Fe.  I'll let you know how
much time is involved when I hear from her.

Vince,

This is great.  Please give me the physical address for Prediction and what time the meeting will finish.  I need to arrange ground transportation and advise when the plane will take off.  From the airport to their location, how much time should I allow for ground transportation?

Many Thanks,

Liz

Thanks for setting up the trip.


Vince
