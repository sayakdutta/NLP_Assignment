Sorry that I am just getting back to this.  I think that one of the key roles for Reg Risk Analytics is to "validate" the appropriateness of regulatory assumptions in EWS retail tariff curves as well as help Govt Affairs build risk management plans.  

Let's talk soon.

Jim,
What I meant is that, as part of the professional group --regulatory-- providing support to EES, we could start negotiating our participation in the review of the price curves sustaining the contracts, as part of our support. Tariffs have already been reviewed. Billing formulas are being analyzed and ready for most contracts. Consumption data has not been analyzed for any contract. Please advise. Regards,
ALF




Alberto --

Not sure what you mean by "prime time"?  Please provide some additional details.

Greetings,
Please find attached the latest update on the EES contracts' analysis, including responsible and contact persons, as well as customer name. In total, there are about 110 contracts. Please note that for Priority contracts, the 8 most urgent ones, documentation is 80% ready and analysis is 30% ready. For Tier I, 86 and 39% respectively. For Tier II, 88 and 0%. Consumption data is conspicuously unavailable, which is important for determining the positions. 

Billing data is being filled and its almost complete. Jim, this might mean that we could be ready for prime time. Please advise. Looking forward to talking with you all on Wednesday,
ALF
