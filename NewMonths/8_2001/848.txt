I am not sure if we have a claim to "PX Credits".  Our claim is to the negative residual of Bundled less the PX Credit = Negative CTC.

I enclosed blacklined versions of the riders for the proofs of claim for EES, EEMC and EPMI.  I also enclose the riders for the ECC and ENA claims, which have not changed from the versions circulated last night.

Please let me know your comments as soon as possible.
