Rick,

As you know we had Chad's evaluation yesterday and I'll be sending you a copy for your records.  I'm also attaching the Performance Improvement Plan and the instructions on how to complete it for your convenience.  Jim Steffes mentioned that he would like to assist in putting the PIP together and he will be contacting you.     

While completing the PIP you are encouraged to consider Chad's input before finalizing the development plan.  The plan should also address the specific performance areas and examples provided in the employee's evaluation. (This form must also be reviewed by legal before presenting.  Please email me a copy before setting-up your meeting with Chad.)

Please email or call me if you need additional information.

Sincerely,
Ivonne Brown
