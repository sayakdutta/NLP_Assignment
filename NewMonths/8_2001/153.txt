Because both Kim and Michelle are taking a 1/2 day of vacation on Friday afternoon, we ask that you submit your bullets to Kim by 3:00p Thursday afternoon. 

Kim, by the way, also has an offsite meeting on Friday morning and will have a difficult time compiling bullets for Steve by 11:00a.  

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.   

Thanks again,

Audrey D. Robertson
