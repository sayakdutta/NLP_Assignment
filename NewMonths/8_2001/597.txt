RE: Reliability Meeting
       ?Monday, August 20th, 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.

The Legislative and Regulatory Affairs Committees have scheduled a meeting on reliability legislation for Monday, August 20th from 10:00 am to 3:00 pm at EPSA's offices, 1401 New York Avenue, NW.  Lunch will be provided.  The purpose of the meeting is to review and discuss specific legislative proposals in order to develop fundamental positions on reliability legislation.  The proposals now being considered both on Capitol Hill and at FERC reflect dramatically different approaches.  Whichever is ultimately pursued will have significant implications for the scope of FERC jurisdiction and perhaps the nature or reliability standards themselves.
We have invited representatives from NERC and PJM, as well as Bonnie Suchman and Cindy Bogorad - all of whom have worked on different proposals on reliability.  These individuals will make presentations in support of their respective approaches and to answer any questions that EPSA members may have.



____ Yes, I would like to attend the Joint Regulatory/Legislative Affairs Committees Meeting on Reliability on Monday, August 20th from 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.
