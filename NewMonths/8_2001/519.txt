You are correct, 
The EOL trades were not properly acccounted for. 
We need FSP 2000, not FSP 2002...
I think we have it sorted out now though.

But yeah, too much stress is never healthy...I don't know exactly what the deal is.

I understand the issues with the new volume.
It is understandable we are going to have issues rolling something out like that.
I have just been concerned lately with Kate's stressed out state.

So what do you think happened last night.
How did the EOL trades mess us up?
Just curious as to how it is flowing.
Did the EOL trades not get captured in CAPS?

 

Things have definitely been difficult over here. In truth, I may have underestimated how prepared our systems and the folks in our group were to move dramatically greater volumes. We are moving through a period of adjustment and should be back on track by tomorrow.
So Kate probably is not any more stressed out than anyone else. She probably just shows it a bit more.
We shouldn't be holding you guys back too much longer.

My apologies for the delay.
Bill


 

Is Kate very stressed out lately?
I have just noticed that she is constantly angry - how are things going over there?
