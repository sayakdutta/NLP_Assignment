I am sure that John Lavorato will want to see a presentation for the Alberta Power Fundamentals.  To save the hassle of develop powerpoint slides.  Is there a way
that we can simply tie a projector to the computer and run it off of our website.  Additionally, can you enter the new known generation in the database. I am sure that he will want to see this as well.  He will be in the office on Wed afternoon.
