if you want a jet allocation we need to talk about it.  as fare as these folks are concerned they get zero hours.  make thaat clear to avaition, or call liz and tell her to cancel their authorization.

On a serious note - it would appear that a fair number of folks get personal allocations for the corporate jet.  Do I get any allocation for personal aircraft usage above my current compensation level?
