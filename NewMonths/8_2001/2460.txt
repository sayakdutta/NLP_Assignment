See Kenneth's note below.  Where does this stand?

Thanks!

Hi Shirley,

We're in Boston and are pretty much settled.  I'm wondering if you can help 
me wrap-up some details before school starts.  I have not yet received the 
final loan agreement papers from Enron.  I talked with Anne Labbe before I 
left, and again this week, and she's said that she expected legal to finish 
finalizing my papers, and I should have them by 8/10.  Have you heard 
anything about my agreement?  The registration fee for school is due next 
week, so I would like to have everything resolved pretty soon if possible.

Thanks for your help.
