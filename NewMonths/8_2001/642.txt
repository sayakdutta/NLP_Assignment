Good idea.  Harry is the best to start with.

Jim -- Thought you might want to see what our outside counsel sent (and I did submit an RCR).  Hated to be the bearer of bad news but it looks like our business guys need to find another state, at least for now.  

I thought I would talk to Mr. Kingerski about getting assistance both on following up on NC and on handling the reports for the other states, unless you have other suggestions.

Looks good.  Please make sure that you submitted an RCR.  

If Ed wants more info of this type for other states, I'd like to make sure that we organize our efforts so we don't duplicate too much and deploy the proper resources.

Thanks,

Jim
