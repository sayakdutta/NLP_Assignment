 



Good Afternoon Vince, 
 
The HR Associate & Analyst program received Jill Schoenemann's resume from Beth Perlman earlier this month.  
 
I spoke with Jill to discuss the program with her and conveyed to her that compared with other candidates, she would be suited more as an analyst.  Currently, we are only hiring at the Associate level.  I also told Jill that the HR Associate/Analyst program was not the only way to begin a career in HR with Enron.  Jill will be one of the first we consider when we are hiring at the Analyst level later this year.  
 
Thank you for your further recommendation of a great candidate.  I will let you know when we are seeking to hire more HR Analysts.  
 
Kind Regards,
 
Adrianne Engler
HR Analyst
