On a monthly basis I will be verifying information such as your titles, locations, extension, fax numbers, & supervisors to help Office of the Chairman for Enron Wholesale Services keep track of all the Admin Assitants in the group.  

Please let me know if the information pertaining to you is correct on the list. If it is not, please forward me the correct info.
