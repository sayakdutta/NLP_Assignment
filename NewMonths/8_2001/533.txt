Seems to make sense to put out a "What's Up in Sacramento" to the whole business crew with likelihood of success.  Best to come from you.

The Assembly working group on ABX2 82 is preparing new amendments based on
yesterday's meetings.  The amendments will make 82 look even more like the
Senate bill than the previous version.  Direct access will remain in 82 with
some supposedly minor modifications.  DA will be authorized effective in
January 2002 at the sole discretion of the CPUC with some non-bypassable
charge.  There is still no number for the core/non-core dividing line.  The
Democrats still face obstacles within their own party and it is unclear if
they have the votes to pass this proposal.  They expect no support from
Republicans.

Assemblyman Keeley is going to meet with the following Senators today and
tomorrow to see if the Senate is willing to budge at all; Burton, Sher,
Bowen, Dunn and Peace.  The Assembly is not sure if they will bring up the
bill if they do not reach consensus with the Senate.
