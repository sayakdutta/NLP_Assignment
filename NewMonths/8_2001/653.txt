Sue --

My take on this letter is that it is a little too "jumpy".  Any way to help make it a bit more to help Lynch do something different - maybe work from the AReM filing?

Here is the latest letter



















DAC members:

I need to know as soon as possible if your organizations can sign on to the
attached letter--it's a shorter, streamlined version of what you saw before.
Dorothy Rothrock of CMTA boiled down the previous version to the core issues
that the majority of DAC members appear to support.  As before, please also
let me know if you cannot sign on to the letter--which will save us
pestering you with phone calls.  For those of you who aren't signing on to
any letter because of the language supporting SB 18xx--you don't have to
call me again because this version still contains that reference. I have
"starred" the organizations that have already signed on to this version.

The Edelman team is ready to roll as soon as we hear from you.  Thanks again
for acting quickly on this.
