Given Greg Whalley's schedule, the best day for us to visit with you at Santa Fe
would be Wednesday, September the 5th. WE would arrive from San Francisco, early in the morning
and we could stay through the day.

Please, let me know if this date would work for you.

Vince

 

Vince,

I have heard back from Dave Weinberger regarding the date of your
visit.  He is available both days but prefers the 31st.  Please let me
know as soon as possible which day you have chosen for your visit.

Thank you,

Laura
