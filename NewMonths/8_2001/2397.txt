  Dear Sandeep,

  You can download the materials of our early studies from

  http://homepage2.nifty.com/mcbm/

  We have made many documents about our model. Unfortunately,
  they have been written in Japanese. If you can understand
  Japanese, I can send some of them quickly.

  It takes several weeks to send "Application that you have
  developed (e.g. for Daiwa)". There are some NDAs with Daiwa.
  We, therefore, must check whether the documents satisfy with
  the NDA, or not.

  In the current stage, I hope only open information.

  Best regards,
  Yuji Uenohara
