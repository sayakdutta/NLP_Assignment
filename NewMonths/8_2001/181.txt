I probably prefer the 3 or 17.  Let's get the rest of our invites together this weekend.  ILY, K.




I've put a hold on those three Saturdays in November.  Take a look at your
calendar and let's narrow it down from there.

Couples:

Jane & Barry Hill
Lee & ___ Farrell
? (possibly Mark & ___ Montondon)

ILY,
JW




John,
Thank you for the invitation.  We'd love to come.  We don't have any plans
for Saturday, November 3rd, 10th or 17th.  Let us know.  Have a good weekend
and say hello to Kim.

Thanks again,
Jane
