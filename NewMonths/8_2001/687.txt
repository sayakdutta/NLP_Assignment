Linda -

Pls work with Brian Redmond's asst to have a meeting with me, him, Jean Ryall, and Becky Cantrell.

Thx.



 

Jim, Brian has been working with Jean Ryall on Texas issues and he assumed she would be the right person for the Pat Wood contact.  He sent her a draft of a letter last night in fact.  (See below).

The PowerPoint presentation is one that he made to TRRC staff.  

He wants to push on both fronts (Texas and Federal) to get more competition in the state.  Said he would like to get together, but he's out Thursday, Friday, Monday and Tuesday.  Linda can get with his assistant and set something up for late next week if you are available.

 

FYI

 

 

Jean,

Please find the attached letter to Pat Wood as follow up to our meeting last week.  Please modify with your thoughts and resend.  

Also, should we visit with Max Yzagurie at the Texas PUC?

Regards,
Brian
