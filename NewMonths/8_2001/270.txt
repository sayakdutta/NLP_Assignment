I was talking to John Lavorato just this morning and he said that he e-mailed you a memo that described the topics that he wanted to talk about next week. 
Do you have a copy of that?

 

John, you will see that a number of topics that Lavo wanted to cover with you and your trading group can be illustrated through the use of the performance metrics that are being put together. You may want to use these v. creating new ones.

 

We should have everything except the Profitability vs VAR report.  I am working with Frank Hayden in Houston on this, but we may not have it next week.  Let me know if that's a problem.
Thanks
Peg

 

Peggy, Grant: I would like to use the performance metrics when Lavorato is here next week (august 9/10). Will they be in final form by then. pls advise. thx
