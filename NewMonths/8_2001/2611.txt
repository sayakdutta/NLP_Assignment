Gayle,

Thanks for the invitation. Let's connect in the beginning of November to discuss the details.

Vince

 

Thank you for agreeing to speak for the HEG, an industry group within the
National Association of Credit Management.  "Price Volatility in the US
Power Markets" is a topic of great interest to many of us. The meeting time
is 11:30 - 1pm and the November meeting is scheduled to be in the El Paso
building.  I will confirm details with you as the date approaches to confirm
that the room has the equipment you will need for your presentation.  Please
mark your calendar.  We look forward to seeing you then.
