Vince,

Just a reminder to let you know that I have still not received the following performance reviews from you:

Shirley 
Sandeep 
Krishna 
Zimin
Maureen
Mike
Vasant
Tanya

If you have completed these reviews, please send them to me as soon as possible.  However, if you have not had a chance to sit down with these employees and discuss their performance and objectives for the next six months, please do so in the near future so that the employee will have ample opportunity to make the necessary adjustments and/ or complete their 6 month objectives.

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.  

Thanks in advance for your help
Anne,
