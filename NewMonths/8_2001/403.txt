You probably would have caught this anyway, but it looks like BP Amoco's (your CP's) name has changed.

See message below...Looks like BP changed their name to BP Corporation North America Inc.

 

Kim,

Can you inform Janet that BP has changed its name recently.  New name is BP Corporation North America, Inc.

Thanks,
Joe

Mark and Stacy:
Because paragraph 2 of our form contemplates that there are annexes attached, if there end up being none after each group has had its input, I suggest that the last attorney reviewing the agreement delete that paragraph.  (Note that Power has no Annex to attach to BP's version.)  Thanks!
