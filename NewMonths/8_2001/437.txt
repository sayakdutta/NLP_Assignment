Mr. Lopez-Velarde:

Pursuant to our conversation attached is the form of guaranty that one of our business groups would like to send to a Mexican counterparty.  Francisco has asked if you would please revise the guaranty to provide for agent for service of process, submission to governing law in Texas and submission to jurisdiction in U.S. courts in Texas.  It appears that the form includes submission to jurisdiction in Texas and I have included a provision regarding agent for service of process.

As I stated, we would like to have these revisions as soon as possible this afternoon.

Thank you for your assistance.

Marie
