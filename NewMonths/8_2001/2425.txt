Liz, Greg:

Frank Wolak from Stanford will be back in the office on Tuesday,
August 7. I hope to set up a meeting with him and then to finalize
the meeting with Prediction Co.  I shall be shooting for August 23 - 24,
in view of Greg's trip on the 15th and 16th.

I left a message for Norman Packard, telling him that I should be  able
to get back to him regarding the trip to Santa Fe by Tuesday this week.

The first draft of the non-disclosure agreement will be ready by Tuesday
or Wednesday.

Have a good trip.

Frank,

Greg Whalley and I are planning another trip to a California.
The trip is most likely to take place on the 16th - 17th of August
or a week later (23rd - 24th of August). Are you available for an afternoon
meeting and / or dinner on Thursday, August 16 or August 23? 

We are very interested in your thoughts about the directions of the power 
markets across the US.
