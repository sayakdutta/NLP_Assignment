It's on my calendar.  Unless I need to be in California, I'll go to DC.

Hi Jim, 
 
Just wanted to let you know that Intellibridge will be meeting with Linda and team in DC on Sept 6 at 2pm. Several of the Intellibridge analysts will be attending and we would love to have you. Hope you can make it! 
 
Thanks, MSA
